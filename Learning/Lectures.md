I try to use lectures on youtube as a form of a podcast, where I can listen to the lecturer while doing other things. I think this system is very good when it comes to most of the historical and philosophical and social sciences, sometimes it works okay for economics as well. I have not tried to much to listen to technical mathematical or engineering lectures. 


# Lecture List


### [American Civil War](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DD220D6A1282057)
*This course explores the causes, course, and consequences of the American Civil War, from the 1840s to 1877. The primary goal of the course is to understand the multiple meanings of a transforming event in American history. Those meanings may be defined in many ways: national, sectional, racial, constitutional, individual, social, intellectual, or moral. Four broad themes are closely examined: the crisis of union and disunion in an expanding republic; slavery, race, and emancipation as national problem, personal experience, and social process; the experience of modern, total war for individuals and society; and the political and social challenges of Reconstruction.*
- This was a very interesting course. Liked, in particular, the understanding of the economic factors behind the war, and some cool highlights. Definitely recommend. 
- The [Dred Scott ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford)decision was probably the most catastrophic Supreme Court decision ever. 
- In regards to warfare and warfare production, then there was a massive difference in industrial output. 
- **The American civil war was a war about slavery.**
- Slaves were the most valuable "commodity" in the US except land. Extremely much money in this business.
- Free-soilers were anti-slavery because they feared the "planters" and their almost nobility-like way of doing farming. There was little humanitarianism.

### Economics Introduction



### [Early Middle Ages](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77A337915A76F660) 
*Major developments in the political, social, and religious history of Western Europe from the accession of Diocletian to the feudal transformation. Topics include the conversion of Europe to Christianity, the fall of the Roman Empire, the rise of Islam and the Arabs, the "Dark Ages," Charlemagne and the Carolingian renaissance, and the Viking and Hungarian invasions.*

- Fun to learn about Arab history after the establishment of Islam
- Charlemagne was fun to hear about. 
- The most fun was probably the million different types of Christianity. 


### [Power and Politics in Todays world](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyViG2ar68jkgEi4y6doNZy)
*This course provides an examination of political dynamics and institutions over this past tumultuous quarter century, and the implications of these changes for what comes next. Among the topics covered are the decline of trade unions and enlarged role of business as political forces, changing attitudes towards parties and other political institutions amidst the growth of inequality and middle-class insecurity, the emergence of new forms of authoritarianism, and the character and durability of the unipolar international order that replaced the Cold War.* 

- Interesting, especially in the discussions around non-western countries.  Especially the discussion about South Africa was interesting. 
- Also, Thaterisms were interesting, as well as discussions around unions. [The longest Suicide Note in History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_longest_suicide_note_in_history)
- 3-changes rule, where a stable democracy can be assumed after 3 switches of ruling parties.

- [Merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)  where interesting concept.
- Impressed with the technology behind the bitcoin. 



# Thoughts 
- Open Culture has an interesting list of youtube channels [Link](https://www.openculture.com/smartyoutube)
- I usually find the MiT and Yale courses on Youtube to be the best and easiest to access. 
- Youtube premium makes it easy to listen to courses as downloadable and outside of the youtube player. Godsend.
