# Data Science

What is data science? It is a bunch of different jobs bunched together and given the tie of AI to make a company sound innovative. 

As a data scientist, I consider myself a solver of probabilistic problems.  I have business cases that require some sort of probabilistic solution. 



# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, is the bread and butter of most data scientists. It is being an analyst on steroids. EDA can be everything from notebooks and CSV files to machine-learning proof of concepts. 

Things to keep in mind in the EDA. 
1. When you have a "finding",  you should try your best to disprove it. 
2. Beware of data myopia, seeing only a narrow part of the data you are working on. 
3. Notebooks are notebooks, not code. Real reusable code should be in python files, not notebooks.

- [When too much evidence is bad](https://phys.org/news/2016-01-evidence-bad.html) Interesting article that argues when the results are too good to be true then it probably is. If there are some fantastic numbers all everything is correct then something is off. We expect that data shows some inconsistencies. 

# Thoughts 
- A machine learning (ML) model is a software artifact “compiled” from data
