# Data Science

What is data science? It is a bunch of different jobs bunched together and given the tie of AI to make a company sound innovative. 

As a data scientist, I consider myself a solver of probabilistic problems.  I have business cases that require some sort of probabilistic solution. 



# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, is the bread and butter of most data scientists. It is being an analyst on steroids. EDA can be everything from notebooks and CSV files to machine-learning proof of concepts. 

Things to keep in mind in the EDA. 
1. When you have a "finding," you should try your best to disprove it. 
2. Beware of data myopia, seeing only a narrow part of the data you are working on. 
3. Notebooks are notebooks, not code. Actual reusable code should be in Python files, not notebooks. 


# Uncertainty
- **Aleatoric uncertainty**: Label Nouse (Labels have been flipped to other classes)
-  **Epistemic uncertainty**: Model Noise (erroneous predicted probabilities)

If there are some fantastic numbers and everything is correct, then something is off. We expect that data shows some inconsistencies.

# Thoughts 
- A machine learning (ML) model is a software artifact “compiled” from data.
- *Selection bias*: Training data is not representative of the real world. The distribution of training data does not match real-world deployment distribution. This happens for a lot of reasons. Examples are Time, over-filtering data, rare events, and convenience-based collections. (Only survey your friends or in a single location.)
- [A famous empiricist once said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” In Bayesian terms, the stronger we make our model–following the excellent precepts of Jeffreys and Jaynes–the more able we will be to find the model’s flaws and thus perform scientific learning.](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/05/07/bayes_jeffreys/)
