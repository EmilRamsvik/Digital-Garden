# AI
This is where I write about AI and Data Science. As I work as a data scientist/machine learning engineer, I read a lot of books on machine learning and AI and try to develop my skills and knowledge on the topic. 
I tried to dangle a bit into [AI Strategy](AI%20Strategy.md) and discuss what I have learned and what I thought was a good way of approaching AI as a strategic asset and opportunity. 

### [Data Science](Data%20Science/Data%20Science.md)

I think the notes on the [Data Science Project Start-Up Phase](Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20Project%20Start-Up%20Phase.md) are cool; I have worked a lot on the data science aspect of projects and have learned some hard-learned lessons, and I think a lot of those will be of interest. 
I really thought the [Confident Learning](Data%20Science/Confident%20Learning.md) topic was of interest, and I recommend going there to get more knowledge about that topic. 


## [NLP or LLM](Language/NLP%20or%20LLM.md) 
I wrote a lot about LLMs in 2023, and some of this might be a bit outdated, but I still think that it is very much a good starting point for LLMs.

# Thoughts 
- Even though machine learning LLMs such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLama are non-deterministic. There are a few parameters that determine the output; there are few outputs that determine the inconsistence
	- *Seed* - a random number that the model uses to start calculations.
	- *System Fingerprint* - describes the state of the engine.
	- *temperature / top_p* - how the model samples based on log probability
