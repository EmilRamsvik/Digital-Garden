# Talks

Here i list the talks I have heard or found intersting. It contains some of the cool and intersting talks that I hear. Some might be interesting. 



### List of talks that I have found intersting
- [Pushing Through Friction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bxZuzDKoI0&list=WL&index=17&t=7s) Based on my own experience as a developer, this was a very intersting talk that resonated with me. 
- [Provacative predictions for the future.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otyoPiVAicI&ab_channel=Summit) I found it intersting, good talk. I think it might be taken with a grain of salt. Furthermore, it is a bit provacatibve, so might be completely wrong. Fun terms were *revenge travel*, *patagonia vest index* etc. 
	- Tesla did not disrupt car industry, but rather disrupt the gas station industry.
	- Disruption is more a fucntion of how disruptable the industry rather than the disruptable technology. 
	- And note: This man predicted that Macys would be bigger than amazon. 
- [Sessions of talks](https://www.youtube.com/@SummitSessions/videos) Many good ones, liked [SpaceX approach to exponential growth](https://youtu.be/ZOWakxXjotg?si=2MuirGP0ZYkGzVOT)
- [Finish Intelligence Officer Analysing Russia](https://youtu.be/CvonRMSuFpw?si=tLBfoLaUG1-Hn6wL) I found this quite intersting when it comes to understanding the geopolitcal history of eastern europe and also understanding how the Russian government thinks.
