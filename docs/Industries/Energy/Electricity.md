A forward curve is the estimation of the price of a good based on futures contracts. So, for example, if the contract is over monthly prices, then you use that, if the contract is over quarters, then you use it. This is because there might not be contracts on a monthly basis. 

A forward curve is for the business in a commodity to understand the different possibilities of the market. This is what the market thinks the price of the good will be in that period.
