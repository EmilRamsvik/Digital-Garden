I link to a couple of different segments within energy here. I think there are enough similarities between segments such as oil and gas to group them and write about the overarching themes here.

- [How the World Really Works](../../Books/Book%20Reviews/How%20the%20World%20Really%20Works.md)  A little bit about how energy is driving. 
- [How Big Things Get Done](../../Books/Book%20Reviews/How%20Big%20Things%20Get%20Done.md) Might be interesting in the context of big power projects, and why solar power, with its modularity, is interesting. Solar power costs have decreased exponentially.
