# Flexibility
I started working on flexibility far too late, but it is an awesome way of doing quick workouts at home. 

All you need is a phone with some guidance, a yoga mat, and maybe a pillow. As long as you are alone, you don't even need clothes :).

### Thoughts 
- Hot yoga is quite cool. Relaxing and in winter time in Norway it is very good to have some warmth in your body.
