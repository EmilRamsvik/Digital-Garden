# Strength Training
I started strength training when I was 17, and did some on and off until I was 19. From 19 to 24, I consistently worked out between 3 and 5 days a week.  I did a lot of failing and needed a lot of guidance during that period. First of all, I started with only upper body exercises and neglected to work out my legs for quite a while. I think this was because I was not flexible enough to do the squat exercises correctly. In hindsight, it is difficult to assess in hindsight what the causation for the lack of leg exercises, but I am certain the lack of flexibility made doing leg workouts quite a bit difficult. 



## Functional Training


I found working out using kettlebells and dumbbells to be very effective and should be part of the routine for most people. Doing correct kettlebell exercises can be difficult, but I found the following videos to be of help.
- [Pavel Tsatsouline Enter The KettleBell](https://youtu.be/cKx8xE8jJZs) Good intro, with a Soviet theme, which to me is too gimmicky but has good guidance on the fundamentals. 
- [Obi Vincent Workouts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6G9fPqougk6c93KSpvzGhHKCxY-RZ8O) I have found a lot of inspiration when it comes to exercises using just kettlebells or dumbells, not always following the routines slavishly.


### Favourite Exercises

- Warm up by Doing Pump exercise, or the upward/downward facing dog.

#### Kettlebell Exercises

- [American Kettlebell swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d94xX-AQZ0A&ab_channel=Onnit) I like it as it is a more thorough kettlebell exercise than just a normal "Russian" swing.
- [Normal Kettlebell Swing](https://youtu.be/cKx8xE8jJZs?t=549) The old favourite. Good for warming up as well
- [Kettlebell Snatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm-b2XFeABA&ab_channel=CrossFit) is Probably my favorite kettlebell exercise. I think it combines both technique and the involvement of muscles in a good way. It is also a cool exercise.

### EMOM 
EMOM stands for Every Minute On the Minute, a principle used in strength training. At the start of each minute, you perform a specific exercise for a certain number of reps. The remaining time within that minute is for rest before the next round begins. I found this to be a good way to finish off a workout.  A good example of this is the [bye-bye legs EMOM](https://youtu.be/Zf9ElVivHC4?list=PLj6G9fPqougk6c93KSpvzGhHKCxY-RZ8O&t=732)

# Thoughts 
- Strength training is super good with some kind of partner. It keeps you both accountable and it is motivating to work out together. 
- I found the ["Sally"](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/why-bu/sportbu/premium-portal/bring-sally-challenge) workout to be a nice finisher, especially squats on leg day. When it comes to push-ups, I usually find it too hard as a finisher to complete.  
- Deadlift is the ultimate exercise. It should be a staple of all strength training programs.  I like to start with a deadlift and then do more functional training later.
