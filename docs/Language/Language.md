# Language



## Italian 



## English
The English language is very rich and encompassing. It is a mix of three different languages: Saxon, Old Norse, and French. After the battle of Hastings in 1066, French culture dominated the court and nobility.

Doctors, economists, lawyers and many others, not to single out any particular professions, erect moats of obfuscation around their professions to maintain their status and pay grade. George Bernard Shaw called this the [Conspiracies against the laity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracies_against_the_laity),  in the spirit of this article, noting that laity is a term for the layman or average man.
