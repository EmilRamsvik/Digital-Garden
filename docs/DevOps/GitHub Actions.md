# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are written in YAML file format. There are multiple ways of triggering GitHub actions, related to git-actions such as push/pull requests. But also cron schedules. It is a cheap and flexible way of doing simple jobs. One good advantage is that all the functions are in the same repo. One source of truth. 

I find GitHub Actions to be more durable and easy to work with than Lambda Functions etc.
