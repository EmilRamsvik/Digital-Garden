# Snowflake
#unfinished 
Snowflake is a company providing a data warehouse. 

Snowflake has both storage and processing capabilities, which makes you able to do a lot of the work in Snowflake itself.  Snowflake uses SQL to make queries. 


### Snowpark
Snowpark is the "ML Framework" of Snowflake. Snowpark is used to do modeling and ml-ops. It is based on the XGboost and scikit-learn frameworks; their APIs are similar as much as can be done. The advantage of Snowpark is that its integration with the enterprise data warehouse makes it much easier to work with data and integrate the solutions with the users.
