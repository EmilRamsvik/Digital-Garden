## Luang Prabang
Luang Prabang is an old city, sitting on the banks of the Mekong River. Filled with old French colonial architecture, it is a good place to visit. Laotian food is explicitly good and visiting the restaurants and eating the local cuisine was a hightail. The night market contains a lot of cheap but nice things to buy, clothes, paintings, and other stuff. Also the food there was super good.

Eating Laos sausage, traveling around the different places with a big pickup truck. Sitting on the edge of the Mekong and enjoying a coffee.  Make your own armband. 

## Food
[Laos sausage](https://www.saengskitchen.com/laorecipes/laosausage). This is one of my favorites.  

The national dish is Larb, which is a meat salad. It is flavored with mint leaves and is quite a hot dish. Usually enjoyed with sticky rice. 
Also, Mango sticky rice is a must.
