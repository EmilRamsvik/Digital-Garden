# Description
Bali is an Island in Indonesia. It is an excellent place to be, but it is full of tourists and digital nomads. There is almost a sub-culture there. 


## Best Experiences
Surfing was a highlight, and it was easy to learn to surf there. Uluwatu is known as a surfer's paradise. 

In Ubud, there are lots of retreats for yoga and meditation. I went to a silent retreat. It was very cool to go there and experience being detached from modern life's stress and constant disturbances. 

## Souvenirs 


## Food
- Pork Belly Satay was super lovely. It is called *Sate Babi Samcan* [Youtube Rudimentary Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4iA8AWNDr4&list=WL&index=16&t=9s)
- There were many different vegan options; one thing I noticed was all the breakfast and *brekkie* places. It was very noticeable.

# Thoughts 
- Bali is predominantly a Hindi Island, which might explain why it is so popular as a meditation retreat. 
- Everyone there was super polite and nice. 
- I quite liked the places I visited. 
- When on a silent retreat, I experienced caffeine withdrawals.
