# Description


## Best Experiences
Singapore is the heart of South East Asia (SEA). I think some of the best experiences are related to just immersion in the different cultures that are the heart of the city-state.  Chinatown and Little India are definitely places I can recommend. 

Also, east coast park when there is a sunset. Watching the lights of the hundreds of ships in the strait are definitely an experience of a lifetime. 

A Singapore visit is definitely not complete without a visit to:

- **Gardens by the Bay** is a Very cool place to visit. Go and see the light show and from there go to Marina Bay Sands and take a drink. 
- **East Coast Park** Go there at sundown and then see the ships in Singapore Straight light up. Also fun for running exercises.

### **Important things to consider before going to Singapore:**

1. **Grab Application**:
   - **What is it?** Grab is primarily a transportation app in Singapore, similar to Uber.
   - **Why should you care?** It's one of the most convenient ways to get around the city. You can also use it as an alternative to cash some places. 
   - **Action Step**: Download the Grab app and make sure to add your payment card to it.

2. **Cash**:
   - **What is it?** Physical money, of course! But in Singapore, it's particularly important at hawker centers.
   - **Why should you care?** While many places in Singapore accept card payments, hawker centers (popular open-air food courts) often operate on cash or app-based payments.
   - **Action Step**: Ensure you have cash on hand, especially when visiting hawker centers. A typical meal usually costs between 5 and 10 dollars, depending on drinks and other add-ons. 

3. **Clothing**:
   - **What is it?** A reminder about the indoor climate.
   - **Why should you care?** While Singapore has a tropical climate, indoor areas like offices can be quite chilly due to air conditioning.
   - **Action Step**: It's smart to pack a light sweater or some warm clothing. You might need it, especially in office settings. It is also nice on flights as well.

3. **Immigration**:
   - **What is it?** You need to submit an immigration declaration among other things before arriving.  Note: Only 2 days before can you fill it in. 
   - **Why should you care?** It is annoying to do this when arriving and tired.
