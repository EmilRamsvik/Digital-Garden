# Oslo
I live in Oslo, and I think that this is more of a nice little guide to people who have not been there.

## Best Experiences
One of the best things in oslo is the closeness to nature. And depending on the season, there are a lot of great things to do. 

In the summertime, early autumn, and late spring, I think being able to go out in the fjord and explore is very nice.  Go to [VisitOslo](https://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/boroughs/oslo-fjord/attractions/) to see the island and how to get there.

Also, I can highly recommend, if you are up to a mini-walk/hike, to walk up from [Storo to Grefsenkollen](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Storo,+0485+Oslo/Grefsenkollen+restaurant,+Grefsenkollveien,+Oslo/@59.9517806,10.7822992,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x46416e3d2c622943:0xa5f44d3ec9090ff6!2m2!1d10.7784683!2d59.9447924!1m5!1m1!1s0x464171df7343b3df:0x4226d90f04122d3!2m2!1d10.8039787!2d59.9587824!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). (You can also take the bus, but it is not that long of a walk (1 hour)). 



## Food


### Asian Cuisine

- [Izakaya](https://izakayaoslo.com/index-eng.html) Classis Izakaya resturnat. Feels like you are in Tokyo, and it has good and reasonable food. Probably my favorite restaurant in Oslo. A bit difficult to find as there are no official signs or other markings. Also, no way to reserve a table. It is worth waiting for, for sure.
- [Kanpai](https://www.kanpai.no/) is Also an Izakay-style resturant. Also quite good but more posh. You can reserve it. 
- [Hrminir Ramen](https://book.dinnerbooking.com/no/nb-NO/book/index/1838/22) Good ramen place, close to LÃ¸kka.
- [SydOst](https://www.sudost.no/booking) SEA  (South East Asian) Food. 

### Western 
I am using Singapore slang for Western food, although the cuisine from these places is more than steaks, fries and some coleslaw (Do not forget the beans).
- [Apostrophe](https://www.restaurant-apostrophe.com/) has Splendid service, excellent food, very nice location. If it is warm enough, sit outside and enjoy the fantastic location.

### Mich


- [Haralds Vaffel](https://www.haraldsvaffel.no/) Really nice to grab an authentic Haralds Vaffel and enjoy very authentic Norwegian Vaffel.
- [King Falafel](https://no.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190479-d15850818-Reviews-King_Falafel-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html) Vegan,
