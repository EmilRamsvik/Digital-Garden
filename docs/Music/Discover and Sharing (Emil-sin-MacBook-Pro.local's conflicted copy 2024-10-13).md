# Discover and Sharing
I try to expand my musical horizon as much as possible. So that I can have music for all my moods and situations. Most of all, the music I discover is either through Spotify or YouTube, but sometimes I think that the best experiences are going to a festival or concert and getting introduced to new artists. 

I love sharing things that I discover, and I believe that sharing things that interest me is of great importance for building relationships. 

I send out almost weekly songs to people who I am close to and want to share what I have discovered with people. I mostly do it to share and show that I care by giving a small music sample every Friday.  This was something I did during the years 2022-2023, and then I felt like this was enough, and I wanted to stop doing it.
