# ✍️ My Top  Quotes

- *Can you spot the grammatical error? It’s surprisingly hard to see because of a trick that our mind plays on us, but it should pop out with emphasis: “Paris in the the springtime.” When a line break separates two occurrences of the same word, our brain tends to ignore the duplicate. The effect is called a lexical illusion.* 
 
- *The substitute command allows us to find and replace one chunk of text with another. The command’s syntax looks like this: ​  :\[range\]s\[ubstitute\]/\{pattern\}/\{string\}/\[flags\]* 
 
- *On the Etymology of Grep Consider this abbreviated form of the :global command: ​=>  ​:g/re/p​ re stands for regular expression, and p is short for :print, which is the default \[cmd\]. If we ignore the / symbols, we find the word “grep.”* 
 
- *“Do one thing, and do it well” is a principle of Unix philosophy. Vim provides wrapper commands that make it easy to call external programs such as make or grep.*
