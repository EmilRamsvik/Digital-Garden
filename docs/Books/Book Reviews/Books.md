# Books



# Books 
Books are an excellent way to engage yourself in something completely. It is one of my favorite ways to learn and understand things, and I want to be able to read every day. 


I usually try to read before I go to sleep; the ritual makes me sleepy and prepares me to sleep. 


# Non-Fiction
I mostly read non-fiction, as I usually do not find it that difficult to get into nonfiction books. I think it is due to the fact that a lot of the context in non-fiction is set; you know the world, you know what the premisses are, and therefore, you do not have to use a lot of mental capacity.  


# Fiction
Fiction is something that is important to read, and great works may stay with you for a long time. There is no shame in reading fantasy or science fiction.

# Thoughts 
- Books demand your attention in a very different way than other things. If you stop reading, then you stop, period. This means that phones, TVs, and other distractions are basically just that, distractions. When I started to read again seriously, I constantly reached for my phone to check it. It was strange to really see how little attention span I had. 
- Reading disciplines you to take time and concentrate on just one thing. This is important in a distracted society.
