# Books



# Books 
I think books are a good way to engage yourself in something completely. It is one of my favorite ways to learn and understand things, and I want to be able to read every day. 


I usually try to read before I go to sleep, I find that the ritual makes me sleepy and prepares me to go to sleep. 


# Non-Fiction
I mostly read non-fiction, as I usually do not find it that difficult to get into things. 


# Fiction
I think fiction is something that is important to read, and great works may stay with you for a long time. There is no shame in reading fantasy or science fiction.

# Thoughts 
- Books demand your attention in a very different way than other things. If you stop reading then you stop, period. This means that phones, TVs, and other distractions are basically just that, distractions. When I started to seriously read again, I found myself constantly reaching for my phone to check it. It was strange to really see how little attention span I had. 
- Reading disciplines you to take time and concentrate on just one thing. This is important in a distracted society.
