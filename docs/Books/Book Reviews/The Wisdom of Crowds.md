# The Wisdom of Crowds


# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
Last book (for now) in the first law series. It is a good and interesting fantasy book in that it emulates the French Revolution. I quite liked it and how it portrays a turbulent age where power dictates the fate of life. 

# 🎨 Impressions
Not many books are that interesting in that they portray backstabbing, backroom deals, and the mob as well. Good reading and fun to read. I would recommend it based upon just the joy of reading. 

## How I Discovered It
The first law, needed to finish the second trilogy. 

## Who Should Read It?
People who like fantasy.
