# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about understanding that communication is listening objectively and empathetically. By evaluating we are perceived as judging, which is not a good or effective way of communicating.  Express yourself through describing how you feel rather than what is affecting you. 

# üé® Impressions
It was a bit of a 60s vibe of the book, it was not a particularly gripping read, but I thought it was a cool book all in all. The point is maybe being better at communicating and maybe i should try to think about this more and being better at following through on the advice. Sometimes I feel like communication is like driving a motorbike, you have to train your brain to do things that it is conditioned to avoid. And just like on a motorcycle, if you do the conditioned thing you crash. 

## How I Discovered It

Hacker news probably. 
## Who Should Read It?
People who cannot communicate or have trouble expressing their feelings. 

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
This book is the last in a long line of books where I read about communicating and hope that I can condition myself to be a better one. Step by step I might be improving.
