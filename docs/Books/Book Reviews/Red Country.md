#  The Book in 3 Sentences
It is a fantasy book that takes inspiration from the Wild West area, with impulses from a lot of different settings from previous books. Mostly a story about traveling and challenges, as well as a few twists and turns. Mostly a book that is easy to read. 

# 🎨 Impressions
