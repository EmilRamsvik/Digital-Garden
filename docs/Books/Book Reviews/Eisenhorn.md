# Eisenhorn

# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
A fantasy set in the 40k universe. The book is about the adventures of Eisenhorn the Inquisitor and his retinue. It is fantasy through and through but fun and engaging through 3 stories. 

# 🎨 Impressions
I liked it in a way, I have read it before and it was a good read then as well. It is an interesting and cool way of doing fantasy and not too into the basics of the lore, which is good. 

## How I Discovered It
I wanted to read some 40k. 

## Who Should Read It?
People who like sci-fi fantasy.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
Not much changed, it is fun and engaging to read but would not recommend it as it is a bit fringe.
