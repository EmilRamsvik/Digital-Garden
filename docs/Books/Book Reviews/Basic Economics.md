# Basic Economics


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
Prices work, and competition works; if someone wants to limit the free market, it is usually a good indicator that they want to make money on it. 

This book covers the basics of economics and why they work in a clear way. It gives the reader clear and good examples of how the economy functions. 

# üé® Impressions
I felt it gave me a better understanding of the core principles of economics and how they are applied. Not very difficult to understand concepts which made it easier to read and reflect on. 

## How I Discovered It
I think I discovered it on a Hacker News thread. 

## Who Should Read It?
I think reading a book such as this is important for everyone that is interested in politics and society. If this book is easy to read, then it is no excuse for people not to read it. If you don't understand the principles of economics, you are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past. 

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
I think I became more aware of my tendency to bias myself against issues that I know are right but my personal preferences have made me against it. One example is being very lenient about banning cars and removing parking spaces because personally, I am not a fan of cars. This should not be needed according to basic economic theory. 
However, I am not completely convinced that this is a black-and-white matter, considering externalities and other dumb governmental policies that lead to legacy infrastructure.

- During the days of the Soviet Union, for example, that country‚Äôs industries used more electricity than American industries used, even though Soviet industries produced a smaller amount of output than American industries produced. More steel, cement, and other resources used for producing a given output likewise resulted in less output in the Soviet Union than in countries such as Japan or Germany.

- During the era of the Soviet Union and Cold War competition, the Soviets used to boast of the fact that an average Soviet box car moved more freight per year than an average American box car.
