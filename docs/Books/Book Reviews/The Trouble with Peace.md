# The Trouble with Peace


# ðŸš€ The Book in 3 Sentences
Manipulation, rebellion, and weak characters. This book has a good way of describing a changing society and its interests and their manipulations. You can see how characters shaped by honor lose to those who will stop at nothing to gain power. 

# ðŸŽ¨ Impressions
