# A Field Guide to Lies


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is akin to calling bullshit, where it goes through all the ways people fool themselves and others. The book might make you too aware and skeptical of everything. 

# üé® Impressions
I found it good but not as good as [[Calling Bullshit]]. It was thought but lacked the examples that made Calling Bullshit such a good read. 

## How I Discovered It
Calling bullshit recommended it as well as I had read a book by the author before. 

## Who Should Read It?
Not sure. Depends on how interested you are in data. 

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
I feel like am becoming more and more of a cynic. In the mold of Camus, i try to reject this sarcastic and post-modern view of things and become a more positive person. So what if the world is filled with bullshit, lies, and half-truths.  It is still worth trying to belive more and still worth being positive about things.
