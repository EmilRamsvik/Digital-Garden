# Best served Cold


# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
The book is set in a different place than the first law, but a lot of the characters from the first law series are there and it is very much connected. It follows a mercenary woman and her quest for revenge. It is filled with betrayals. 

# 🎨 Impressions
I  found this book quite funny with good characters although the world-building left something to be desired. 

## How I Discovered It
Part of the first law world. 

## Who Should Read It?

People who like fantasy, and especially George RR Martin type fantasy.
