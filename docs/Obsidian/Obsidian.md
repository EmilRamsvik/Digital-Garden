# Obsidian
Obsidian is where I store my knowledge. I use it as a tool for writing, for storing information and knowledge, and for remembering. The main point of using obsidian is that it is living on your personal computer, can be treated as a good tool for writing quickly and also can be integrated with a lot of different tools, which probably is a huge advantage. 


## Pros and Cons
I think the best thing about Obisidian is it's ease customization. The second is how easy it is to store the files and share them. It's all markdown anyway, so it is not that big of a deal to fix them. 
I think Obisian is not good as a tool to share knowledge and to collaborate. It is meant to be a single-user tool. Furthermore, I find it less than useful too to write just plain text. 


# Plugins
| Plugin Name | Checked | Used | Comment |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) | Yes | Yes | Very cool, but not something one should start with. It is super powerful when you learn it, but it is only effective when you have gained some knowledge and skill using obsidian. I only started using it proactively after I had worked with Obisidain for about a year.  I use it for understanding what articlese I have not finished and what I can work more on. |  |

| calendar | No | No |  |  |
| table-editor-obsidian | No | No |  |  |
| [Periodic-notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) | Yes | Yes | This is a good add-on, I use it probably every day. |  |

# Thoughts 
- Obisidan is a powerful tool but is limited when it comes to collaboration, especially in larger teams. It is at its most powerful when you can easily create and enlarge your view and allow the plugins to enable you to improve your notetaking little by little.
