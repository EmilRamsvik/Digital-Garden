# Obsidian
Obsidian is where I store my knowledge. I use it as a tool for writing, for storing information and knowledge, and for remembering. The main point of using obsidian is that it is living on your personal computer, can be treated as a good tool for writing quickly and also can be integrated with a lot of different tools, which probably is a huge advantage. 


## Pros and Cons
I think the best thing about Obisidian is it's ease customization. The second is how easy it is to store the files and share them. It's all markdown anyway, so it is not that big of a deal to fix them. 
I think Obisian is not good as a tool to share knowledge and to collaborate. It is meant to be a single-user tool. Furthermore, I find it less than useful too to write just plain text. 

### Obsidian for the curious new user. 

Starting obsidian can be a bit difficult, where the amount of customization and possibilities make it difficult to grasp your head around. The advantage of obsidian, however, is that you don't need a lot of knowledge to get started.  My journey in obsidian started very simply and expanded. Here are some learnings from this journey. 

1. **Start with something simple and expand from th**ere. 
	   I started working mostly using the daily notes feature to create a small overview of things I wanted to do each day. From there on, I expanded and removed unnecessary items. Then, I started working more on a personal knowledge base.
2. **Experiment with Templates** 
	Templates are the natural next step in learning obsidian. By using templates, you can quickly determine what you need. 
3. **Make Obsidian a routine for your daily workflow.** 
	I combined Obisidian with my Alfred workflow to quickly jot down notes from the day or things I wanted to do. I work a lot on noting down thoughts and use these notes together with tags and some routines to expand. Combined with daily notes, I could quickly write down ideas or others and store them in the Obsidian Vault
4. **Get familiar with markdown.** 
	Learn the[ markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/); it will help you get started quickly. Also, get familiar with hotkeys in Obsidian to get quickly up and running.
5. **Enjoy and Explore**
	One of the coolest things in Obsidian is the plugins, templates, and workflows that can make your life easier and make Obisidan even more powerful. 

Remember, I would reiterate that Obsidian is an awesome tool for working by yourself, but it is not optimal when it comes to collaboration. I felt that sharing my notes, posts, and articles was usually difficult (So I made my own webpage to share with others quickly). 
It is also a bit of a challenge to get up and running, especially if you want to customize early. Copy-pasting templates might be useful, but there are usually some bugs or issues that will leave you debugging for a long time if you copy another person's template. Take it easy, make it a habit to jot down what you learn, and then add on as necessary. 


# Plugins
| Plugin Name | Checked | Used | Comment |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) | Yes | Yes | Very cool, but not something one should start with. It is super powerful when you learn it, but it is only effective when you have gained some knowledge and skill using obsidian. I only started using it proactively after I had worked with Obisidain for about a year.  I use it for understanding what articlese I have not finished and what I can work more on. |  |
| homepage | No | No |  |  |
| calendar | No | No |  |  |
| table-editor-obsidian | No | No |  |  |
| [Periodic-notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) | Yes | Yes | This is a good add-on, I use it probably every day. |  |
| obsidian-dice-roller | No | No |  |  |
| obsidian-dictionary-plugin | No | No |  |  |
| obsidian-kanban | No | No |  |  |
| obsidian-languagetool-plugin | No | No |  |  |
| obsidian-linter | No | No |  |  |
| [quickadd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) | Yes | Yes | Very very good plugin, must have. Makes it so much easier to add new articles based on templates or other. |  |

# Thoughts 
- Obsidian is a powerful tool but is limited in collaboration, especially in larger teams. It is at its most potent when you can easily create and enlarge your view and allow the plugins to enable you to improve your notetaking little by little. 
- It is not great as a collaboration tool, but the format with markdown files physically makes it hard to sync. And lack of oversight means that I would recommend other tools for working together. 
- Don't be afraid to reduce the templates to a bare minimum. It is easy to add new stuff but usually a harder exercise removing things. 
- Sometimes the upgrades make it difficult to fix stuff. I had a lot of issues when I made the web-pages. I had to make scripts to make a header at the front of each book review with the title to get the format right. 
- Embrace the fact that you will make a lot of changes, and don't let an imperfect start stop you from adding to the value.
