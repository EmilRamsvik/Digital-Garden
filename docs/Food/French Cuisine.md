# French Cuisine
My personal favorite in French cuisine is the [honey-glazed duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsIcy3F33CE&t=141s), the [Boef Bourguignon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCw_eR_iPA). 

Mastering French cuisine is one of the major achievements when it comes to cooking. Just understanding the sauces, methods, etc., makes you so much more capable of creating good food. It is not easy, but it should not be either.

# Thoughts 
- In a way, you gotta respect French cuisine; they torture food to make it taste better.
