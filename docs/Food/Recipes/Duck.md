# Duck
I think duck is one of the better ways of making haute cuisine food. And I very much prefer the french way of cooking duck. 


Duck, roates potatoes and Brocolini is one of my favourites. I use the apple sauce from the Marco Pierre White´s recipe as a sauce. Honey glazed duck is an all time favorite.
