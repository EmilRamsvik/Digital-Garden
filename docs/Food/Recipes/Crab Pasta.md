# Description
Venetian Seafood pasta is the perfect summer meal for a couple of people, and it is easy to make quickly. 

I watched Gino's Italian Escape and thought it was an interesting thing to look into. The appeal of prosecco and crab together in pasta was a nice little sneak peek.

# Thoughts
- Very summer type of dish
- Make sure to check whether or not the crabs are in season before you decide to make the dish.
