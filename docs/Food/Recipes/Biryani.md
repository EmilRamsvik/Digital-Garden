# Description
Biryani/Byriani is a Pakistani/Indian dish that is usually served at large gatherings. I did a lot of discovering and learning working with the guys in my apartment. 
I learned to make it during an exchange semester in Milano.
# Ingredients and Prep

* Basmati rice
* Tomatoes, usually the chopped tomatoes on a box, work fine. 
* Chicken or lamb. It can be used with different types and with whole legs. 
* *Optional* Eggs as a side. 
- Cooking oil
- Salt of course

I think having a good base for the sauce is good, and therefore, I recommend that chopped tomatoes be added to the sauce.

# Thoughts
- We used to do a lot of this together in Mlinao (My exchange roommates and I.)
- In Singapore, the rice was usually spiced up, and the sauce was added on the side. 
- Can use both Chicken and Mutton/lamb. Also, it is very easy to add large pieces of meat. 
- In Singapore, it was served with hard-boiled eggs and pappadums.  
- Very good together with Mango Lassi
- I like to add some of the biryani spice to the rice while it cooks in the water. 
- I will repeat ad nauseum: wash the rice. 
- Don't make it complicated; it is meant as a dish that should be easy to make. It is perfectly okay to make it with spice mix. 
- Spice mix is good, spice paste is not good in my experience. 
- Tried to experiment with coconut oil
