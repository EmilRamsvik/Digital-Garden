# Equipment
In this article, I list the most important tools I use in the kitchen.  My philosophy for tools can be found in the tools section [[Tools]]

## Chef´s Knife
I have one knife that I consider to be multi-purpose. Investing in a good chef's knife is some of the best investments an aspiring cook can make. 

## Iron Pan
I use an Iron pan for frying. This is a family inheritance that has been in the family for over 100 years (1911 is stamped on the pan). 

I found the methods for the maintenance of iron tools to be quite interesting. So-called [seasoning](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-season-cast-iron-pans-skillets-cookware). It seems like there is a large community on the internet dedicated to this. 


## Dutch Oven
The Dutch Oven is flexible and is usually a tool I use weekly, it has become a standard tool for stews and soups. 
## Spatula
A spatula that can withstand heat is awesome, it also makes you able to not waste food. Invest in spatulas that can resist heat up to 200 degrees Celsius and you should be fine. Also, I find being able to put them in the dishwasher makes you more likely to invest time to cook. 

## Kitchen towels. 
Chef Anthony Bourdain paid tribute to the side towel in _Kitchen Confidential_: _Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly_: “Side towels are hoarded like gold by good line cooks. When the linen order arrives, the smart cookies fall onto it voraciously, stashing stacks of valuable objects anywhere they can hide them. One cook I knew would load them above the acoustic tile in the ceiling, along with his favorite tongs. I’m sure that years later, though the restaurant has changed hands many times, future generations of cooks are still finding stashes of fluffy, clean side towels”

## Chopsticks
Chopsticks are actually quite useful tools for cooking, and in Asia and Asian cooking it is frequently applied instead of spatulas.
