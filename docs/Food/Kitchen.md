### Cutting techniques
Being skilled with knife work will make your life in the kitchen so much easier. Learn the basics of cutting and get a good knife. A good chefs knife is the most important tool in the kitchen.  

1. **Julienne:** This technique involves cutting food into long, thin strips, resembling matchsticks. Commonly used for vegetables like carrots, celery, or bell peppers, it's great for stir-fries or garnishes.

2. **Brunoise:** An extension of the julienne cut, brunoise involves first julienning the food and then dicing it into small cubes (about 1/8 inch). It's often used for aromatic vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery.

3. **Chiffonade:** This technique is usually used for herbs or leafy vegetables. The leaves are stacked, rolled, and then sliced into thin ribbons. It's excellent for garnishes or adding herbs to dishes.

5. **Rangiri:** A Japanese cutting technique used particularly for vegetables, where the food is rolled a quarter between cuts to create irregular, angled pieces. This is often used in simmered dishes to help the pieces absorb flavors better.

6. **Mince:** Mincing is chopping food into very small pieces, smaller than a dice. This is often used for garlic, ginger, or herbs, where you want the flavor to be distributed throughout the dish.

7. **Batonnet:** Similar to julienne but slightly thicker and larger, batonnet cuts are like small sticks. This is often the starting point for dicing into cubes.

8. **Paysanne:** This involves cutting vegetables into thin, flat pieces. The shape can vary (round, square, triangular), but they are all uniformly thin. This is often used for layered dishes or stews.
