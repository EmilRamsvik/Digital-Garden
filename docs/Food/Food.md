# Cooking 

One of the most important and fun aspects of cooking is the ability to explore outside of a set recipe. This exploration phase is what makes cooks great. Here is a list of questions for the aspiring cook. 

- What is the purpose of each ingredient?
- What is the scientific background for each action you do? Why are you applying heat to the meat, what is the purpose? 
- What does each ingredient taste like? 
- How often do you taste the food while you work?
- Do you measure each ingredient? Why?

# Thoughts 
- Don't be afraid to go outside the recipes, especially when cooking, you will never be good if you never fail. 
- Focus on the fundamentals; one of my greatest advantages is that I am very fast at preparing ingredients and knife work. The disadvantage is that in order to be the greatest asset, 
- Being good at knife work makes you seem like a pro. Very funny. 
- I have been to a couple of food cooking classes in my life, and usually, people ask me if I am a professional. This is, of course, because I look the part when prepping food. 
- I think the journey for me, and I truly believe that this is a good route to go is: 
	- In childhood and adolescence, you need to learn the principles and be allowed to fail and learn. How to cook things, how to prep things, and the value of understanding the ingredients and their purpose. 
	- When moving for yourself at university, gain confidence, and knowledge, and skill by making a lot of food cheaply and effectively. Meal prepping for me was very helpful. 
	- When getting a job with some income, you can focus on *haute cuisine*, mastering the advanced and complicated aspects of cooking.
