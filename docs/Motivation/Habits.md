# Habits
Habits are what you do automatically when a cue is triggered. There are two books on habit that I recommend. One is [Power of Habits](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/what-s-the-best-way-to-build-a-habit) by Charles Duhigg, and another is [Atomic Habits](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/what-s-the-best-way-to-build-a-habit) by James Clear. Both of those books are a good starting point. 

Habits are interesting, and they are a good way of disciplining yourself.

# Thoughts 
- When doing things, I have worked mostly on the small health and focus habits in the morning. It is much easier to "cue" in the morning than in the evening. 
- Bad habits are there for a reason; I think the removal of cues is important.  During the pandemic, I felt like it was too easy to grab a beer or something from the fridge, so I had to stop having beer in the fridge, then the monthly beer consumption fell drastically. *If there is honey in the jar the bear will eat it.*
