# Mathematics


## Fermats Last Theorem
The quest to determine if [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem), stated in the 1600s, was correct lasted 400 years and countless moments of frustration. The mathematician who discovered the proof took an obscene amount of time to discover it. [The book describing the problem and how many people were involved in the solution was very good. ](https://www.amazon.com/Fermats-Last-Theorem-Simon-Singh/dp/1841157910)

# Game Theory
*Winning starts with knowing what game you're playing.* Game theory is a fascinating concept, and the prisoner's dilemma is one of the most important "case studies. " Understanding mathematical optimal strategies is essential for understanding how the world works.

# Thoughts 
- I think not understanding mathematics is as much a choice as a skill. Everyone can become good at mathematics if they apply themselves.
