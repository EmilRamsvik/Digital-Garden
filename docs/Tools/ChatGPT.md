# OpenAI

# GPT-4
GPT-4 is one of the best tools I have used in the last couple of years. It is astonishing technology that makes me more productive. 

- It is important to have some validation of the output of LLMs, most of what you will get of output will seem reasonable but might be horrendously wrong. This makes it good for programming tasks as it is often easy to get feedback and validate. 
- The potential for LLMs is quite astonishing. See the [[NLP or LLM]] section for more.

# Thoughts 
- Standardizing the way you do prompts makes it a lot easier to get the results you want.
- Having snippets in [Alfred](../Mac/Alfred.md) for some standard prompts is something I have experienced a bit with. There are no definite conclusions, but it might be interesting to see the development. Having a defined format for the output would be interesting to see, so you only get the code, formatted data, etc.  Alfred also has an awesome workflow for interacting with OpenAI api. 
- I found recipe searching to be very interesting and fun. 
- ChatGPT is super handy when it comes to creating shell scripts. super easy to work with.
