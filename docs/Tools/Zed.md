# [Zed](https://zed.dev/)

Zed is an IDE. I liked it quite well as it has the following features that for me, are invaluable in an editor. 

- Git integrations 
- LLM support
- Vim support and customizable. 

I felt like a lot of the stuff with VS-Code made it a bit cumbersome, and I really wanted a bit more flexibility when it came to using LLMs and other tools. I want to use Claude and Mistral models as well as LLama open-source models.

# Thoughts 
- It is written in rust, so it must be good. 
- I quite like the minimalistic feeling of it. It is quite nice.
- I really like the easy vim keybinding which for me is quite important.
