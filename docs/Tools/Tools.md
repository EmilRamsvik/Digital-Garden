# Tools
Tools are the things I use to accomplish tasks. A tool can both be a requirement and a supplement to myself. 

I want tools that are
1. **Versatile**
2. **Flexible**
3. **Robust**
What do I mean by these criteria? It means that I want to be surrounded by solid tools that I use often and well. 

There should be an exponential relationship between the time you spend using the tool and the quality of your tool. What you use every day should be prioritized. As an example, if you spend 8 hours of your day on a computer, you should have the very best quality of hardware. 

Tools that make sure you are keeping yourself sharp and healthy should never be compromised. Using sub-optimal desks and chairs when working or studying is asinine 



## Bose Q35ii Headphones
This is probably one of my best investments. The headphones cancel out all background noise, and combined with music of white noise it almost completely blocks out noise. 

The only issue I have ever experienced is sometimes if you have paired the headphones with multiple devices it might be a bit confusing. 

The headphone leather wrappings might get a bit worn out and might even break, however, they are easily replaced and are quite cheap. 
I have heard stories of it failing, but I believe that might be due to too harsh use, using it outside in the rain etc. 


## Garmin Forerunner 245

I found the forerunner to be a good investment, mainly because it makes it easier for me to work out and serves as an external motivating factor. Tracking progress is fun, and it provides a lot of helpful functionality that I missed when I did not use a watch. 

I have the music version but don't really find it that useful. 

Funnily enough, it is the watch that really helped me ditch the phone and music/podcasts when running. I think this is a super nice thing to have and recommend it.  It is very nice to record the runs you do and have them in Strava. 


## Kindle 
The Kindle enables me to access the books I want to read immediately for a cheap price. It also serves as a good way of highlighting. This makes my book reviews ([[../Books/Booklist 2023]]) more thorough and I can go back to my book review and read the things I found interesting. 

Using the Kindle also enabled me to quickly get new books and it is very convenient, does not use that much power and is quite durable.  I usually borrowed books from the local library and wrote my thoughts in a notepad. I think I still want to do this with books that I don't highlight too much in, such as classical literature.  Furthmore, the advantage of a Kindle is that you can only do one thing with it, thereby minimizing distractions. 

The Kindle is an improvement over traditional books for two reasons. 
1. You get a lot more books available to you, bringing that amount of books with me would be detrimental. 
2. You can easily access the notes or "highlights", this makes the book notes and reviews much easier and it is possible to go back to review them later, thereby minimizing the need for rereading. 
The disadvantages are:
1. You need to be certain of battery is sufficient. This has not been an issue at all for me but sometimes it is a requirement to charge.
2. You dont get the book reading feeling. 

# Kitchen Tools
Tools I use for the kitchen are in the [[Equipment]] section. 

## [[Mac]]
I have a Mac for both personal use and work. I find it to be an extremely good investment and vastly superior to Windows machines. More info on the Mac and usage can be found in the [[Mac]] section. 


## [[Iphone]]
I use Iphone as my smartphone of choice. It is a good option and the user-friendlyness is awesome. I especially like how the compatbility with mac is great. 
The apps I use with Iphone can be found in the [[Apps]] section.
