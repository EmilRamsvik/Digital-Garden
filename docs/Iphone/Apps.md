## Streaks
 
I use streaks to measure my daily and weekly routines. I think it is an okay app, and I like the statistics. It can also be quite useful as a motivational piece. I find that the daily habits I usually have good "streaks" on are those I do at the beginning of the day. 
Most of the negative streaks have been useful as well. I feel most of the week's type of streaks are mostly to get an understanding of how I am doing, nice for recording things. 


## Day One

Day One is a journaling application. I try to use it as a small reminder and a recap of the last day. It is smart to have some small 
I also use it to record the number of daily push-ups I do. 

## DrinkControl
I use the DrinkControl app to register the number of drinks I have and the amount of money I spend on them. I use this to be more aware of the number of drinks I consume, which really helps limit my consumption. Also, it is a good reminder about the amount of money I spend. 
It also has integrations with Apple Health which are quite useful. 

## Tody
Tody is a nice app that is used to maintain a schedule for cleaning and organizing. I found it to be a good reminder app for household chores and what they imply.
