# Apps
I try to limit the applications and moreover, I limit the notifications. The apps are business and want your money or attention. Make the apps work for you, not the other way around. 


## Streaks
 
I use streaks to measure my daily and weekly routines. I think it is an okay app, and I like the statistics. It can also be quite useful as a motivational piece. I find that the daily habits I usually have good "streaks" on are those I do at the beginning of the day. 
Most of the negative streaks have been useful as well. I feel most of the week's type of streaks are mostly to get an understanding of how I am doing, nice for recording things. 


## Day One

*Day One* is a journaling application. I try to use it as a small reminder and a recap of the last day. It is smart to have some small 
I also use it to record the number of daily push-ups I do. 
I have a daily note that I like, and I think, to be honest, I am not using that well. I probably could expand this to use it more concisely and expand the journaling. It has a paid tier, but I'm not exactly sure if I even want to. 
## DrinkControl
I use the *DrinkControl* app to register the number of drinks I have and the amount of money I spend on them. I use this to be more aware of the number of drinks I consume, which really helps limit my consumption. Also, it is a good reminder about the amount of money I spend. 
It also has integrations with Apple Health, which are pretty useful. 

## Tody
*Tody* is a nice app that is used to maintain a schedule for cleaning and organizing. I found it to be a good reminder app for household chores and what they imply. 

## Keeper
Keeper is the app I use to store my passwords; I find it to be a tremendously helpful tool and am very happy about it.  It costs a lot of money, but I think that not worrying enough about getting hacked is worth it. Just having a randomly generated password that is unique basically makes you unhackable. My most critical passwords are for Keeper and my personal bank-access identification (Norway has something called BankID). Those two I never share with anyone.
