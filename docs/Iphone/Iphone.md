# Iphone
I switched from android to Iphone in 2017, and have generally been very impressed by it and liked quite well the phone. The only major issues I have had with the iPhone are either after prolonged use (years) or that the screen might be too big.
I think that the iPhone is a very good investment, along with the millions of others that made Apple one of the largest companies on the globe. 

I have generally been disappointed by Siri(The voice assistant); there are improvements to be made there for sure. I mainly use the voice assistant to ask to call someone.
