# Javascript
Javascript is the most popular language in the world, so you should at least have some knowledge of how it works and how it functions. 


## React




### Extensions of TypeScript
 .tsx and .ts files are both used in TypeScript projects, but they have a key difference. .tsx files are designed to work seamlessly with JSX â€“ a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like structures within your React components. In contrast, .ts files are for standard TypeScript code and don't natively support JSX. If you're building React components, you'll typically use .tsx files; for other TypeScript code like utility functions or data models, you'll use .ts files. The same applies to .jsx files.
