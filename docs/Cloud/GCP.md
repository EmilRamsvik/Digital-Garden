# GCP



# Firebase
Firebase and Flutter is a very cool combo. It has great material on how to work with and helpful docs. It makes creating a simple crud app in Flutter super easy. 
Firebase has authentication, databases, cloud functions, and a lot of features that make it an ideal service for projects. 

- [Firebase for Flutter Introduction](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/)
- [Auth for Flutter with Firebase](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/auth/start/)

Firebase however, is a properity service and it will be a pain to migrate out. But Google said it wont be evil.
