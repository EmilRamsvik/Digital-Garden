## Virtual Networks 
A Virtual Network, often abbreviated as VNet, is a logically isolated network within a cloud computing environment or within your own on-premises datacenter. It enables you to control your own private space within the cloud, essentially acting as a slice of the cloud's overall network that you control.

#### Things to know: 
**DNS**: DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's essentially the "phone book" of the internet, translating human-friendly domain names like `www.google.com` into IP addresses like `172.217.22.14` that computers use to identify each other on the network.
**Cache**: a cache is a high-speed, temporary storage layer that stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature so that future requests for that data are served up faster than by accessing the data's primary storage location.
