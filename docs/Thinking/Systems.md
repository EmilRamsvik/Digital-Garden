# Systems
Systems are what we have around us, and instead of focusing on the thing itself, is about how things interact with other things. I got introduced to thinking in systems from the book [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md) and I have tried to explore those topics more in detail later. 

Understanding systems is a tremendous advantage when it comes to understanding the world. This is especially true for social systems such as organizations, businesses, and other human social structures. 

## Systematics
The term _**systemantics**_ is a commentary on prior work by [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski") called [general semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics "General semantics") , which conjectured that all systems failures could be attributed to a single root cause – a failure to communicate.
1. Everything is a system.
2. Everything is part of a larger system.
3. The universe is infinitely systematized, both upward (larger systems) and downward (smaller systems).
4. All systems are infinitely complex.

## Reading list for System Thinkers
First, i think the best way to start is the book [Systematics](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Systematics.md), as it is short and concise and really hammers down the point of system thinking. Then, I think a deeper exercise would be to take on [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md), as it is more technical in nature and explains the core concepts well. After that, reading [The Fifth Discipline](../Books/Book%20Reviews/The%20Fifth%20Discipline.md) is a nice follow up, where the focus is more on the organization in the system thinking context.

# Thoughts 
- I would like to be better at system thinking, but I lack the experience and training. How to get this training?
