# Systems
Systems are what we have around us, and instead of focusing on the thing itself, is about how things interact with other things. I got introduced to thinking in systems from the book [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md) and I have tried to explore those topics more in detail later. 

Understanding systems is a tremendous advantage when it comes to understanding the world. This is especially true for social systems such as organizations, businesses, and other human social structures. 

## Systematics
The term _**systemantics**_ is a commentary on prior work by [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski") called [general semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics "General semantics") which conjectured that all systems failures could be attributed to a single root cause – a failure to communicate.
1. Everything is a system.
2. Everything is part of a larger system.
3. The universe is infinitely systematized, both upward (larger systems) and downward (smaller systems).
4. All systems are infinitely complex.
