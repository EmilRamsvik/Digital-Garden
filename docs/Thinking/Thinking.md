# Thinking
Here, I write about ways of thinking about the world and the whys and hows. I am fascinated by how we as a species behave and act and how we can improve as a species.

## Friction in Organisations 
- Organization and processes incur friction slowly.
-  Friction is an inevitable outcome of company growth, which we can control. But is increased by the normalization of deviance, which we can control.
# Thoughts 
- Normalization of deviance example can be shown in the Challenger Space Shuttle Accident, which was coined in the accident investigation. 
- You cannot predict the future, but you can train yourself for it. 
- Everyone on this earth is at the core stupid. That includes both the reader and writer of this section. Make sure that you always take this simple fact into account. 
- People judge themselves on their intents, but others on their actions.
