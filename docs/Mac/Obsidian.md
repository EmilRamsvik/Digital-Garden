# Obsidian

Obsidian is the tool I use for storing information and writing down the experiences and knowledge I accumulate. 

I strive to write something in Obisidian every day, following my [[Personal#Workflow]] where I strive to create, update and enhance at least once.  


## Daily notes
I use obsidian daily notes to describe my day, and how I feel, and create a TODO list for today. 
I use the workflow for Obsidian ([[Alfred#Alfred Workflows]]) in Alfred to capture my workday and small notes to myself. It is also used as a way for me to remember small things and recap my day. 
At the end of the day, I write a review of the day and score the mood, productivity, and overall score for the day.  The score is between 1 and 10 and is meant to follow a normal distribution, with 5 being a completely average day. The review is helpful to me as I can use it to unwind and look back and reflect on what I did well and what could be improved. 

I find the daily notes to be a helpful and interesting way for me to structure my day, by setting aside time to write down what I have to focus on that day, I  prioritize the day and set a clear goal and structure. 

## Weekly review
Every Sunday, I try to write down a recap of the week, how the week has been and what I have improved on, and what I need to improve for next week. I also create a weekly goal list that should reflect what I wish to accomplish the next week. 

## Plugins
[QuickAdd](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/) This is mostly for plugging in templates, I have not experimented a lot with either capture or macros. I like the ability to quickly create notes based on predetermined templates and paths. 
[Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) are Useful for my weekly and monthly reviews. 
Dataview: Good for getting an overview when you have a large knowledge base.

# Thoughts 
- I find the daily and weekly notes to be quite good at making me more focused on the tasks. The daily works more as a journal with some tasks, while the weekly serves as a reminder and review of where I am meant to be. 
- I feel like the more I work in Obsidian, the more I try to simplify and focus on the text above other things. 
- Tags are cool, I try to add as many as possible.
