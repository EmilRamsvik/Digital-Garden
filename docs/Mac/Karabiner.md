# Karabiner
Karabiner is a powerful and customizable keyboard remapping tool designed specifically for macOS. It allows users to modify the behavior of their keyboards by remapping keys, creating shortcuts, and implementing various keyboard modifications. With Karabiner, users can redefine keys to perform different functions or assign complex combinations of keys to trigger specific actions. This enables users to personalize their keyboard layout and streamline their workflow, making it easier and more efficient to navigate through applications and perform tasks.

## Goku
[Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) is a way of configuring the keyboard using the ```karabiner.edn``` config. It is nice once you get the hang of it. 
- I kinda wish there was a way of doing the configs on a YAML format instead, I just had a feeling that this would be easier. 
- It took me a while to use Goku and the ```karabiner.edn``` file properly, I think a big mistake was to copy the entire contents of other people, as then it became a big mess. 
- A good way is to start with a simple keybinding, such as caps-lock, and then expand gradually.

# Thoughts 
- I find it quite hard to understand in a layer how you most effectively can map some commands ¨
- Search [GitHub]( [https://github.com/search?l=&q=filename%3Akarabiner.edn&type=Code](https://github.com/search?l=&q=filename%3Akarabiner.edn&type=Code)) for karabiner.edn inspiration.
