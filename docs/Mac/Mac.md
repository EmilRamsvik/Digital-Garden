# Mac
I switched from Windows to Mac in 2021 and used it privately until 2022 when I switched to a Mac for work as well. 

I consider the switch one of the best technical career moves I have ever made. 




## Apps

### [Tomatobar](https://github.com/ivoronin/TomatoBar)

A simple toolbar for doing the Pomodoro technique. Kinda neat. 

### [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
Rectangle is for window management, I use it together with [Karabiner](Karabiner.md) to resize and set up window management quickly. I have about 3 or 4 different hotkeys for this. 

### [Bear](https://bear.app/)
Bear is a markdown editor. 
It is nice to have as an alternative to [Obsidian](Obsidian.md), and one of the reasons I quite like it is because it is easy for me to just have it and only it as a writing tool. It is on a freemium plan and to be honest the feature i was looking for, the ability to export to .pdf formats is quite bad.
