# Business

I thought that this section would be more tailor-made to understanding how businesses work and more related to external views on business. Aka, you do not work there.

# Thoughts 
- Shadow work, aka offloading work to your customers. A good example is moving from a call center to having your customers navigate help pages. The business is giving you the responsibility to find the answer yourself. The same can be said about ordering flights and understanding what you need to put into the system. 
- I think understanding businesses can sometimes be compared to understanding systems and institutions, especially for large companies.
