# Philosophy 



## System Building
"System building" in philosophy refers to the process of creating a comprehensive and coherent set of ideas or principles that explain various aspects of the world. It's like assembling a puzzle, where each idea or principle is a piece that fits together with others to form a complete picture of how we understand things like reality, knowledge, morality, and existence.

Karl Marx is considered the last system-building philosopher. 



## Denim Philosophy
Denim Philosophy is the term I gave to the layman's philosophy. It is the musings of Pirisig in [[../Books/Book Reviews/Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]], it is the thoughts of the stoics in a modern society.  It is the thoughts from a ride on a Harley across long landscapes.  It is the unbound and unrestricted philosophy of the blue-collar worker, with none of the academic riddles and rules.  It is the philosophy of experience and experimentation. 


## Active Externalism 
Since the publication of Clark and Chalmers (1998), “active externalism” has been a hotly debated issue. Defenders of active externalism hold 
1) Cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain and body. 
2) Cognitive states can be partly constituted by non-biological, environmental objects and processes. 
The basic claim is that it is through our active engagement with bodily external elements that certain cognitive processes and states are made possible. As a consequence, cognitive processes and states can be partly constituted by features of the world around us. [Link](https://philarchive.org/archive/VICWIL)
[The extended mind thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis) - The mind is not exclusively in the brain or even the body, but extends into the physical world.
