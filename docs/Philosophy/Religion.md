## Religion: A Resilient Concept

Religion is a strong idea that has stood the test of time because it serves a purpose. Even the unusual practices in various religions were usually created with good reasons in mind.

## Changes Over Time

However, as time passes and things change, these reasons may no longer apply or be relevant today.

## Comparing Religion and Politics

Interestingly, I believe that rigid political ideologies bear a lot of similarities to religions. They exhibit similar patterns and behaviors. The cult of the leader is an interesting concept, and also maybe displays the weakness of atheist ideologies. At least the god is not increasingly becoming more and more totalitarian, at least it is usually an interesting aspect to it.

# Thoughts 
- There has been made one movie about the life of the Prophet Mohammad, which was filmed from the perspective of his uncle Abu Talib. 
- The reason Mohammad is not to be shown is to avoid idolization. Instead, he is meant to be known for his message.
