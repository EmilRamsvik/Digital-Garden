# On The Duality of Rights and Responsibilities

Rights are made by and for humans, and can by definition therefore also be taken away from them. We create rights by fighting, bleeding and dying for them to be made and upheld. This is true for all major events where mankind has lept from darkness and abuse to a tiny bit lighter society.  By having rights, you in turn have to accept the responsibility of upholding those rights for yourself and also others. 

No rights have come for free, there is a human condition of having no rights whatsoever, but it is an absolute limit. Your rights are not there for you to enjoy them, as fruits of other's labours, you must continually work and strive to uphold them. As fleeting as a feather down a stream, they can be seen, forgotten and in the end float away.  

It is in nature to forget, to break down and float away, as well as in the collective society of humans. In our own way, we usually, unbeknownst to ourselves, create models of nature in our social structures. These models follow some of the same drivers as in nature. This means that memes or cultural DNA follow a competing nature similar to its natural 
Rights can be seen as memes with fleeting relevance in our collective consciousness. Irrelevant rights will be forgotten and discarded, as extinction claims species that cannot muster the necessary resources to continue their lineage. 

Therefore, you should think of the responsibility of preserving your rights as putting effort and energy into maintaining the status and validity of those rights, either as applied to you or your fellows. By forgoing the responsibility of maintaining those rights you deem irreplaceable, you are slowly but surely contributing to their demise.

- Some of the thoughts here were inspired by Karl Popper's work in The Open Society and its Enemies. 
- I think you can learn a lot by comparison of human societies to nature, but one must be vary of not mistaking a model for the real thing. 
- Rights are inherently a social construct.
