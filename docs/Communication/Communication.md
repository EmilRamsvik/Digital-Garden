# Communication
Here, I write about communication and the topics around it. Communication is one of the most essential skills to have, and even though I struggle a lot with this, I want to improve considerably and become a skilled communicator. 





## Think Faster, Talk Smarter
These are techniques for understanding how to talk more easily in spontaneous situations; most of the information I got from the talk is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6TsR3y5Qfg). The speaker also wrote a book on this particular topic.  [He also has a podcast on the subject](https://open.spotify.com/show/6ll0MwobDt1JW9gYaOONEo?si=2fc132152e2b4a9f).

### Methodology
#### Tame the anxiety beast.
- Take a deep breath. Exhale, this is important. Try to exhale twice as long as you inhale.
- Drink water and chew gum beforehand. To make it easier to cope with the feelings and reactions of stress.
- Get present-oriented. Don't think ahead; think now.
#### Maximise mediocrity
- We are the biggest impediment to our spontaneous speaking.
- Reduce the cognitive load on yourself.
- Allow yourself to do that thing and not the right thing.
	- Give the answer, not the correct answer. 
	- Give feedback, not the best feedback.
#### Don't do something, stand there.
- It is very important to listen and listen deeply.
- What's the crux of the speaker's intent? What is the speaker trying to tell you?
- [Collin Dobbs on listening](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/space-pace-grace-how-handle-challenging-conversations)
	- Pace, slow things down 
	- Space, move yourself into a good position to get yourself comfortable with listening. 
	- Grace, listen to your intuition.
*You need to listen to your sweat.* Listening is an exercise and you need to train it. 
- Paraphrasing helps you listenâ€”work on always being good at doing this. After all, conversations, tell what you learned or heard. 
#### Structure your spontaneity. 
- Never lose your listeners.
Structure proposal:
- **What?** Is your idea, product, or feedback?
- **So what?** Why is it important to the listener?
- **Now what!** It is the action. Planning your next meeting, take the feedback. 
Using this structure can help you prioritize what to say and package your information in a way that is more likely to be understood and remembered by the listener.
#### Focus
*Tell me the time, don't build me a clock.*
Have a goal for the conversation, know, feel, do. 
Make a structure around the topic, an example can be answering/completing the following sentence
- What if you could ... 
- So that ...
- For example ...
- And that is not all ...
