# ðŸš€  The show in 3 Sentences
This show is about the sixties, and how people acted and behaved at the time. It is an interesting deep dive into the thoughts and attitudes at the time. It is also a deep dive into the changes happening at that time.

# ðŸŽ¨ Impressions
I quite liked it as an entry point into that age, and I think a lot of the more interesting things captured in the show are that the show-makers made a lot of good effort into producing believable characters and showing how people thought and acted at that time. It is also interesting to see how people reacted to large world-shaking events in their own way.
