# ðŸš€  The show in 3 Sentences
This show is not a typical cop show. The Wire is a show that looks at the war on drugs and the horrific consequences of it.  It is a show about people and institutions and how they relate to each other.

# ðŸŽ¨ Impressions
The Wire demands and rewards your attention.  There are no bad guys or good guys, everyone has their own agenda and framework. 

## Most important scenes


## Quotes
