# Personal

My Knowledge Wiki contains most of my knowledge (From 2023 onwards mostly). I try to gather all information I find interesting and my learnings in this wiki. The goal is to create a digital garden for my thoughts and share as much as possible of the things I find interesting. The goal is to have a comprehensive library for my thoughts and experiences that I can share with the world and look back on.  

I use [[Personal/Obsidian/Obsidian|Obsidian]] for most of the digital garden work I have, but it is not only for digital gardening but also for other things. It is an important part of the digital garden workflow. 

# Methodology
I believe consistent work and updates are the keys to improvement. I am a fan of trying to make a quick standard with at least some structure that can be expanded upon when making new choices. 


I want to make daily updates as long as possible and have created some incentives to do this. 

- I have created a task in my [[Apps#Streaks]] app for adding entries to the digital garden. 
- I have a digital entry reminder so that I can fill in something I have learned during the day, only on weekdays. 
- I have a workflow where every day, I try to add something new I have learned and enhance or add to an existing article. 
### Workflow
I have designed this basic workflow for making a daily entry and continuously improving the digital garden. 
#### CAE
CAE stands for Create, Add, and Enhance and is a task list for daily entries. To work in the digital garden, I use the term *item* to designate a standalone piece of text. An item should either be an article or a header with some text following it and should be an intelligent and clear piece of text that can be understood separately from other texts. 
- *Create* is that I want to create a new item in my knowledge hub. An Item is either a header or a new article. The goal is always to add new things to the garden. 
	- I do this by having a learning section in my daily note, where the purpose is to write down a paragraph about something new I learned that day. This enables me to easily create new sections or ittems. 
- *Add* is when I want to add something to an existing item. It can be a sentence or thought. The goal is to improve all items. If no particular things have been added, then going through the unfinished list is good. 
- *Enhance* is that I should improve either a process or item during the daily entry. A process can be a script used in the digital garden sorting the entries or fixing the style of some articles to the newest style. The goal is to improve the items in the digital garden continuously. The enhancement should be used on a different article than add. 
	- To add or enhance, I have a custom dataview script that takes entries i have not changed lately and picks out a random article which i can go into and either research something and add it or enhance the article. 
By using the CAE workflow, I can let the thought of always finishing things go and rather focus on writing for the fun of it. 

THe key to making this work is to automate as much as possible and make sure you are put in a position to succeed. Making reminders, creating scheduled tasks that pop up, or just noting down each time you do some entries or fix things help make it much easier to consistently work.

# Thoughts 
- I want to experiment with randomizing the daily entries, maybe creating a list of enhancements and articles I want to write about, themes, or others. 
- One particular fear I have is a lot of double entries, where I write the same thing over and over again. 
- Working on this one step at a time is quite fun, and reduces the stress of finishing up. 
- I want the digital garden to be a place where I enjoy writing and filling in. It should be a pleasant experience. 
-  I want to share this with the world, but only when it is large enough to be useful. 
- Articles that are not finished are not marked as finished in the header so that I can do some sort of differentiation between articles.  One thing I would like to do is work with [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and use it to create an unfinished table so that I can use that to finish up unfinished articles. 
- Obsidian has a lot of ways of publishing the notes, but it does cost a lot. 
- The more I work on my digital garden, the more I appreciate limiting the templates to the bare minimum. All my templates have gradually been made more concise and less obtuse. This makes it much more easy to write things in small batches. 
- Properties are awesome, but you should strive to keep them simple. However, do not despair, it is quite easy to make simple scripts to add properties to the YAML properties that you can use to update multiple files together. Also, here, the templater plugin and templates are your friends.
