# Design



## Atomic Design
Atomic design is a methodology for creating robust and scalable design systems. It breaks down user interfaces into smaller, reusable components called atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. These components can be combined and rearranged to build consistent and cohesive interfaces, making the design process more efficient and flexible.
- _Atoms_: Represent the basic building blocks of a design system (e.g., buttons, inputs).
- _Molecules_: Combine atoms to form more complex UI components (e.g., forms, cards).
- _Organisms_: These are groups of molecules working together to form distinct sections of an interface (e.g., headers, sidebars).
- _Templates_: Provide a layout structure for placing organisms on a page.
- _Pages_: These are specific instances of templates with actual content.

# User Experience UX


[Micromoments](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/how-micromoments-are-changing-rules/)
Very similar to the first-level thinking of Kahneman and Tversky. It seems to me, micro-moments are when habits have formed around decisions or acts. Applications should leverage these micro-moments in order to provide the needs of customers at these times. 

#### Edvard TufteÂ´s design principles
1. Above all else show the data.
2. Maximize the data-ink ratio.
3. Erase non-data-ink.
4. Erase redundant data-ink.
5. Revise and edit.

# Thoughts 
- The ratio of designers to developers should be low, especially if designers are not also taking on other roles.  1-5 is not an insufficient number here.
