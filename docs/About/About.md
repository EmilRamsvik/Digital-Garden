# About
I am a Data Scientist in my 30s, working mainly with programming and machine learning. I have worked primarily on private business. 

My passions are reading, learning programming, and solving problems. 



# Working
I started working as a trainee straight after school. It was a formative experience, and the learnings from the period shaped me and how I view many things. I got to appreciate the fact that working in business is more about people than tech. I also got the advantage of having good mentors and managers. I worked four and a half years in the maritime industry. I want to write more about the maritime industry and the challenges and opportunities that face it.
