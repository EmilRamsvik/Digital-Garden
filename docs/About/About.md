# About
I am a Data Scientist in my 30s, working mainly with programming and machine learning. I have worked primarily on private business. 

My passions are reading, learning programming, and solving problems. 


# Education
I received my Master of Science in Hydrodynamics in 2019. I studied at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/)). I studied at the Faculty of [Marine Technology.](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/msn1)  I mainly studied computational numerical mathematics, most of which was in a field called Computational Fluid Dynamics. I loved this field partly because I loved working on technical problems and because it was so hard. 
I remember being astonished when going into a master's degree in engineering and thinking about all of the fantastic tools and complicated mathematical tricks that I would learn and then ending up just using empirical formulas based on some experiments done 40 years ago. 

I wrote my master's thesis on simulating fluid flow directly; it was pretty complicated. I loved working on the master's thesis, primarily working on the code and simulation.  

# Working
I started working as a trainee straight after school. It was a formative experience, and the learnings from the period shaped me and how I view many things. I got to appreciate the fact that working in business is more about people than tech. I also got the advantage of having good mentors and managers. I worked four and a half years in the maritime industry. I want to write more about the maritime industry and the challenges and opportunities that face it.
