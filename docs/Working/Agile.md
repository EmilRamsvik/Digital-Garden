### Planning Poker
Planning poker in software development is a straightforward process where each team member independently estimates the effort needed for a project or task using numbered cards. They all reveal their estimates at the same time to avoid influencing each other. If estimates vary widely, they discuss why and may re-estimate to reach a consensus. This method helps understand the task better and ensures that the whole team agrees on the required effort.

# Thoughts 
- "Agile has become doing half of scrum shitty and using Jira" - Andy Hunt
- SAFe is the inevitable corruption of the Agile methodology.

Large ceremonies, hats instead of people, big estimations, and tracking. I do not know, but I think in order to understand what processes and frameworks can be implemented in a workload 
- Programmers are always saying you cannot make software as you do a car or a table, but why not? Are the complexities in writing code that much different from building a car? Anyways, the lean principles are derived from Toyota.
- Agile, is similar to *Aiguille* in French, which means needle.
