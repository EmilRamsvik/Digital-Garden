# Salary Negotiation

Two important things you need to do to get leverage
- Don't share information until you are ready to start negotiating.
- Get multiple offers. 
The ideal situation is to get all the offers at the same time. Time is more likely to kill a deal than money. Repeat: *Time is the killer of deals.*
#### Don't reveal any information.
- Don't ever name the first number.
	- There are a lot of advantages to being the last to act. 
	- They have all the information; you need to stack the cards in your favor.
	- What to say instead: "At this point, I don't feel equipped to throw out a number because I'd like to find out more about the opportunity first-right now I simply don't have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, **I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I also promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.**"
- Don't reveal any information about who else you're talking to or how far along you are in the job process at other places.  
	A good line: *I am talking to a few companies, at various stages. Nothing is finalized; I will let you know before I make a few big decisions.* 
- Think of a recruiter as someone whose job is to collect information they can ONLY use against you.  (Think of Miranda Rights for recruiting)

#### What do you always need to get more? 
The reverse used car salesman: What to say always to get more. I have the following offers, and I'm still interviewing at a couple of companies, but I am really excited about this opportunity and will drop my other stuff and sign today if it's available. 
- Equity
- Salary
- Signing/relocation bonus. 
Overshoot: If you ask for what is fair, then you will get in the middle of the original offer and the fair one. 
#### Timing
Set Deadlines for each phase of the process upfront. 
Ask for extensions liberally. Recruiter deadlines and exploding offers are arbitrary. Most people are not proactive enough, control timing with a deterrent, and make themselves set the timelines. Tell them when you want the offers. 

### CounterOffer
*Thank you for your time and energy. I am excited about this opportunity because of its impact and growth. Let's work together to find a comp package that works for both sides. To be transparent, I am in the early stages of my job search. I just got another offer from another tech company. Would it be impossible to meaningfully increase the total comp?*

Might be smart to name a number instead of doing the open type of question. 

*Okay, you can't do what we asked for, but make me your most improved offer, and I'll give it my best consideration.*

# Thoughts 
- It would be smart to practice salary negotiation as well as interview techniques. 
- Always overshoot; no one will thank or reward you for being correct in your assumptions. 
- DO NOT TELL THEM YOUR SALARY EXPECTATIONS.
- It's your job to be pushy at the offer stage. 
- We do not want to share any actionable info too early (Time, Money, Contracts/Offers). It is like dating; you withhold information to gain a positive perception. 
- Be positive and helpful. 
- If they ask about your salary expectations, you want to have a good answer; I like Josh Doody´s example: “I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation,”
