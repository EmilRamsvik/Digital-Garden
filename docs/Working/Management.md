# Management
Here, I write about my management learnings, both good and bad. I have been quite fortunate to work with great managers, and this has inspired me to incorporate a lot of their wisdom into the way I work. 

## Manage to help

After being both in a position to manage and being managed in my career, I have noticed a reactive trend among managers.  I think this trend, where a lot of the development is being put on oneself might be self-defeating. I get it, the motivation and reasoning behind it is good, that the one responsible for their development is the one taking charge of it, and that might be on paper a good thing. It most certainly is in line with the current zeitgeist of the times. 

However, I think we are missing a crucial aspect of management, which is a manager, you are supposed to have a broader perspective. I for one, did not know that I had weaknesses within one or other segments and could work on new things. I think as a manager, it is important to guide those you are managing to become the best they can be. And to do that, you need to give input. You should take the responsibility to identify the areas where there is room for improvement, and if the person do not have a grasp of where they want to go (understandably), you need to show them how. 

As a manager, do not start personal development discussions as an open book, have a set of possible actions to take, and help the person identify the path, instead of letting them figure it out. They will eventually figure it out (I most certainly did), but why make it cumbersome.
