# Remote Work
I did some remote working when I was at Bali, working primarily on my side projects. I felt like it is very difficult to motivate oneself if one does not have a social society or connection. It was fun however to experience new places. 

One thing that should be noted is the problem regaridn helath and also related to health when working. Be carefulworking with bad tools that will make you unhealth or end up hurting yourself. 


## Alignment issues
I think one of the biggest issues with remote working and being a digital nomad is the fact that you are not able to align with other people in the organization and the team. 

The number of small issues that can be resolved with just a quick question is infinitely harder to ask in a remote setting. 


## Make Sure You are Comfortable at Home. 

One of the biggest improvements I had in home-office/remote working was actually taking a lot of time and effort to set up a functional and also well-functioning home office space to make sure I had everything I needed to be productive. 

[Your Brain at Work](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Your%20Brain%20at%20Work.md) says that a good thing for productivity is actually having quite a large screen, which also is good because it feels nice to have such a screen. 

When possible, I recommend having your own office space outside of your normal working spaces. It makes the change from work to normal life better. 

Also, I recommend getting out a bit when doing home office. Take a stroll through the park or something else.  Going outside makes going back to work easier. This also makes working together

# Thoughts 
- I feel like I often need some time to get into a groove when it comes to remote working, it is often that I need a day or two of unproductivity before I really get going.
