# Job Searching 


# Interview
The interview is about practice; if you want to get good at interviewing, you must practice. Interviewing is 90 % practice. 

The purpose of this practice is to focus on *how* to answer a question rather than *what* to answer. Let's break this down a bit. If you receive a question related to communicating with other departments, you should already know what to answer; you cannot invent an answer to this question on the spot; it should be clear what you should answer. The 'how' is dependent on the situation; it is situation-specific. This is where you need to focus your attention and energy. When you practice, you automatize the *what* and can concentrate on the *how*.

*Can you remember to smile when you don't know what you are going to say?*
## Tell Stories
Humans are storytelling people; we communicate by using stories. Therefore, a focus area should be creating good stories with a clear purpose. These stores are what you can base your answers on. 

Good frameworks for telling stories are [STAR](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/star-technique) and [CAR](https://thehiredguns.com/car-technique-secret-interviewing-weapon/)

# Resume
You should not use more than 4 hours on the resume. In [The Job Closer](../Books/Book%20Reviews/The%20Job%20Closer.md), the research highlights that the average time spent on a resume is measured in seconds, not minutes or hours, seconds. 
- A resume should be correct.
- A resume should show outcomes.
- A resume is looked at 


# Negotiation

Two important things you need to do to get leverage
- Don't share information until you are ready to start negotiating.
- Get multiple offers. 
The ideal situation is to get all the offers at the same time. Time is more likely to kill a deal than money. Repeat: *Time is the killer of deals.*
#### Don't reveal any information.
- Don't ever name the first number.
	- There are a lot of advantages to being the last to act. 
	- They have all the information; you need to stack the cards in your favor.
	- What to say instead: "At this point, I don't feel equipped to throw out a number because I'd like to find out more about the opportunity first-right now I simply don't have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, **I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I also promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.**"
- Don't reveal any information about who else you're talking to or how far along you are in the job process at other places.  
	A good line: *I am talking to a few companies, at various stages. Nothing is finalized; I will let you know before I make a few big decisions.* 
- Think of a recruiter as someone whose job is to collect information they can ONLY use against you.  (Think of Miranda Rights for recruiting)

#### What do you always need to get more? 
The reverse used car salesman: What to say to always get more. I have the following offers, and I'm still interviewing at a couple of companies, but I am really excited about this opportunity and will drop my other stuff and sign today if it's available. 
- Equity
- Salary
- Signing/relocation bonus. 
Overshoot, if you ask for what is fair, then we 
#### Timing
Set Deadlines for each phase of the process upfront. 
Ask for extensions liberally. Recruiter deadlines and exploding offers are arbitrary. Most people are not proactive enough, control timing with a deterrent, and make themselves set the timelines. Tell them when you want the offers. 

### CounterOffer
*Thank you for your time and energy. I am excited about this opportunity because of its impact and growth. Let's work together to find a comp package that works for both sides. To be transparent, I am in the early stages of my job search. I just got another offer from another tech company. Would it be impossible to meaningfully increase the total comp?*

Might be smart to name a number instead of doing the open type of question. 

*Okay, you can't do what we asked for, but make me your most improved offer, and I'll give it my best consideration.*

# Thoughts 
- A resume should be **clean** above all else. 
- Always overshoot; no one will thank or reward you for being correct in your assumptions. 
- DO NOT TELL THEM YOUR SALARY EXPECTATIONS.
- It's your job to be pushy at the offer stage. 
- We do not want to share any actionable info too early (Time, Money, Contracts/Offers). It is like dating; you withhold information to gain a positive perception. 
-  "**Competence Triggers:** basically, if you have to judge someone’s skill based on a series of brief interactions, you’re going to pattern match their behavior against other people who you like.  When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of _people like them_ who live and breathe this business thing.  They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company.  Volunteering a number when asked says the same thing to people with hiring authority that flunking FizzBuzz says to an engineer: this person may be a wonderful snowflake in other regards, but on the thing I care about, they’re catastrophically incompetent." - Patrick McKenzie
