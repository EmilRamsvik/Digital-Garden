# Job Searching 


# Interview
The interview is about practice; if you want to get good at interviewing, you must practice. Interviewing is 90 % practice. 

The purpose of this practice is to focus on *how* to answer a question rather than *what* to answer. Let's break this down a bit. If you receive a question related to communicating with other departments, you should already know what to answer; you cannot invent an answer to this question on the spot; it should be clear what you should answer. The 'how' is dependent on the situation; it is situation-specific. This is where you need to focus your attention and energy. When you practice, you automatize the *what* and can concentrate on the *how*.

*Can you remember to smile when you don't know what you are going to say?*
## Tell Stories
Humans are storytelling people; we communicate by using stories. Therefore, a focus area should be creating good stories with a clear purpose. These stores are what you can base your answers on. 

Good frameworks for telling stories are [STAR](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/star-technique) and [CAR](https://thehiredguns.com/car-technique-secret-interviewing-weapon/)
