# Consulting
I have worked as a consultant and would like to share the knowledge from that experience here. 

## Your job is to be helpful 
This is the most important aspect of consultancy. You are a large expenditure, and the ones paying are doing it for a reason. You need to understand that reason. If not, your client will not be pleased.  You should aim to have a lasting positive impact on your client. An investment in you as a consultant should be like an investment in a stock, it should pay dividends for a long time after the initial investment. 



### Onboarding
Onboarding is a critical phase of your engagement with clients.  Make sure that you have an onboarding plan as quickly as possible. Reach out to colleagues already in engagements to find insights and figure out the minutia of the company. 
A lot of the issues with getting an account, and getting access to materials and accounts often require steps or "hacks" that are not documented. To piggyback on your coworker's experience is invaluable here. 
Make sure to write down as much as possible during this phase, it will help immensely when you are going to help people onboard or you need to go through the steps again.

# Thoughts 
- As a consultant, make sure that you have the personal number and contact info of your stakeholders, and at least 3. If you have issues, need to get access to the building or are locked out of your computer, this might be a lifesaver. This has helped me on multiple occasions. 
- Use the network you have available to help you get aligned on the job as quickly as possible. You will get a lot of goodwill if you lessen the onboarding workload for the stakeholders. 
- Communication is everything.
