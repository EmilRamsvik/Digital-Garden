# Consulting
I have worked as a consultant and would like to share the knowledge from that experience here. 

## Your job is to be helpful 
This is the most important aspect of consultancy. You are a large expenditure, and the ones paying are doing it for a reason. You need to understand that reason. If not, your client will not be pleased.  You should aim to have a lasting positive impact at your client. An investment in you as a consultant should be like an investment in a stock, it should pay dividends for a long time after the intial investment.

- Use the network you have available to
