# Productivity Theory

### Gilb´s Law
*Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all. Programmers are fond of saying, “You can’t really measure that,” and Gilb’s law says that’s just a cop-out—it might be hard to measure, and the measurements might not be 100% accurate, but anything is better than nothing!*
This means that if you cannot measure something, it is not that you cannot measure it, but that you cannot measure it well. Knowing something is better than nothing.

	- Secondary effects of measuring. 
	- People deal badly with uncertainty.
