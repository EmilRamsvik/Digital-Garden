# The Garden

Welcome to my Digital Garden.  Here, I try to gather my personal knowledge and share it in the best way I know how. This not only helps me learn while working but is also a helpful place for me to gain knowledge and insights, as well as constantly review what I have done to improve each section. The garden might grow new branches, but adding more is not necessarily what I would like to accomplish, I would also like to prune and grow the branches I have. The growth, like in nature should be organic. 


The garden is by no means a finished work, even my publications of articles are somewhat sketchy, as I have often published unfinished articles that might even be a dummy. However, it is all part of the process of writing and discovering. It is a garden, not a building; it should let its ihabitants live and grow and die naturally. 

## [AI](AI/AI.md) 
I write a lot about AI, and these are my articles on AI.  [Data Science](AI/Data%20Science/Data%20Science.md) is a sub-phase that I think will be good to go through with later. 


## Tools and Methods

I like to try to understand more about [Productivity](Productivity/Productivity.md) and especially the [Theory Behind Productivity](Productivity/Productivity%20Theory.md). In the [Mac](Mac/Mac.md) and [iPhone](Iphone/Iphone.md) sections, I talk a little about the tools I use the most, their applications, and other tools in [Tools](Tools/Tools.md).  Of course, [Programming](Programming/Programming.md) contains much info on programming that I have worked on and learned. 
  
## Books

I read a lot, with 72 books read in 2021, 52 in 2022, and 84 books read in 2023. In 2023, I started using Kindle as my primary tool. And I also started using book reviews to read and understand more of what I actually read. The hope is that the book reviews, combined with going back to the book reviews and linking to other books, might make the reviews a more *living* thing that is constantly growing and evolving (In line with the general principles of the digital garden.)
### [Booklist 2023](Books/Booklist%202023.md)
List of books with their Book Reviews linked from 2023. 

### [Booklist 2024](Books/Booklist%202024.md)
Booklist from 2024: some of the books have not been read through yet; the books on the list are added as I discover them. 


## Other things
I write a little bit about [Mathematics](Mathematics/Mathematics.md) and some thoughts about [Thinking](Thinking/Thinking.md) and [Learning](Learning/Learning.md); I think the article on [Lectures](Learning/Lectures.md) contains a lot of good information as well.  [Travel](Travel/Travel.md) contains a little bit of information about where I have been and places I have traveled to. It might be a good guide sometimes for someone who goes to the same places.
