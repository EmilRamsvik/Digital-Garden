# Exercise

I try to exercise between 3 and 5 times a week. I try to separate between goals and expectations so that I can always reach for something hard to do. 
I think my high-level goal is to become an athlete. Meaning that I can excel in most things and is healthy and fit at all aspects. 

# Anaerobic Exercise


## [[Strength Training]]
I started with strength training as a 17-year-old, but only consistently started working out when I was 20. I have been more or less working out with strength training consistently until recently. 


# Aerobic Exercise

For aerobic exercise, I have mostly kept myself to running. But I have not run consistently for large parts of my life (10 years out of 20 with running as a realistic activity).
