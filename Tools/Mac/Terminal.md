#  [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) 
I started using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) in May 2022, and it quickly became my terminal of choice. I find the most difficult thing when it comes to using the terminal is that it is often difficult to remember commands even thou I "know" what I want to do. Warp is amazing at solving this gap by using AI capabilities and natural language to make doing terminal tasks easier. 

[Warp-AI Is good for debugging and understanding code more.](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-ai)
[I use AI Command Search with natural language if I don't specifically know what to do](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-ai/ai-command-search)
