# Streaks
#productivity #habits #iphone #apps 
I use streaks to measure my daily and weekly routines. I think it is an okay app, and I like the statistics. It can also be quite useful as a motivational piece. I find that the daily habits that I have good "streaks" on usually are the ones I do at the beginning of the day. 
Most of the negative streaks have been useful as well. I feel most of the week type of streaks are mostly to get an understanding of how I am doing, nice for recording things.
