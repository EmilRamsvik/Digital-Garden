# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about dating for men. But it is an honest book, that says that you should start with yourself and become a person people likes and you are comfortable with. Real men are vulnerable and in charge of their feelings.

# 🎨 Impressions
It was a good book to read, in the sence that it is a book about dating that is allgined with my values and how I would like to live my life. It was mostly nice to read about the same values I want to embrace. I did not like the sexual parts that much, as they were a bit conflicting with my values. As asking for permissions to do sex is considered to be a bit of a turn off, but for me it is important that this is clear and understandable for everyone.

## Who Should Read It?

I think men who have read to much pick up artists should take this book to heart. 
# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
I personally felt thsat this book enabled me to become more focused on myself when I do my dating activties. I felt like it was a good companion when it comes to the being vulnerable and not carign to much about rejection. I think the moments I have felt hurt have been because I was vulnerable and set myself up to be disappointed.

Also, I think that it should not be a bad thing to approach women outside apps and stuff. When I return to Norway I will focus on this. 

Real men are in connection with their feelings, they are not assholes, nor are they simps.

- *I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence.

- *Trying to sabotage a woman’s relationship so you can swoop in and “steal” her is not only ineffectual but morally fucked up. It’s neediness and narcissism to an extreme degree.*

Often they’re nothing more than excuses — ways for us to avoid the blame and responsibility for not being satisfied with our results.*
