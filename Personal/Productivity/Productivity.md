# Productivity
I am fascinated by productivity and am always looking for ways to increase my productivity. As I am only one person, it is important that I to the greatest extent possible maximize the amount of work I can do. 

One of the most things you can do to maximize your productivity is to understand how you learn most efficiently and from then on make sure to put yourself in a good opportunity to learn. 

I personally believe that learning is best when you can continuously bounce back and forth ideas with peers or tutors. My greatest learning moments have been in such situations.

# Thoughts 
- I liked the book[ Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by Cal Newport on deep work. See the [Lex Fridman podcast](https://youtu.be/y3Umo_jd5AA) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6yLQbMhr1r6SYIsKj1LO5P?si=dfbc8d2f85384484))with him as well for a more condensed version. 
- Never accept a position or role where you do not have the opportunity to discuss with peers or experts.
