# Dart 
Dart is a wonderful language that is to my knowledge completely null-safe. 

# Flutter

Flutter is a framework for developing cross-platform applications. It is built upon the Dart language. 
Flutter is supported by Google.

# Thoughts 
- Flutter introduced me to the trials of state, which when I started became one of the hardest things to understand and work with. 
- Knowing all the widgets in flutter is not the most important thing, rather understand the flow of data is important.
