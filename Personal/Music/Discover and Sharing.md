I try to expand my musical horizon as much as possible. So that I can have music for all my moods and situations. Most of all the music I discover is either through spotify or youtube, but sometimes I tinhk that the best experiences are going to a festival or concert and get introduced to new artists. 

I love sharing things that I discover, and I belive that sharing things that interest me is of great importance for building relationships. 

I send out almost weekly songs to people who I am close to and want to share what I have discovered with people. I mostly due it to share and show that I care by giving a small music sample every friday.
