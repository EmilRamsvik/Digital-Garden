# Music


##  Spotify
I primarily use Spotify to listen to songs and podcasts. It is my primary tool for music. I quite like their ways of adding 

## Youtube
Youtube is mostly for music that is not available on Spotify, mainly because of copyrights or others. Most of the music I have is either remixes or covers or live performances. Also, I like to have some live sets in the background when I work or do other stuff. 
### Good Live sets
- [Parcels Live Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePSivyATBqg) From La Cigale, Paris. Very good sound quality. 


#### Brown Noise
I use the Spotify playlist for[ brown noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4hpot8sYudB?si=a04799a8bddb496e) when I am in a concentrated state. 



# Links
- [Yale Listening to Music Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_yOVARO2Oc&list=PLh9mgdi4rNezhx8YiGIV8I22ICSuzslja) Interesting if you like to listen to classical music.
