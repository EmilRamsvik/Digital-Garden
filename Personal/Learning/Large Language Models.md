# GPT-4
GPT-4 is one of the best tools I have used in the last couple of years. It is astonishing technology that makes me more productive. 

- It is important to have some validation of the output of LLMs, most of what you will get of output will seem reasonable but might be horrendously wrong. This makes it good for programming tasks as it is often easy to get feedback and validate.
