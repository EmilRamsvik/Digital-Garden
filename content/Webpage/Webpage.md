# Webpage
I made a static web page to share my thoughts and the knowledge I have acquired. I wanted a place to share what I had learned with the wider world. Secondly, it was more of a learning experience creating and maintaining the web page over time. 

### Obsidian
My go-to knowledge-gathering and note-taking app is [Obsidian](../Obsidian/Obsidian.md). Obsidian lets me quickly gather notes in a structured format and have standard methods for linking notes together, having tags, and a more structured way of learning. 
A big issue is structuring migrations from obsidian to the github. For me, it was a bit more of difficult setting to migrate the data from one place to another. Furthermore, 

# Quartz

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) Is the new method for exposing my notes to the world. I discovered via obsidian and this [Youtube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw&t=34s&ab_channel=NicolevanderHoeven)

I choose to migrate because the following reasons:
1. Less overhead and complications as it is made for Obsidian.
2. More build in functionality that I struggled with implementing in old framework (Search, Recent changes etc.)
3. Docusaurus (Old Framework) was old and not that much used. 
4. The old site kept breaking down, not fun. I had to fix it regardless. 


### Migrating From Docusaurus to Quartz

 Actually, moving from DocuService to Quartz was a pretty straightforward thing. I think I primarily spent most of my time in the command line using a lot of LLMs to help facilitate the migration. 
 
 I think most of the issues were probably just related to removing files, making sure that all the small configs were set up in place. One of the best things with this is that it was so easy for me to let go of all the stress of a major rewrite, just delete and move on. Just skrew it, delete everything, put it back together and then I'll deal with the augumentations when I have time. 

# Old Frameworks
## Docusaurus
Docusaurus is a library based on the React framework and is used to display the page. One advantage of docusaurus is that I can work in obsidian and then migrate those to the repo with the code. I can also separate the different pages that are personal and those that I would like to share. 
Also, Docusaurus enables me to learn more about JavaScript and development in React.  I found it very easy to deploy and make the web page, making it much more rewarding to work on development.  ¨

### Random Page
I want to write a little bit about the random page funcitonaliyty i impolemented in docusaurus. I think this is a good thing to write about becuase it highlights some of the struggles of a developer. 

I started with making a prompt for creating a docusaurus random page, and after the message from the LLM was kind of vague I did a little bit of research into the topic. 

I use react for creating components and therefore it seemed like a good choice to look a bit into how a react component was made. However, it seemed to be quite difficult for me to use the lists dynaimcally, and I decided to create a list of articles using a bash shell script for creating the articles list and then reference that one in react. Kind of a hazzle I know but it seemed to me a path of least resistance, and for the issues of the scripts, well, I have to run scripts anyways. 

After I made the list, which was a text file, I had issues parsing the file in the react component (Also made quickly with LLM support). I then thought, why not use JSON instead. I also then could add a title. The script for making the list in JSON ended up looking like this: 
```bash
#! /bin/bash
find docs -type f -name "*.md" | sed 's/\.mdUSD //' | awk -F/ -v q='"' 'BEGIN {
    print "["
}
function join(array, start, end, sep,    result, i) {
    result = array[start];
    for (i = start + 1; i <= end; i++) {
        result = result sep array[i];
    }
    return result;
}
{
    # Replace spaces with %20 (URL encoding).
    gsub(/ /, "%20", USD 0);

    # Split the path into parts.
    n = split(USD 0, parts, "/");

    # Determine the title.
    title = parts[n];
    gsub(/%20/, " ", title); # Revert %20 to spaces for title display.

    # Handle the case where the parent folder and file name are the same.
    if (n > 1 && parts[n] == parts[n-1]) {
        path = join(parts, 1, n-1, "/");
    } else {
        path = USD 0;
    }

    # Print the JSON object line.
    print (NR>1 ? "," : "") "  {\"path\": \"" path "\", \"title\": \"" title "\"}";
}
END {
    print "\n]"
}' > static/article_list.json
```

Quite complicated, yes? 
Then, I managed after struggling with removing one part of the path and generally acting like a GPT monkey, punching in the code from ChatGPT and pasting in error without any thoughts whatsoever. This was annoying. 
After making a separate component, realizing it was not a good way to make it (As it should be part of the overview page and could be reused there), making a custom function for it instead, making it work, and then realizing it worked locally but failed deployment to the cloud (FML).  Then it was debugging in the *npm run build*. Hooray!!!!!
I finally realized the error, as I did 
```javascript
const response = await fetch('@site/static/article_list.json');
const articles = response.json();
```
But It should have been
``` javascript
const articles = require('@site/static/article_list.json');
```
I wrapped my head around the concept of async for the nth time, and then it was there. I guess I am a fully-fledged senior front-end developer. 

The takeaway from this charming story of an undisturbed evening is the following: 
- A solution is first hacky, then generalized, and then elegant. With all things requiring both thought and skill. 
- Not understanding the output of LLM is bad. Trying to understand the output of LLM is good; understanding the output is better. 
## Vercel
In Vercel, you get to deploy quickly, and they have free hosting for some development. I was astonished at how super easy they deployed the page. It was an eureka moment. Making the deployment easy makes it more rewarding to focus on writing code. 

## Github

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmilRamsvik/Digital-Garden), as it is easy to create a repo and contains all the code and docs that should be available in the application. This repo separates the code from

# Thoughts 
- I am very pleased with how I worked on this project; I think it has been a good journey so far, and I hope to learn a lot more and share a lot more when it comes to working on the different things I try to learn. 
- Vercel is a super duper awesome product. 
- The ease of deployment is important; just type a command, and you get a new web page. Quite nice.
