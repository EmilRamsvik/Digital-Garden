# Unix




## Vim
I think that Vim has been one of the big productivity increasing tools for me. I had some challenges when learning them but after a while things got going and I felt more productive. What I enjoy the most is the easy and simple ways I can quickly manipulate text and get going. It kind of abstracts away the boring parts of it. 

### Neovim

## Grep
**grep** stands for "Global Regular Expression Print." It's a powerful command-line utility found in Unix-like operating systems
**Common Use Cases**
- **Code Search:** Finding specific function calls, variable names, or code structures within a codebase
- **Log Analysis:** Filtering system logs for error messages, warnings, or specific events.
- **General Text Manipulation:** Extracting information like email addresses, phone numbers, or other structured data from unstructured text.

## Emacs
Emacs can be defined as a cult.
I have not delved down that rabbit hole, and I do not think I intend to. 


Cults are cool if you are in them, so maybe it is worth it. Who am I to know.

- Ubuntu is zulu for: "A person is a person through (other) persons." ([97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](../../Books/Book%20Reviews/Programming/97%20Things%20Every%20Programmer%20Should%20Know.md))
- Would be awesome to be good at grep and sed. But alas.
