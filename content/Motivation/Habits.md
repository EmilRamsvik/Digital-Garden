# Habits
Habits are what you do automatically when a cue is triggered. There are two books on habit that I recommend. One is [Power of Habits](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/what-s-the-best-way-to-build-a-habit) by Charles Duhigg, and another is [Atomic Habits](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/what-s-the-best-way-to-build-a-habit) by James Clear. Both of those books are a good starting point. 

Habits are interesting, and they are a good way of disciplining yourself. 



## The Morning Routine

One of the best ways to implement a good routine or good habits is in the morning. I think when you wake up, it's probably one of the best times of the day to successfully execute good habits and start the day positively.

My morning routine is as follows. After a bathroom break, I do exercises focused on posture and stretches, as well as some push-ups and scapular push-ups. I took inspiration from various morning routines to make sure stretching is done quickly. This simple approach helps me actually do my posture exercises and improve my posture effectively. I divided it into a five-minute workout with 30-second exercises. Here is the inspiration behind the morning routine workout.

After the workout, I take a cold shower and continue my morning routine with getting dressed and personal hygiene. Then, I write a little note in my daily note template and enjoy a reward for a successful morning routine at Kapuke.

# Thoughts 
- When doing things, I have worked mostly on the small health and focus habits in the morning. It is much easier to "cue" in the morning than in the evening. 
- Bad habits are there for a reason; I think the removal of cues is important.  During the pandemic, I felt like it was too easy to grab a beer or something from the fridge, so I had to stop having beer in the fridge, then the monthly beer consumption fell drastically. *If there is honey in the jar the bear will eat it.* 
- One sick and disgusting thing of the modern economy is the exploitatio of the lizard brain of people to sell things. Stuffing food with sugars, making confusing stores that lead to the candy shelves. And all the other things that have happened. 
- What is a successful habit? How do we define a when a habit is a success? Does it have to be there forever?
- The morning is the best part for making a habit.
