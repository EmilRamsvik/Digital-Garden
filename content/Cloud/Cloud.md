# Cloud

Cloud has basically abstracted away the hardware parts. It is therefore become a major part of releasing software to actually understand cloud and being a good cloud user. 


## Infrastructure as Code 

There are a lot of good resources to learn infra as code, and there are, w unfortunatly a lot of different ways to use infra as code (IaC). However, I think that [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) is a good tool that works for most of the different types of cloud providers. 

# [Azure](Azure.md)
Leverages the Microsoft ecosystem to get customers. Aka, you already use Microsoft so why not just use cloud from Microsoft. 

# [GCP](GCP.md)
The little brother of the cloud providers. One big advantage is that you can leverage a lot of the google functionality as well.

# [AWS](AWS.md)
The largest, and also the best of the bunch, in my opinion. But with some of the issues related to Amazon that probably never be resolved. 


## Virtual Networks 
A Virtual Network, often abbreviated as VNet, is a logically isolated network within a cloud computing environment or your own on-premises data center. It enables you to control your own private space within the cloud, essentially acting as a slice of the cloud's overall network that you control.

#### Things to know: 
**DNS**: DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's essentially the "phone book" of the internet, translating human-friendly domain names like `www.google.com` into IP addresses like `172.217.22.14` that computers use to identify each other on the network.
**Cache**: a cache is a high-speed, temporary storage layer that stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature so that future requests for that data are served up faster than by accessing the data's primary storage location.
