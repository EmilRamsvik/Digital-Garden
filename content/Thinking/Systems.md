# Systems
Systems are what we have around us, and instead of focusing on the thing itself, is about how things interact with other things. I got introduced to thinking in systems from the book [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md) and I have tried to explore those topics more in detail later. 

Understanding systems is a tremendous advantage when it comes to understanding the world. This is especially true for social systems such as organizations, businesses, and other human social structures. 

## Systematics
The term _**systemantics**_ is a commentary on prior work by [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski") called [general semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics "General semantics") , which conjectured that all systems failures could be attributed to a single root cause – a failure to communicate.
1. Everything is a system.
2. Everything is part of a larger system.
3. The universe is infinitely systematized, both upward (larger systems) and downward (smaller systems).
4. All systems are infinitely complex.

## PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM

(in increasing order of effectiveness) 

12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).  
13. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.  
14. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).  
15. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.  
16. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.  
17. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.  
18. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).  
19. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).  
20. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.  
21. The goals of the system.  
22. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.  
23. The power to transcend paradigms.
This is based on [Leverage Points by Donella Meadows](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
## Reading list for System Thinkers
First, i think the best way to start is the book [Systematics](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/Systems/Systematics.md), as it is short and concise and really hammers down the point of system thinking. Then, I think a deeper exercise would be to take on [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md), as it is more technical in nature and explains the core concepts well. After that, reading [The Fifth Discipline](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/Systems/The%20Fifth%20Discipline.md) is a nice follow up, where the focus is more on the organization in the system thinking context.

# Thoughts 
- I would like to be better at system thinking, but I lack the experience and training. How to get this training?
- "Eighty-five percent of the reasons for failure are deficiencies in the systems and process rather than the employee. The role of management is to change the process rather than badgering individuals to do better." - W Edwards Deming
- I am facinated by how critical Donella Meadows (of [Thinking in Systems](../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md) fame) is to growth, namely naming them as a key obstacle rather than the solution. As for the last 50 years have shown, this looks increasingly like a very bad take. However, when i searched for critisms there were actually mostly articles saying they had a point. I found that interesting.
