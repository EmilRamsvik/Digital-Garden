# Thinking
Here, I write about ways of thinking about the world and the whys and hows. I am fascinated by how we as a species behave and act and how we can improve as a species.

- [Normalization of Deviance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bxZuzDKoI0&list=WL&index=17&t=7s): A concept where deviances are slowly accepted as a part of the process and not addressed. This might lead to catastrophic outcomes. The warning sign is always on.  [See this on culture and aviation safety as well. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_culture_on_aviation_safety)
- Pioneering safety researcher Jens Rasmussen observed a similar phenomenon, which he called [“**drift to danger**”](https://risk-engineering.org/concept/Rasmussen-practical-drift#ref-Rasmussen1997): systemic migration of organizational behavior toward accident under the influence of pressure toward cost-effectiveness in an aggressive, competing environment.

## Friction in Organisations 
- Organization and processes incur friction slowly.
-  Friction is an inevitable outcome of company growth, which we can control. But is increased by the normalization of deviance, which we can control.
# Thoughts 
- Normalization of deviance example can be shown in the Challenger Space Shuttle Accident, which was coined in the accident investigation. 
- You cannot predict the future, but you can train yourself for it. 
- Everyone on this earth is at the core stupid. That includes both the reader and writer of this section. Make sure that you always take this simple fact into account. 
- People judge themselves on their intents, but others on their actions.
