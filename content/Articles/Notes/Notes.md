# Notes
I try to take notes as much as possible, and having them stored. This is a great way to have something to look back upon as well as having a more complete reference of what has been done. 


## Meeting Notes

Meeting notes are some of the most important things I do in meetings. For me its mostly for the following reasons: 
1. It is easier to stay on point in the meeting and not drift. 
2. Everyone in the meeting has a common understanding of what has been said and done. This is not trivial 
3. We get concrete action items. 
   
I try to automate as much of the process, so i use [Alfred](../../Mac/Alfred.md) and snippets to create a standard format. I try to keep the written things as simple as possible, and make it easy to just jot down notes and have some action items. 

**Notes**
This is what has been said and discussed in the meeting. 
**Action Items**
This is just a single list of things that needs to be done, I like tagging people in the notes to make the tasks as clear as possible. Also, Elon Musk once said something that a task or a process should have a name attached it so here it goes. 

## Daily Notes
I have two types of daily notes, one in DayOne applicaiton and another for work which is a way for me to focus and make sure that I have a good understanding of what is the task for the day. 

## Articles

I write articles that will be a living thing, rather than a concrete thing that will be finished. I think that is one of the things that is different in a digital garden than a blog.
