# Music


##  Spotify
I primarily use Spotify to listen to songs and podcasts. It is my primary tool for music. I quite like their ways of adding music and their recommendations. 

### Playlists
- [House Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4jEECD9Jumkm8l0xNMC22D?si=4fd383a9026d402f)
- [Very Relaxing Classical Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/48nFdFtSM0sGnYVXoAyR6Y?si=f033f1ae29454e32)
- [Soft Pop, Indie Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50JCYkZ3BQvC4wSIXkcCo9?si=89e31166ffda47c6)

## Youtube
YouTube is primarily for music that is unavailable on Spotify, mainly because of copyrights or other issues. Most of the music I have is either remix covers or live performances. Also, I like to have some live sets in the background when I work or do other stuff. 
### Good Live sets
- [Parcels Live Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePSivyATBqg) From La Cigale, Paris. Outstanding sound quality. 
- [Cercle Mix is Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTUAWOgoHs&t=27s)
- [Sons of the East live in Copenhagen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsJqG35u7iA&t=620s&ab_channel=CasperHolst)


#### Brown Noise
I use the Spotify playlist for[ brown noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4hpot8sYudB?si=a04799a8bddb496e) when I am in a concentrated state.

- [Yale Listening to Music Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_yOVARO2Oc&list=PLh9mgdi4rNezhx8YiGIV8I22ICSuzslja): Interesting if you like to listen to classical music.

# Thoughts 
- Spotify characterizes listening into two types: *Lean-In*, which is active listening, and *Lean-Out*, which is just ambiance listening, not paying attention.
