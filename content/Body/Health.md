# Health
Health is important, and fortunately, I have been relatively free from sickness and health problems, both mentally and physically. 

Taking care of your health is probably one of the most important priorities you have, but it is difficult actually to prioritize it in the right way.  Here are some guidelines I use for myself:
1. Be aware of risks, especially when it comes to injury
2. Exercise is there not only for your body but also for your mind.
3. Enjoyment in the future is just as important as enjoyment in the now. 
4. Too much of a good thing is just as bad as too little. This is related to exercise, indulgencies, etc. 



# Health Services
I live in a country with free health care, but an option to have a private insurance, usually provided by an employeer. I think there might be good benefits to this model. I for one, quite liked the fact that I actually did not have to wait long for any appointments etc. 


It is important to understand that all types of surgery, either proper surgery with full anesthesia or just a local procedure, have associated risks and should be carefully evaluated. 
One of my reflections from my first anesthesia operation was that it was much more demanding than I expected. I think this might be the case for all operations. 



# Sleep 

 For some reason, I think I'm quite sensitive to sleep. I really like to get my eight hours because it makes me feel much more energized. I really notice it when I don't have enough sleep. Therefore, it's important for me to have a strict routine. There are a lot of things that have worked very well, and some things that could be improved.

- One thing that has been successful is actually keeping the room cold. To be honest, I used to prefer warm bedrooms, but after moving in with my partner, who likes cold rooms, I've developed a more positive attitude toward it. I think it is an improvement.Also dark rooms is critical. 
- Secondly, I use melatonin to fall asleep. It's not exactly a habit, but I find it helpful. I just take a pill, and it's part of my sleeping routine.
- Lack of sleep has been a problem before. I try to get at least 7.5 hours of sleep every day. I also maintain a consistent sleep schedule. I go to bed at 10:30 or 11:00, and I try to wake up at the same time each day. If, for some reason, there's been a delay, I still try to get as much sleep as possible. Sometimes, if work permits, I let myself sleep in to get the required rest.
- Lastly, I avoid doing things that expose me to a lot of light, like watching movies, doing soemthing on my phone. and instead I try to just read before bed. Reading actually helps me fall asleep. It's become a cue in my routineâ€”when I read in bed, I start to get sleepy.
