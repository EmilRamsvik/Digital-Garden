# Body

Taking care of your body is good. That is an understatement. 
Understanding how important [Exercise](../Exercise/Exercise.md) is and how to take care of your body. 


## Experimentation and Knowledge

I like to experiment with different ways of manipulating the body. And no, I do not mean drugs. However, it might be nice to think about taking a break from known drugs, such as caffeine and alcohol. 

### Sober October
I have experimented with different ways of doing sober October. Some things that can be cut. 
- Meat and fish, do a vegetarian month
- Alcohol
- Caffeine

This makes you more understanding of the things that affect your body and the withdrawals you get when cutting them out. You also will appreciate things more when you have.

# Dopamine

Dopamine, or epinephrine, is the the reward drug. It is important to understand the way dopamine affects you and how to master it.
