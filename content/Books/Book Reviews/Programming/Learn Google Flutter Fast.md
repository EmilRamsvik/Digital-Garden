# Learn Google Flutter Fast



# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is basically an introduction guide to google flutter and how to best start working with it. It goes through dart, flutter widgets, and state management, as well as other things. It gives example code as well as images of the apps created by the code. 

# üé® Impressions
I liked some of it. I sometimes feel the code examples are so long that it is almost impossible for me to understand what is being done, and I don't have enough context available to get an understanding of what is going on. 

## How I Discovered It
I googled flutter

## Who Should Read It?
People who are into flutter and still beginners.
