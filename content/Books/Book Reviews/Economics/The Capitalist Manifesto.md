- American study of the years between 1850 and 2015 shows that the period with the largest churn in the labour market – the most jobs destroyed and created – was the earliest, while the one with the least churn was the most recent.
 
- Studies of Uber and Lyft drivers in the United States consistently show that between 60 and 70 per cent prefer to have the job as a gig over a permanent job. And this is also the wrong question, since the real choice is between being a gig worker and having a smaller chance of permanent employment, because if companies have to pay fixed salaries and benefits, they will not be able to accept anyone, especially not someone who does not pull in a sufficient number of assignments or is not efficient.
 
- This means that for every job that disappeared due to Chinese imports, 150 workers lost their jobs due to a completely different cause.
 
- A detailed analysis of different US trade barriers showed that each saved job cost consumers on average six times more than the average wage in the manufacturing industry. So for each job saved by protectionism, we lost purchasing power that could have been used to employ six other workers.
 
- As the Marxist economist Michał Kalecki concluded in 1962 after seeing the desperate poverty in then-socialist countries such as India, the problem is that there are ‘too many exploited and too few exploiters’.
 
- The French economist Thomas Piketty has shown that income from interest and gains on capital grow faster than growth (r > g) and that inherited properties just grow and grow until a small elite has almost everything.
 
- His position is almost a caricature of a French intellectual sitting comfortably in his ivory tower, taking pride in ignoring what’s going on down there, in garages, shops and factories, and how that might be related to the fact he lives in history’s richest civilization. Piketty happens to confirm my prejudice. Since he turned twenty-five, he writes, ‘I have not left Paris, except for a few short trips.’
 
- Experts who estimate that about 70 per cent of the subsidies go to the 10 per cent largest agricultural holdings.
 
- ‘When buying and selling are controlled by legislation, the first things to be bought and sold are legislators,’ as P. J. O’Rourke has observed.
 
- Economists Esteban Rossi-Hansberg and Chang-Tai Hsieh estimate that about 93 per cent of increased concentration in the United States is due to large companies having established themselves in more places.

In addition, she fiddles with many of those stories.
 
- When I asked the energy expert Dieter Helm about the German energy transition’s three goals of reducing emissions, and increasing competitiveness and safety, he replied briefly: ‘to fail on one is something the politicians should answer for.

- In 2019, Germany’s Auditors General stated that the change had cost €160 billion in the last five years alone and that the expenditure is ‘in extreme disproportion to the results’.
 
- Governments are bad at picking winners, but losers are good at picking governments. Several researchers have identified the species ‘welfare entrepreneurs’, who systematically turn to various authorities to keep their business afloat for a while longer.

This makes it easier for poor countries, who face the greatest environmental challenges, to learn from our mistakes and from our progress. They can use technology that it took us many generations and many billions to develop. (From that perspective, tariffs on green technology are even more idiotic than tariffs in general.
