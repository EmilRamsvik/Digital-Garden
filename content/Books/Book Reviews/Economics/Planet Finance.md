# Planet Finance


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about the history of mankind as a function of finance and economics.  It was a good and interesting book. 

# üé® Impressions

I liked the story of the Potosi city. 


This was more interesting as a fun historical and financial read than for understanding some of the reasons why things are the way they are.

However, I think that, other than having a cocktail party anecdotes, it is more or less just a fun read.
