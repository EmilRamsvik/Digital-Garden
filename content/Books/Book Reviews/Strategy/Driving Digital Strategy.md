- Although Amazon started as a low-cost player without the fixed cost of stores, it is not product-centric knowledge that gives it an advantage of differentiation or low cost. Instead, Amazon has mastered three skills: Deep knowledge of customers obtained from mining customer data.

Back-end logistics for warehousing and shipping that could rival the logistics systems of FedEx and UPS.
