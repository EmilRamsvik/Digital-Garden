# The Triumph of Seeds



# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about seeds from trees. How did they evolve? How did they flourish? What causes them to be like they are?

# üé® Impressions
A very cool book about things taken for granted. It reminds me of the story of the physicists who declared that all multi-cell life has some form of immune system that was quickly shut down by the biologist who pointed at trees.  (Not an exact quote but the point stands.) I liked the deep dive into the causes of trees and some of the stories that came from it. Also, I quite enjoyed the mini-story of the rodents and their success. 


I have more respect for nature and how it drives the world, regardless of how we behave. Also, the complexities that evolve. Also, I found it interesting that trees used to have some sort of spores instead of seeds, quite fascinating.
