- Until the 1950s, the Soviet Union‚Äôs oil had come largely from Baku on the Caspian Sea, whose riches had been exploited since the nineteenth century. But now geologists began to develop new deposits in the Volga-Urals basin, and Soviet oil output doubled between 1955 and 1960.23 The Soviet Union displaced Venezuela as the second-largest oil producer in the world, behind only the US.
 
- Producing a tonne of aluminium uses the same amount of electricity as a US household consumes in a year. The energy consumption is so large that traders jokingly describe aluminium as ‚Äòcongealed electricity‚Äô. It‚Äôs why most smelters are built where electricity is cheap, such as Siberia with its hydropower, Iceland with its geothermal generation, or the Middle East with its natural gas.
 
- This type of deal, exchanging a raw material for a finished product, was called ‚Äòtolling‚Äô and had been used before in oil and zinc, but Marc Rich + Co brought it to the aluminium sector.
 
- In the 1980s, the list of countries that ‚Äòmost companies‚Äô wouldn‚Äôt dream of dealing with grew longer and longer. Exactly where to draw the line was a question of personal taste. Some traders were happy to do business in tricky countries such as India or the Philippines, but drew the line at war zones and pariah states. For others, any corner of the world was fair game.
 
- The traders weren‚Äôt making money through a brilliant understanding of the market. They were simply willing to put aside any ethical principles to make more money.
 
- Ultimately, Rich and Green never faced jail time or any financial penalty. After nearly two decades as fugitives hunted around the world by US marshals, they were pardoned by President Clinton in his last act before leaving office in January 2001, thanks to a careful lobbying campaign that included the prime minister of Israel and the king of Spain. The pardon triggered a rare show of consensus in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans uniting in condemnation.

The options were Skydiver, Blackheart and Trafigura. Everyone agreed Skydiver was not an ideal name for a highflying commodities trader; and Blackheart sounded a little too buccaneering, even for the trading industry. So Trafigura it was.
 
- At the time of its break-up, the Soviet Union pumped more oil than any other country in the world and was also one of the biggest producers of metals and grain. Now, at a stroke, it was transformed from a closed system into a shambolically integrated part of the world economy.
 
- Posen remembers that the Raznoimport bosses ‚Äòloved to be invited for dinner and drinks‚Äô.
 
- Among the new breed of Soviet entrepreneurs was Artem Tarasov, who shot to fame in the late 1980s after proclaiming himself the Soviet Union‚Äôs first legal millionaire. Like many others, he was making his fortune wheeling and dealing in the shadows of the Soviet economy. One day, he struck on an opportunity to buy some fuel oil. The situation was a microcosm of the inefficiencies of the Soviet system: an oil refinery in Ukraine was producing fuel oil to supply local power stations. When a mild winter came, the power stations used less, and so the refinery had excess supplies. With no other instructions on where to deliver it, the director of the refinery simply told his employees to dig holes in a nearby forest and pour the fuel oil into them.

- The naval fleet was sold for scrap, leading PepsiCo‚Äôs chairman to joke to the White House: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre disarming the Soviet Union faster than you are.‚Äô
 
- Doing business in a collapsing economy forced the traders to improvise. They would hire whole jets for $20 an hour, loading up with cases of cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whisky, the only currency they could use to buy fuel at remote airports in struggling Siberian towns. They‚Äôd arrive at vast mines and smelters where the Soviet-era bosses ‚Äì known as ‚Äòred directors‚Äô ‚Äì would start morning meetings with a glass of vodka, or several.
 
- The Russian press counted dozens of murders connected to the metal trade, and dubbed the struggle the ‚ÄòGreat Patriotic Aluminium War‚Äô. The victims included both allies and competitors of Trans-World, though Reuben has always denied any hint that he or his partners had any role in the violence.
 
- When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Cuba felt the full force of the spike in oil prices. When sugar prices also tumbled, it seemed that the markets were conspiring against Cuba. The shock was almost too much to bear. The island‚Äôs economy plunged into a period of hardship, known in Cuba as ‚Äòthe special period in time of peace‚Äô.
 
- The amount of commodities that a country consumes is, for the most part, a function of two factors: the number of people in the country, and their income. The relationship with commodity demand isn‚Äôt a straight line, however.
 
- As long as a country remains relatively poor, with annual per capita income below about $4,000, people spend most of their income on the basics they need to survive: food, clothes and housing.
 
- As long as a country remains relatively poor, with annual per capita income below about $4,000, people spend most of their income on the basics they need to survive: food, clothes and housing. What‚Äôs more, the governments of poor countries don‚Äôt have the money to make major investments in commodity-intensive public infrastructure, such as power plants and railways.
 
- Once a nation‚Äôs income rises above roughly $18,000‚Äì$20,000 per capita, households spend any extra income on services that require relatively small amounts of commodities: better education and health, recreation and entertainment.
 
- Commodity trading would soon supplant sports as the main focus of Glasenberg‚Äôs time and energy. Still, he ran the New York marathon in 1994, aged thirty-seven, in the respectable time of 3 hours, 34 minutes, and continued to compete in triathlons in Switzerland into his fifties.
 
- Between 2000 and 2008, global trade in oil increased by 27.2%. That was more than twice the rate of oil demand growth over the same period.
 
- These were dangerous times for anyone doing business in the Russian commodities sector. The aluminium wars became famous, but oil traders were also at risk. One day T√∂rnqvist‚Äôs business partner vanished, presumed murdered.

- Zimbabwe went from a breadbasket to a basket case. Nigeria pumped less oil in 1999, when democracy returned after decades of kleptocratic military rule, than it had done in 1979. Africa was, in the eyes of many foreign investors, ‚Äòthe hopeless continent‚Äô.
 
- ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no way to do business in the Third World without enriching government leaders,‚Äô said Calil. He explained how the practice of greasing the palms of African potentates evolved: ‚ÄòYou used to give a dictator a suitcase of dollars; now you give a tip on your stock shares, or buy a housing estate from his uncle or mother for ten times its worth.‚Äô

- In a day, a digger could make more money than a schoolteacher made in a week. For the artisanal miners, the copper and cobalt ore was the only source of income in an otherwise bleak economy.
 
- The purity of the Congolese ore was off the charts, not just for copper ore, but also for cobalt. The world‚Äôs average ore grade for a copper mine is about 0.6%. In Chile and Peru, any mine with an average ore grade of more than 1% would be seen as exceptionally good. In its early days, Mutanda had an average copper ore grade north of 3%.
 
- By the mid-2000s, Africa, in the traders‚Äô eyes, had become a place where the commodities that no one else wanted could be disposed of. It was not just the supplier of last resort, but also a buyer of last resort. And for the least scrupulous, it became a dumping ground.
 
- Some traders were worried about the impact of this massive diversion of global food supplies into fuel. Warren Staley, chief executive of Cargill until 2007, argued that the promotion of ethanol could end up taking food out of people‚Äôs mouths. ‚ÄòThe world will have to make choices,‚Äô he warned.

After her death, the charities she had founded looked to cash in their investment. They started lobbying the trading house to arrange an IPO, at least for Margaret‚Äôs stake in the business.

- Wyler, who was one of Glencore‚Äôs most senior executives until 2002. Once, he was stopped in Heathrow airport by customs officials shocked at the amount of cash in his luggage.

Knowing that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a receipt for what he was planning to spend it on, Wyler calmly replied: ‚ÄòI go gambling.‚Äô
 
- As Torbj√∂rn T√∂rnqvist, chief executive of Gunvor, puts it: ‚ÄòI think the old-style traders, the Marc Rich diehard breed, some of them don‚Äôt quite get it. Until they‚Äôre sitting and talking with the FBI. Then they get it.‚Äô
