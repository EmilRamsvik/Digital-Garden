# The Brothers Karamazov


# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences

It is a book that involves morality, love, and spirituality. It is a crime story with the morals of the characters being put on trial. 
# 🎨 Impressions
I found it to be the same as all books by Russian authors. Half the book is people making up new nicknames for each other and the other half is obscure references to Pusjkin. 

## How I Discovered It
It is known for being one of the best novels of all time.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
I was not that impressed, and I think the problem was that I used too much time to read the book and never got immersed in the book.

And God answered: now take that same onion, hold it out to her in the lake, let her take hold of it, and pull, and if you pull her out of the lake, she can go to paradise, but if the onion breaks, she can stay where she is. The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her: here, woman, he said, take hold of it and I’ll pull. And he began pulling carefully, and had almost pulled her all the way out, when other sinners in the lake saw her being pulled out and all began holding on to her so as to be pulled out with her. But the woman was wicked as wicked could be, and she began to kick them with her feet: ‘It’s me who’s getting pulled out, not you; it’s my onion, not yours.’ No sooner did she say it than the onion broke. And the woman fell back into the lake and is burning there to this day. And the angel wept and went away.
