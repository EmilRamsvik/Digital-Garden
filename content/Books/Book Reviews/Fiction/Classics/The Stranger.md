# The Stranger

# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
One of Albert Camus's greatest works. It tells the story of the main character from such a distant and objective point that the reader gets taken by the meaninglessness of it all. It is a damning view of the way we strive for meaning in an absurd universe.

# üé® Impressions
My first introduction to Albert Camus was a good and engaging read. It felt like the [*Gymnasl√¶rer Pedersens beretning om den store politiske vekkelse som har hjems√∏kt v√•rt land*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasl%C3%A6rer_Pedersens_beretning_om_den_store_politiske_vekkelse_som_har_hjems%C3%B8kt_v%C3%A5rt_land). It was sometimes written in a way where the reader just loses interest in everything, it is objectivism, existentialism, and absurdism combined. Most of all, the trivialities of life get exemplified in such a way that the reader feels exhausted. 

In my first introduction to Camus, I think I got depressed and cynical about the way the book was written. Everything felt different after reading, the purpose we strive for is all irrelevant. I must read more Camus for me to better understand his thoughts.

- Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.
 
- A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had no meaning, really; but I supposed I didn't.
 
- There are some things of which I've never cared to talk. And, a few days after I'd been sent to prison, I decided that this phase of my life was one of them.
