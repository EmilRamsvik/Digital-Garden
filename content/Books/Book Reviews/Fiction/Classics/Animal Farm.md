# Animal Farm


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences

The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves.

This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.

Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than just ribbons?
