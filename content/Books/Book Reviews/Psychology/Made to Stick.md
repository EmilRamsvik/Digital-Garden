Nothing is a sure-thing principle, the existence of uncertainty affects the decision even when the uncertainty is not affecting decision parameters. 

If you have more alternatives to the "right" options, you are more likely to choose the right option. For example, if I want to study but have the option of going to a talk,  then I am less likely to go study than if I have both the option to attend the talk and go to the cinema. 

"Proverbs are short sentences drawn from long experience"  - Michel Cervantes.
