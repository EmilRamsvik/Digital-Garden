# Start with No


# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about negotiations but slowly becomes a self-help book. It argues against compromise and says that *no* is an important word in negotiations. *Maybe* is the worst word in negotiations. 

# 🎨 Impressions
It was an okay book, not that many interesting thoughts that really stuck with me.  I quite liked the preparation and understanding of the motivations of the "opponent" in negotiations; you need to "solve" their problems, not your own. 

People who want to expand their knowledge of negotiations. 

Nothing is certain in negotiations.

- *Three-Minute Checklist • Are you playing a “numbers” game, even a subtle one? It’s just a cop-out. Focus instead on your activity and behavior. • The temptation to “close” is powerful and in some businesses, like real estate, almost ingrained. You must keep a sharp eye. Are you subtly trying to “close” this agreement? • Hold everything. Is this phone call or this meeting payside or nonpayside? Are you kidding yourself about its value? • Did you start setting and evaluating activity and behavior goals daily?* 
 
- *Perot enjoyed (and may still, I don’t know) telling business audiences the story of an American who wants to buy a camel and pulls up at a tent with half a dozen of the beasts staked out front. When the owner emerges, the American asks the owner about one particular animal. The Bedouin replies, “Oh, that’s my son’s camel, his pet. I couldn’t sell that one.” The American looks nonplussed, climbs back into his Range Rover, and starts to drive off. The Bedouin runs after him, shouting, “I thought you wanted to buy my camel!”*

	- *If the mission-and-purpose statement is in hand, read it. Absorb it. If necessary, have it handy for quick consultation.*

- *The people on the other side are negotiating for their benefit, not for yours. This is self-evident but often overlooked, and it’s the reason your mission and purpose must be rooted in the world of the other side and bring benefits that solve their problems.* 
 
- *In negotiations, you must have a vision of a current or future problem to be solved. It’s just that simple. This is why you’re negotiating.* 
 
- *Three-Minute Checklist • Are you certain you clearly see the problems on the other side?

- *Are you prepared with good interrogative-led questions? They are not a magic bullet, but they are the safest way to build vision on the other side, and they are less likely to destroy vision. • Being a defensive negotiator does you no good at all. Therefore always nurture. Don’t attack, don’t challenge, don’t browbeat—not with your words, not with your body language.*

	- *Now you’re ready to talk less, ask questions, listen well, and find out what’s going on.*

- *Each and every communication in a negotiation requires an agenda—and not just meetings where you’re sitting across the table from the other side. Agendas are required even for telephone calls and e-mails.*

	- *Identification of the decision-makers and assessment of when their decision will be reached* 
	- *Negotiation summary*
 
- *With the Checklist before the meeting, you set up the structure with which to build vision on the other side. With the Log after the meeting, you gather together the vision that exists at the end of the meeting, lay everything out, look at it, and find ways to build more vision and move ahead.*
