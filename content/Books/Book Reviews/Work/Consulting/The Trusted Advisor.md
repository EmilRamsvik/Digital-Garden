# The Trusted Advisor


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about consulting. The book highlights that a consultant is not a seller, but rather an advisor who should be a trusted part of a company. The tools and ways for a consultant to gain this trust are discussed in this book. 

# üé® Impressions
The importance of gaining trust is all that this book gives. As a consultant, you are hired for your expertise but retained because of the trust the client has in you to do what is right for the client. 
You are not always there to deliver a product (competence) but rather to help the client reach their business goals. 
Relationships are the building block of a consultant. 

Your job as an advisor is not to be right, it is to be helpful.
