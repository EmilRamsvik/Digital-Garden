# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top  Quotes

- *"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." - Mike Tyson*
- *"Now I will have less distraction." - Leonhard Euler, Mathematician upon losing sight in his right eye.*
- *"Memory is the residue of thought" - David Willingham, a cognitive psychologist*
- *Feynman Technique:
Write down the concept or problem you won't understand at the top of a piece of paper.
In the space below, explain the idea did as if you had to teach it to someone else.     
If it is a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who's never heard of it before.
If it is a problem, explain how to solve it and, crucially, why that's solution procedure makes sense.
When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book or test or teacher or reference material to find the answer.*

- *Principles of Ultralearning:
Meta-learning: First draw a map of what you want to learn.
Learn how you will learn, do your research on resources and tools that will help you achieve your learning outcome.
Focus: Sharpen your knife. 
Find the time to learn and concentrate.
Directness: Go straight ahead. 
Focus on the thing you want to learn. Remove all secondary and trivial learning activities.
Drill: Attack your weakest point.
Break down complex skills into small parts and focus to improve your weakest points.
Retrieval: Test to learn.
Test yourself before you feel ready. Push yourself to actively recall information rather than possibly review material.
Feedback: Don't dodge the punches. 
Extract the signal from noise, don't be afraid of harsh feedback.
Retention: Don't fill a leaky bucket. 
Understand what you are forgetting and why.
Intuition: Dig deep before building up. Understand how understanding works, not memorization.
Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone.
 True understanding comes from exploring and experimenting on your own.*
