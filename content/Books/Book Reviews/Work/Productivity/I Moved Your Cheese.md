# I Moved Your Cheese


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is a fairy tale about mice and labyrinths. The characters of Max, Big, and Zed are musing on the fact that the mice are all in the maze and looking for cheese when there is no one asking why the cheese is always being moved around. 
How come there is no one trying to look outside the maze? 

# üé® Impressions
It was a short but weird book; I felt like it went above my head. Not much I can reflect on here. 


# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top  Quotes

-  Go elsewhere to find the cheese.
 
- Personal reflection is the most important aspect of growth and learning.
