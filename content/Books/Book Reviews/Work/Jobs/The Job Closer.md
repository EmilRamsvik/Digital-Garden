# The Job Closer


# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about CVs, resumes, interviews, and negotiating. It is sharp, to the point, and concise. It is focused on the science of job application and skips the fluff. 

# üé® Impressions
I liked this book a lot, I think it is something I will refer a lot to later. 
The focus on the data is something that is thought-provoking. 
It is closly linked to my experiences in [Job Searcing](../../../../Working/Job%20Searching/Job%20Searcing.md). I also like the fact that it was concise and had a big focus on what matters and simple but I think, quite effective rules for job interviews and searching.

I have used this as a reference when working on interviews a lot, and it is one of the few things that pops up again and again when approaching an interview setting.

By doing so, the program helps individuals turn strangers into advocates and potential mentors in a short amount of time.

- Resumes continue to be heavily emphasized because they give job seekers two critical perverse incentives.
  
- ‚ÄúYour job search will probably take you about a hundred hours; your resume should take no more than three of them.‚Äù I call this Ed‚Äôs Three-Hour Rule.
 
- Perverse incentives are an economic term for situations in which desired actions have undesirable results.
 
- Perverse incentives are an economic term for situations in which desired actions have undesirable results. Perverse incentives are also sometimes referred to as the cobra effect,
 
- An accomplishment statement is a description of the impact you made with the responsibilities you held, rather than just the responsibilities themselves. This is the key factor that differentiates Good and Great Resumes from Basic Resumes.
 
- Responsible for refrigerated biscuit marketing budget of $400 million (BASIC RESUME) Analyzed advertising channels to optimally allocate $400 million marketing budget (GOOD RESUME) Optimized $400 million marketing budget by analyzing historical returns and increasing budget to highest-return channel (newspaper inserts), increasing profits by 22 percent (GREAT RESUME)
 
- The good news is that cover letters are far more interesting than resumes. They illustrate how well you can construct an argument (when responding to the question ‚ÄúWhy should we consider you?‚Äù specifically).
 
- Imagining that this cover letter is an email to our boss‚Äôs boss. It‚Äôs going to be short, to the point, authentic, customer-focused, error-free, and done.
 
- RAC (Reason-Anecdote-Connection) Model, a framework we‚Äôll use again later during interviews to answer ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù questions (like ‚ÄúWhy our company?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy this role?‚Äù).
 
- Essentially, a RAC Letter is a five-paragraph cover letter with an introductory paragraph, three RAC paragraphs in which you systematically detail why you think you‚Äôd be a good fit, and a short closing paragraph asking for an interview and providing contact info.
 
- In almost all cases, a cover letter is accompanied by your resume. That is where your accomplishments are listed.
 
- Use your cover letter to tell readers what your resume means to them. Interpret it for them, as you would your findings from a project
 
- They need a nickname because of their sheer predictability and the fact that 60 percent of interview decisions are made by the time an interviewer has asked them, according to a 2015 study of 691 interviews by Frieder, Van Iddekinge, and Raymark.*  Note: Which nickname? TMAY most likely. 
 
- So, 5 percent of interviewers will make decisions on candidates within the first minute, based on their first impression.
 
- Another 25 percent make up their mind between the first and fifth minute, the period when small talk is usually covered, perhaps with a transition to TMAY. Again, just a statement of fact: three in ten interviews are decided based only on first impressions, small talk, and (possibly) TMAY.
 
- An additional 30 percent make up their minds between the fifth and fifteenth minute. This is typically the time when the Big Four get asked. Thus, 60 percent of interviews are decided based only on first impressions, small talk, and the Big Four.
 
- They are the four interview questions you are most likely to get at the start of your interviews, namely: Tell me about yourself (TMAY). Why this job? Why our organization? Why this sector/industry?
 
- While many of us have taken speech classes at some point in our education or careers, woefully few of us have taken listening classes.
 
- FIT (Favorite part-Insight gained-Transition made) will help you maintain all the goodwill and rapport you developed during the small talk and quickly catch them up on how you ended up here with them in this moment.
 
- There‚Äôs even a Latin phrase for this concept, omne trium perfectum‚Äîroughly translated, ‚Äúevery set of three is complete.‚Äù
 
- The Ready-to-Eat recognizes that most projects in any profession follow a standard process of three Actions: Understand the challenge. Brainstorm solutions. Implement the best solution(s).
 
- It‚Äôs a CAR story with a Takeaway (the T in CART) added at the end. Takeaways are unifying thoughts added to the end of CAR stories when you revisit the original question and very explicitly explain how your story answers that question.
 
- It‚Äôs a common joke among and about strategy consultants that they will often start answers in a Rule of Three format (as in ‚ÄúThere are three main reasons why‚Ä¶‚Äù) while having only two reasons in mind, but with full confidence that they‚Äôll think of a third reason by the time they‚Äôre done talking. (I‚Äôm no exception; old habits die hard!
 
- ‚ÄúThe biggest thing I‚Äôve learned about effective communication is to think like your audience before choosing what to say. What information will the buyers‚Äînot their bosses, nor Wall Street, nor the consultants‚Äîfind most compelling?
 
- The peak-end rule states that people rate an experience based on a combination of two moments‚Äîthe experience‚Äôs most intense moment and the final moment of the experience‚Äîrather than an average of every moment of the experience.
 
- ‚ÄúWhen will I hear back regarding my status in this process?‚Äù This question is for you. I can‚Äôt even tell you how many times I have seen job seekers panic for days, weeks, and even months after an interview because they failed to ask this one simple question.
 
- I recommend making this question either a rapport-building question, an expensive question (again, that‚Äôs my term for a question that proves you‚Äôve done your research), or a Research and Rapport (R&R) question that offers the best of both worlds. The general formula for an R&R question is ‚ÄúI read about \[relevant trend in this employer‚Äôs space\] in \[reputable source\]. Has that impacted you and your work? If so, how?‚Äù
 
- There‚Äôs a concept called commitment and consistency that psychologist Robert Cialdini identified in his 1984 book Influence. In one study he cites, he found that bystanders who verbally agreed to watch a fellow beachgoer‚Äôs things intervened to prevent a (simulated) robbery 95 percent of the time, whereas bystanders who gave no verbal commitment intervened just 20 percent of the time.
 
- For some interviewers, the thank-you note means nothing; for others, it means a lot. Remember that nearly a quarter of interviewers (22.5 percent) make up their minds after the interview.
 
- In negotiation terms, the ‚Äúbecause‚Äù is a show of good faith that you‚Äôre not engaging in arbitrary positional bargaining; there are real reasons underlying your request for more, and it‚Äôs a signal to the employer that you would like the same‚Äîfor them to provide the reasons why, if they choose to decline your request.
 
- It consists only of doing a brain dump of all the pros and cons of accepting an offer so they are out of your head and into a list. Add to this list throughout the day as more pros and cons come to mind. This isn‚Äôt about seeing whether accepting the offer has more pros rather than cons; it‚Äôs more about offloading them, ensuring that you do not constantly cycle through them one at a time in your head all day or, equally bad, forget one or more of them.
 
- However, despite the power of coffee chats and weekly manager meetings to help keep your path to full-time employment and/or advancement on track, they are both widely underutilized and woefully underdiscussed.
 
- Coffee chats are informational meetings that you‚Äôd conduct once you‚Äôre on board at a new employer.
