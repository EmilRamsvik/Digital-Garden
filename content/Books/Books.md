# Books 
Books are an excellent way to engage yourself in something completely. It is one of my favorite ways to learn and understand things, and I want to be able to read every day. 


I usually try to read before I go to sleep; the ritual makes me sleepy and prepares me to sleep. 


# Non-Fiction
I mostly read nonfiction, as I usually do not find it that difficult to get into nonfiction books. I think this is because a lot of the context in nonfiction is set; you know the world, you know what the premisses are, and therefore, you do not have to use a lot of mental capacity.  
- Reading quite technical manual such as O´reilly books has been a pleasant surprise. I made more progress and find them more interesting than I anticipated. 
- What is best, to try to read up on theory and then execute or start early with practice and experimentation? I do not know, but I have an inkling. I think a good strategy is getting you feet wet, then read up when you understand the basics, and then go practice with the theory in mind to become more proficient. 

# Fiction
Fiction is something that is important to read, and great works may stay with you for a long time. There is no shame in reading fantasy or science fiction. 
I am a sucker for reading science fiction; it is a guilty pleasure, and to be honest, it does not require that much brain power.

# Thoughts 
- Books demand your attention in a very different way than other things. If you stop reading, then you stop, period. This means that phones, TVs, and other distractions are basically just that, distractions. When I started to read again seriously, I constantly reached for my phone to check it. It was strange to really see how little attention span I had. 
- Reading disciplines you to take time and concentrate on just one thing. This is important in a distracted society. 
- You can overcome the urge to do things on your mobile phone and read instead; it just takes awareness of the issue, patience, and consistency.
- Reading is my form of relaxation.
