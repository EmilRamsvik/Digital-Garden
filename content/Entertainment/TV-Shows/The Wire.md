# The Wire

# ðŸš€  The show in 3 Sentences
This show is not a typical cop show. The Wire examines the war on drugs and its horrific consequences.  It is also about people and institutions and how they relate to each other.

# ðŸŽ¨ Impressions
The Wire demands and rewards your attention.  There are no bad guys or good guys, everyone has their own agenda and framework. 

## Most important scenes


## Quotes
- They used to make steel there, no? - â€‰*Spiros Vondas*
- *All in the game*
- *A lie ain't a side of a story, its just a lie.*

All the quotes from the wire, displayed in each episode, are gold:

## Who Should Watch It?
EVERYONE. This is probably the best series made.
