# Film making
## Editing
Filmmaking and modern filmmaking theory originated in France so most of the terms used in film-making are French. 

- Couper: To cut, the physical act of cutting movie films.
- Monter: To edit, the creative act of editing.
- Montage: The finished edit. 
- Closure: The more iconic or cartoonish a clip is, the easier it is to achieve closure. 

It is not the actor that matters, it's the edit.
