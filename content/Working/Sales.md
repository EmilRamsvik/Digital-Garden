# Thoughts 
- Active listening is also a sales skill. 
- Passion is important here. 
- When thinking about sales, consider that almost all of the top management within almost all companies have experience within sales. 
- [Consulting](Consulting.md) is closely related to sales, you are in fact, selling your self. (This is also why consultants are called "Whores in pin-stripe suits).
