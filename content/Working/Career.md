# Career
Here I write about career and about how to better oneself in one's career. 

Every weekday for 8 hours, we work and are in a work setting. Thriving in 50 % of your waking hours is paramount. And working on improving your methods and habits at work is what will seperate you from the others. 


## List of important attitudes
**Soft edges for co-workers, sharp edges for yourself** 
>You should have a high standard for the way you work and be a bit lenient on others. If you have too sharp of an edge against people you are going and having to cooperate with, you will make enemies and you will not be as productive. 

**Networks are the multiplier** 
> You can be as good an engineer as possible, and you can be an extremely productive developer, but if you don't know who to talk to, you will be stuck and be a replaceable cog in the machine.  jj

# Thoughts 
- Try to be bold. 
- When it comes to major turning points, never make the easiest decision. Do hard things, and do them as well as you can. 
- When quitting the first time, you will be very afraid and skeptical about the decision and mull over it for a long time. The next time won't be as hard. 
- I do think that having good friendships with your co-workers are important. I am blessed to have made a lot of friends among my co-workers, but many of them where made in the first few years.
