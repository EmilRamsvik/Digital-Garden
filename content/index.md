# Emil's Digital Garden 🌱

Welcome to my personal knowledge repository—a living digital garden where ideas grow, evolve, and interconnect. As a data scientist and lifelong learner, I've cultivated this space to document insights, learnings, and experiences across technology, business, and life.

> *"A garden is not a building; it should let its inhabitants live, grow, and evolve naturally."*

## 🎯 **About This Garden**

This knowledge base represents my commitment to continuous learning and knowledge sharing. Built using the **CAE methodology** (Create, Add, Enhance), it grows organically through daily reflection and systematic improvement. Each section contains both practical insights and theoretical understanding gained through professional experience and extensive reading.

**Current Stats:** The garden contains 321 files and 30,608 lines of text. The garden has 307 internal links and  651 links to external sites. I have also written 200+ book reviews.
