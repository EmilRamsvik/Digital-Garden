# Curiosity
One of the core values of my life is to stay curious and seek knowledge and experience. 
Curiosity is the enabler of growth, and it is important to let the spark and joy of learning not be distinguished. 

I think being bored is an intrinsic part of curiosity, and letting the mind wander is extremely important. I think my runs, without any music, podcasts, or audiobooks, help a lot on this.  


I hate being narrow-minded, not accepting alternative opinions, and being unopened to new ideas. I might not be new-age, but I love to explore yoga. I never realized that I liked management and being a tech lead until I figured it out. I had to put in a heck of a lot of effort to get into running, but now I really appreciate it. Sometimes, you do not really know what you like until you try it. I aspire to be the one who wants to try new things and then decide. 


In the end, we are all just humans. I think a lot about this, and I am extremely grateful for the upbringing that enabled me to see the best in all people and be empathetic towards how other people feel and act. I try to the best of my ability to put myself in other people's shoes and understand their motivations and aspirations. Then, the slights and negligence are not that bad cause they are not personal.
