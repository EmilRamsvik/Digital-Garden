# History
Here, I try to write down some thoughts regarding history and share things and thoughts that I think are interesting from a historical perspective.




# World War I
- One of the finest books in history is the ones written on world war one. 
- In some there was a casualty for every meter of ground. 
- [Not so quiet on the western front](https://open.spotify.com/show/64bg6BvW4OlrrtbgSpBtDz?si=768e10daf89f467b) - [Podcasts](../Podcasts/Podcasts.md)


# Links
- [Lend-Lease Contribution to the War was Significant](https://www.rferl.org/a/did-us-lend-lease-aid-tip-the-balance-in-soviet-fight-against-nazi-germany/30599486.html) This is also discussed in great detail in [How the War was Won](../Books/Book%20Reviews/History/Europe/How%20the%20War%20was%20Won.md). 
- [History Blog](https://acoup.blog/) - It is especially interesting how the process of making clothes, food and iron was done. 

# Thoughts 
- [A gag I saw on Twitter: “Every Pacific encounter from late 1943 onward is like the IJN Golden Kirin, Glorious Harbinger of Eternal Imperial Dawn, versus six identical copies of the USS We Built this Yesterday, supplied by a ship that does nothing but make birthday cakes for other ships.”](https://bsky.app/profile/theraseth.bsky.social/post/3kg24mgsxd72w)
- Empires take a long time to collapse.
