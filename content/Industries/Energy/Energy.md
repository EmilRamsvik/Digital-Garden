- [How the World Really Works](../../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/World/How%20the%20World%20Really%20Works.md) A little bit about how energy is driving. 
- [How Big Things Get Done](../../Books/Book%20Reviews/Science/World/How%20Big%20Things%20Get%20Done.md) Might be interesting in the context of big power projects, and why solar power, with its modularity, is interesting. Solar power costs have decreased exponentially.
