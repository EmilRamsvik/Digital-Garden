# AI Strategy
AI strategy is about having a clear view of how to enable the organization to utilize AI capabilities. An AI strategy should encompass the following subsets of strategies. 


- **Data Strategy**
	Data strategy covers data management, accessibility, and utilization of data. 
- **Machine Learning Strategy**
	Machine learning strategy covers the implementation of infrastructure, the serving of models, inferencing, and monitoring of machine learning models, and implementation of machine learning operations and platforms.
- Data Science and Analytics Strategy.
	The Data Science and Analytics strategy covers the implementation of a guideline for data science and integration with business. Data Science should bridge business use cases and the implementation of analytical and statistical methods. 

*Note: The use of AI strategy instead of machine learning strategy is because of the more technical nature of the term machine-learning versus the more ambiguous term AI*

# Thoughts 
- It is more important for business stakeholders to focus on viable business use cases and make measurable KPIs than finding out what machine learning can be utilised for. Machine Learning is just a means to an end, not the end goal itself. Let the machine learning engineers figure out the way there, that is what they are paid to do. 
- Machine learning projects fail because there are no actionable effects from the output. The output of an AI project in itself is worthless; it is the business value that matters.
