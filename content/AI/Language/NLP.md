# NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is using machine learning techniques to work with text. 
*Natural language* is a language that has developed naturally in use (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code).


## Transfer learning


- The default learning rate for Adam is usually way too high for transfer learning, one thing you can do is have a decaying learning rate for the optimizer.  For example, you can use a learning rate based on a polynomial learning rate.
