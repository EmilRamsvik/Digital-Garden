# Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning is the process of turning the data you have into data that is usable. It is, for the lack of a better term, the fight against entropy in the data domain. 


## Domain Knowledge
To be successful in the data cleaning domain, understanding the domain is paramount. This is a good chance to team up with domain knowledge experts and exploit their intricate understanding of the business cases. 

### Approach to Cleaning and Understanding Data
I like this approach, as it has worked well with some of my previous projects

# Thoughts 
- I always muse back on the quote of Lester Fremon from the first season of The Wire. [The "*this is the job*" quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH1xzI5ASys&ab_channel=MConflict)
- Always write down things that you find intersting, weird or out of place. This is a great place to discuss later with stakeholders.
