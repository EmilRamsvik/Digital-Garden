# Strength Training
I started strength training when I was 17, and did some on and off until I was 19. From 19 to 24, I consistently worked out between 3 and 5 days a week.  I did a lot of failing and needed a lot of guidance during that period. First of all, I started with only upper body exercises and neglected to work out my legs for quite a while. I think this was because I was not flexible enough to do the squat exercises correctly. In hindsight, it is difficult to assess in hindsight what the causation for the lack of leg exercises, but I am certain the lack of flexibility made doing leg workouts quite a bit difficult.

# Thoughts 
- Strength training is super good with some partner. It keeps you both accountable, and it motivates you to work out together. 
- I found the ["Sally"](https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/why-bu/sportbu/premium-portal/bring-sally-challenge) workout to be a nice finisher, especially squats on leg day. When it comes to push-ups, I usually find them too hard to complete as a finisher.  
- Deadlift is the ultimate exercise. It should be a staple of all strength training programs.  I like to start with a deadlift and then do more functional training later.
- Focus on the fundamentals.
