# Flexibility
I started working on flexibility far too late, but it is an awesome way of doing quick workouts at home. 

All you need is a phone with some guidance, a yoga mat, and maybe a pillow. As long as you are alone, you don't even need clothes :). 

## Yoga
I think yoga has been a tremendous addition to the workout regimen i have. There has been a couple of things that I would have liked to understand earlier.
- **Hatha**: Gentle yoga
- **Vinyasa**: Flowing yoga
- **Ashtanga**: Intense yoga
- **Bikram**: Hot yoga
- **Iyengar**: Precise alignment yoga
- **Kundalini**: Spiritual yoga
- **Restorative**: Relaxing yoga
- **Yin**: Slow-paced yoga focusing on connective tissues
- **Pilates**: Core-strengthening exercise system inspired by yoga

Sometimes, I have just joined and hoped for the best. It has been very cool and one heck of a challenge from time to time.

### Thoughts 
- Hot yoga is quite cool. Relaxing and in winter time in Norway it is very good to have some warmth in your body. 
- Anyone who have done proper yoga will understand that it is an exercise.
