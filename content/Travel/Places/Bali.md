# Bali


# Description
Bali is an Island in Indonesia. It is an excellent place to be, but it is full of tourists and digital nomads. There is almost a sub-culture there. 


## Best Experiences
Surfing was a highlight, and it was easy to learn to surf there. Uluwatu is known as a surfer's paradise. 

In Ubud, there are lots of retreats for yoga and meditation. I went to a silent retreat. It was very cool to go there and experience being detached from modern life's stress and constant disturbances. 


Gili Was Cool,

## Souvenirs 
- Bali Coffee is nice to bring back home. 
- They are quite proud of their local liqueur, Arak. 


## Food
- Pork Belly Satay was super lovely. It is called *Sate Babi Samcan* [YouTube Rudimentary Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4iA8AWNDr4&list=WL&index=16&t=9s)
- There were many different vegan options; one thing I noticed was all the breakfast and *brekkie* places. It was very noticeable. 

# Gili
I went to Gili Trawangan over easter in 2023; I had some pleasant experiences there and felt it was living up to a relaxed place. 

- I took a diverse introductory certificate there. Pretty fun and interesting place to visit. 
- If you can take a cooking course, I can recommend a cool way to vibe with the local cuisine and get inspired. 
- Run around the island, which is a very nice trip, then take a bath afterward. 
- Snorkeling is cool, also. 
- We had a lot of issues with the ferry, lots of hucksters trying to get you to take "their boat."  Be careful there. 

## Places to Eat
- [Banyan Tree](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oQeiGzk3YjciK8S68) is A very nice vegan place; It's nice to visit and have brekkie or lunch.  
- [Italian place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cRmJi1tkgk32o6an8)
- [Indonesian, Vietnamese](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cRmJi1tkgk32o6an8) Need to book beforehand, not easy to get spots there. Very cool restaurant to visit. 
- [Cafe and Brekkie place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zudAZt744nEtHX1C9): Get eggs benedict and a daily boost smoothie. I made the daily boost my go-to smoothie later.

# Thoughts 
- Bali is predominantly a Hindi Island, which might explain why it is so popular as a meditation retreat. 
- Everyone there was super polite and nice. 
- I quite liked the places I visited. 
- When on a silent retreat, I experienced caffeine withdrawals.
