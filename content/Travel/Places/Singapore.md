# Singapore


# Description
I lived in Singapore for 6 months and had a splendid time; I actually did most of the tourist stuff when I returned from a work trip. 

## Best Experiences
Singapore is the heart of South East Asia (SEA). I think some of the best experiences are related to immersion in the different cultures at the heart of the city-state.  Chinatown and Little India are definitely places I can recommend. 

Also, visit East Coast Park when there is a sunset. Watching the lights of the hundreds of ships in the strait is definitely an experience of a lifetime. 

A Singapore visit is definitely not complete without a visit to:

- **Gardens by the Bay** is a Very cool place to visit. Go and see the light show and from there go to Marina Bay Sands and take a drink. 
- **East Coast Park** Go there at sundown and then see the ships in Singapore Straight light up. Also fun for running exercises. 
## **After-Work Hangouts in Singapore**

If you're looking to relax after a long day or simply want to explore Singapore's vibrant nightlife, here are some must-visit spots:

### **Important things to consider before going to Singapore:**
This is as of 2023, some things might have changed. 
1. **Grab Application**:
   - **What is it?** Grab is primarily a transportation app in Singapore, similar to Uber.
   - **Why should you care?** It's one of the most convenient ways to get around the city. You can also use it as an alternative to cash some places. 
   - **Action Step**: Download the Grab app and make sure to add your payment card to it.

2. **Cash**:
   - **What is it?** Physical money, of course! But in Singapore, it's particularly important at hawker centers.
   - **Why should you care?** While many places in Singapore accept card payments, hawker centers (popular open-air food courts) often operate on cash or app-based payments.
   - **Action Step**: Ensure you have cash on hand, especially when visiting hawker centers. A typical meal usually costs between 5 and 10 dollars, depending on drinks and other add-ons. 

3. **Clothing**:
   - **What is it?** A reminder about the indoor climate.
   - **Why should you care?** While Singapore has a tropical climate, indoor areas like offices can be quite chilly due to air conditioning.
   - **Action Step**: It's smart to pack a light sweater or some warm clothing. You might need it, especially in office settings. It is also nice on flights as well.

3. **Immigration**:
   - **What is it?** You need to submit an immigration declaration among other things before arriving.  Note: Only 2 days before can you fill it in. 
   - **Why should you care?** It is annoying to do this when arriving and tired.
   - **Action Step**: [Fill inn](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore/sg-arrival-card)

# Thoughts 
- Running in Singapore was a special event. My reptile brain made me jump a couple of feet in the air when I saw an actual reptile a meter before me on a run.  This actually happened more than one time
- Running was exhaustive; my kilometer time was at least 60 seconds slower than in *optimal* conditions. 
- I would very much like to learn more about how Singapore got to the place it is. Thinking about reading the biography of [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew).
