# Denmark

# Copenhagen
I "lived", aka commuted to Copenhagen for some time in 2024. It is quite possibly my favourite city in the world. It is the big brother of my hometown, Oslo, which also makes it better. 


## Best Experiences
Get a "smørrebrød" and a glass of wine and enjoy. 

I quite like the experience of visiting [RundeTårn](Ny Adelgade 7, 1104 København K, Denmark). It is not the biggest attraction, but it is fun regardless, and the walk to the top is a little fun.
