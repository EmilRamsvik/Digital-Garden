# Oslo
I live in Oslo, and I think that this is more of a nice little guide to people who have not been there.
I want this guy to be more of a simple way of highlighting some of the amazing things that Oslo can bring to you. Furthermore, I also want to highlight some cool places that are interesting and nice to visit but also not only focusing on larger, bigger things, but more hidden gems.

Oslo city is very small. I think you can travel very well just by using your own to pair your feet something that might be a good solution in summer times provided that it's not raining. It's actually using the El-Scooters. Those bikes are handy. There are a lot of them, and the infrastructure for biking is quite developed in Oslo city. However, there are a lot of hills so it might be kind of exhausting to bicycle the normal way, but also quite okay.


## Best Experiences
One of the best things in oslo is the closeness to nature. And depending on the season, there are a lot of great things to do. 

In the summertime, early autumn, and late spring, I think being able to go out in the fjord and explore is very nice.  Go to [VisitOslo](https://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/boroughs/oslo-fjord/attractions/) to see the island and how to get there.

Also, I can highly recommend, if you are up to a mini-walk/hike, to walk up from [Storo to Grefsenkollen](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Storo,+0485+Oslo/Grefsenkollen+restaurant,+Grefsenkollveien,+Oslo/@59.9517806,10.7822992,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x46416e3d2c622943:0xa5f44d3ec9090ff6!2m2!1d10.7784683!2d59.9447924!1m5!1m1!1s0x464171df7343b3df:0x4226d90f04122d3!2m2!1d10.8039787!2d59.9587824!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). (You can also take the bus, but it is not that long of a walk (1 hour)). 

If you like to do some walks in Oslo, follow the Akerselva trail, it is a quite nice walk and you can see a lot of the city.  [Gems along the River](https://www.visitoslo.com/en/articles/akerselva-river/)



## Food
Lots of good options for different food in Oslo, and there are few things that might be nice to know. 

- Tips are not something that is mandatory, so dont feel obligated to tip. 
- Food is generally expensive, as all things in Norway.

Based on a friends list of maps, divided by sections fo


### Asian Cuisine

- [Izakaya](https://izakayaoslo.com/index-eng.html) Classis Izakaya resturnat. Feels like you are in Tokyo, and it has good and reasonable food. Probably my favorite restaurant in Oslo. A bit difficult to find as there are no official signs or other markings. Also, no way to reserve a table. It is worth waiting for, for sure.
- [Kanpai](https://www.kanpai.no/) is Also an Izakay-style resturant. Also quite good but more posh. You can reserve it. 
- [Hrminir Ramen](https://book.dinnerbooking.com/no/nb-NO/book/index/1838/22) Good ramen place, close to Løkka.
- [SydOst](https://www.sudost.no/booking) SEA  (South East Asian) Food. 

### Western 
I am using Singapore slang for Western food, although the cuisine from these places is more than steaks, fries and some coleslaw (Do not forget the beans).
- [Apostrophe](https://www.restaurant-apostrophe.com/) has Splendid service, excellent food, very nice location. If it is warm enough, sit outside and enjoy the fantastic location.

#### Norweigan Traditional Food
- Kaffistova
- Cafe Schrøder
- Smalhans
- Stortorvet Gjæstgiveri
- Lorry


### Mich


- [Haralds Vaffel](https://www.haraldsvaffel.no/) Really nice to grab an authentic Haralds Vaffel and enjoy very authentic Norwegian Vaffel.
- [King Falafel](https://no.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190479-d15850818-Reviews-King_Falafel-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html) Vegan options.
- [Oslo Street Food](https://www.oslo-streetfood.no/) It is actually quite expensive, but lots of options.  I really like the Japanese street food, which reminds me of Singapore. 
- [Njokobok](https://www.oslo-streetfood.no/): Very cool atmosphere. Senegalese food.
- [Hei Solvik](https://heisolvik.no/) is a long way away from the rest of oslo, but if you have a bike and some time you can bicycle there and enjoy a nice meal in the island. It is a bit far away and closes at around 18, so best for luncheon.

# Thoughts 
- Oslo is like a mini Copenhagen. 
- Exploit the nature.
