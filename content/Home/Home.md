# Home


This is where I want to write about how I live at home and the amenities and tips and tricks I want to share that have worked for me. 



# [Kitchen](../Food/Kitchen.md)
All things cooking and kitchen-related are in its own article. 


# Bedroom

Make sure you invest in your sleep; it is extremely important and some of the most important investments you are making will be into having quality sleep. 


- Invest in good linens, a good bed and comfortable stuff to sleep in. 
- Make sure that your bedroom is dark and only used for sleeping. 

Those are quite obvious, but I repeat them here regardless.
