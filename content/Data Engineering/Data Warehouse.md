# Data Warehouse

When talking about a data warehouse, data lakehouse or data lake, it mostly refers to having a common place to store, manipulate and apply data. 

Why is this important? It provides a common place for all types of data-related work and makes it better for data scientists and data engineers to actually do their jobs. 
From a personal perspective, my read on data warehouses is that it is a must if you want to apply data science and machine learning (traditional is the most likely). As a data scientist, it makes working and understanding data so much easier. So, if a company wants to get serious when it comes to data, then a data warehouse. 


### Data Lake
As data storage costs have fallen dramatically, there has been a movement to create data lakes, aka just throwing all types of files and data into a big ass lake and hoping that it might be useful. I understand the sentiment, but I feel like this is some sort of hoarder mentality of thinking it might be useful. 



## Microsoft Fabric
Microsoft Fabric is like an MS copy of data warehouses such as Snowflake and Databricks; it is more of a comprehensive platform with more to offer. In good MS [EEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) (Embrace-Extend-Extinguish) spirit, it is incompatible, developer-unfriendly and halfway done. But hey, you get good integration with PowerBI so totally worth it (Sarkasm).
