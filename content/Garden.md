# The Garden

Welcome to my Digital Garden.  Here, I try to gather my personal knowledge and share it in the best way I know how. This not only helps me learn while working but is also a helpful place for me to gain knowledge and insights, as well as constantly review what I have done to improve each section. The garden might grow new branches, but adding more is not necessarily what I would like to accomplish, I would also like to prune and grow the branches I have. The growth, like in nature should be organic. 


The garden is by no means a finished work, even my publications of articles are somewhat sketchy, as I have often published unfinished articles that might even be a dummy. However, it is all part of the process of writing and discovering. It is a garden, not a building; it should let its ihabitants live and grow and die naturally. 

As of August 25, 2025, the garden contains 321 files and 30,608 lines of text. The garden has 958 links to internal and external sites.
## What is a Garden
A garden is not a blog, it is not a memo either, it is a place where i can gradually evolve and grow my knowledge. For me it is the continuous development and evolution of my knowledge. Like a tree, needs light to grow, and will branch out where my curiosity shines. Sometimes things must be deleted and replaced as well, and I must prune my knowledge.
