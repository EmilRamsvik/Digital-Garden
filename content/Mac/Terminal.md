# Warp 
I started using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) in May 2022, and it quickly became my terminal of choice. I find the most difficult thing when using the terminal is that it is often difficult to remember commands even though I "know" what I want to do. Warp is amazing at solving this gap by using AI capabilities and natural language to make doing terminal tasks easier. 

[Warp-AI Is good for debugging and understanding code more.](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-ai)
[I use AI Command Search with natural language if I don't specifically know what to do](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-ai/ai-command-search)
I do think warp is a wonderful tool, and it has helped me considerably in quickly navigating and doing regex-like behavior. It is so much easier to just use natural language to write commands in the terminal.

# Thoughts 
- I like warp because I can use natural language to fix almost anything. It is a good send for remembering quick things. 
- I dislike the autocomplete functionality in Warp. It is a bit cumbersome. 
- The dot (.) in front of a directory name implies that it is a hidden directory. Hidden directories are not displayed by default when listing the contents of a directory. They are often used to store configuration files or other files that are not intended to be directly accessed by users.
