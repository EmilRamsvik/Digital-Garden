# Mac
I switched from Windows to Mac in 2021 and used it privately until 2022 when I switched to a Mac for work as well. 

I consider the switch one of the best technical career moves ever. 

Sometimes, I feel a bit overwhelmed by functionalities that I don't use and am not familiar with.  It happens quite a lot that some random functionality, the hot corners come as a good example here just interrupts my flow. 


## Apps

### [Tomatobar](https://github.com/ivoronin/TomatoBar)

A simple toolbar for doing the Pomodoro technique. Kinda neat. 

### [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
Rectangle is for window management, I use it together with [Karabiner](Karabiner.md) to resize and set up window management quickly. I have about 3 or 4 different hotkeys for this. 

### [Bear](https://bear.app/)
Bear is a markdown editor. 
It is nice to have as an alternative to [Obsidian](Obsidian.md) and one of the reasons I quite like it is because it is easy for me to just have it and only it as a writing tool. It is on a freemium plan, and to be honest, the feature I was looking for, the ability to export to .pdf formats, is quite bad.  
- I stopped using bear and instead went only obsidian. 
- [The Hemmingway App might be an interesting alternative](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

- [Mac Automation course]( https://macos.nikiv.dev/) is a Paid course, but if you would like to automate can recommend it. I used this and other resources to automate a lot of the work I have done.  

# Thoughts 
- The M# chips have made performance quite irrelevant. I think the AirBook is as good as a MacBook Pro. As a data scientist, I have seen the move from local machine learning training to working on a more cloud-based level, so I do not really see the difference.
