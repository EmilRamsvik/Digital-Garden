### We are Always Being Manipulated



 Every single day, whether we step out to walk the dog, go to the store, or scroll on our phones, we are being manipulated by someone, and this is an unfortunate fact of life. We must understand that everyone has an agenda and a way of getting something from us—whether it's our money, our attention, our time, or our actions. We need to understand that this is an integral part of life.

I think one of the greatest strengths you can have in daily life is understanding not only how other people, animals, or systems try to manipulate you, but also how your own body tries to manipulate you. Try to figure out how you can ensure that this manipulation—although not necessarily a bad thing—is there for a reason, and you need to decide if that reason is good enough for you to accept it.

### Here are some tricks to cope with the manipulation
- When buying stuff at groceries, have a list of things you need, and do not deviate from that list. Have a system of routine for buing things, consider maybe having a delivery service for common items (Toilet paper, sparkling water, other things)
- Do not use notifications on social media.
