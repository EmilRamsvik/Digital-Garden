I like to have an orderly home but with a soul. A home is a reflection of who you are and the experiences you have had. 

The things you have reflect the decisions you have made before, and they accumulate. 


I am not a fan of too much *stuff*. It is an easy trap to just think I should keep it as it *might* be useful.

## Living Room


## Bedroom
Keep the bedroom nice and tidy, focus on the fact that a bedroom is there for sleeping.
