# Coffee

Coffee is probably the drug I am most comfortable using. Caffeine is something I am definitely addicted to, and I am comfortable with that. 

Filter coffee works great, I have primarily used the standard [Moccamaster](https://www.jernia.no/inspirasjon/nordmenns-favoritt-kaffetrakter-i-50-ar/) filter machine. It works great and I am very happy with it. 

Lombok coffee and [Turkish coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee) are great when you don't have any equipment but don't want to use instant coffee.

# Thoughts 
- In Singapore and Malaysia, coffee goes by Kopi.
- Interesting to notice the withdrawal symptoms approximately 24 hours after the last coffee, it is usually a headache that differs from other headaches.
