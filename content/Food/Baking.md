# Baking

Baking is a bit different from cooking. Cooking is art, but baking is more of a science. 

## Tangzhou
In short, the tangzhong method involves cooking a small amount of the recipe’s flour and liquid to form a thick slurry, which is then mixed with the rest of the ingredients to make a basic bread dough.
This process pre-gelatinizes the starches in the flour, and as a result, they can absorb more liquid. The result? More moisture in the dough translates to a softer texture in the baked bread and a longer shelf life.

# Sourdough

*Levain* - Levain is a type of natural yeast used in baking, particularly in the making of sourdough bread. It's a mixture of flour and water that has been fermented over a period of time. This fermentation process allows the growth of wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria naturally present in the flour and the surrounding environment.

The yeast in the levain causes the dough to rise, while the lactic acid bacteria give the bread its distinctive sour flavor. The process of maintaining a levain involves regular "feedings" of additional flour and water to keep the yeast and bacteria alive and active.

Levain, also known as a sourdough starter or simply "starter, " is a traditional method of leavening bread that predates the use of commercial yeast. Many bakers prefer using levain because it enhances the bread's flavor, texture, and shelf life.

# Thoughts 
- Levain bread is actually used a lot in Sweden, which I found interesting. 
- If you read this, make some scones and tea today and share with a loved one. 
- Making bread is difficult, but extremely important to be clear on ratios. 
- Use a measurement in weight. Important.
