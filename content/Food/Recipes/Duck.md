# Duck
Duck is one of the better ways of making haute cuisine food. And I very much prefer the French way of cooking duck. 


Duck, roasted potatoes and Broccolini is one of my favourites. I use the apple sauce from Marco Pierre White´s recipe as a sauce. Honey-glazed duck is an all-time favourite.
