# Maqlouba

# Description
Maqlouba means upside down in Arabic. It is quite easy to work with.  Actually, quite an easy dish to make for a lot of people, I might have spent around and hour maybe 90 minutes on it. 
### How I discovered it. 
I worked a lot with a Palestinian friend and it was easy to get going. Made it for a bunch of people

# Ingredients

* Chicken
* Basmati rice
* Eggplant
* Potatoes
* Onions
* Garlic
* Dates for having on the side.
### Condiments
- Salt and pepper of course
- Chicken stock
- Maqlouba spice mix
- Tumeric for coloring the rice
### Equipment 
* Dutch oven
# Instructions
Make sure to wash the rice. Brown the chicken in oil, fry the veggies after, and add water and chicken stock. Then add the chicken back in.  Add the spice and let it simmer.  
Then cook the rice with turmeric for colour.  Then add the rice to the top, when serving, have a large baking pan and turn the dutch oven on its head, then carefully remove it. 
## Serving 
Served upside down. 

# Thoughts
- You can steak the veggies in the oven, and then add them later.
