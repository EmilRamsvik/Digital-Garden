# Osso Bucco

# Description
Osso Buco is a traditional Italian dish that consists of braised veal shanks cooked with vegetables, white wine, and broth. The name "osso buco" translates to "bone with a hole" in English, which is a reference to the marrow-filled bone in the center of the veal shank.

The dish is a classic of Lombard cuisine, hailing from the northern Italian region of Lombardy. More specifically, it is often associated with the city of Milan. There are two main variations of Osso Buco: "alla Milanese," which includes a gremolata (a garnish made from lemon zest, garlic, and parsley) and typically does not include tomatoes, and a more modern version which includes tomatoes and omits the gremolata.

Osso Buco is traditionally served with either risotto alla Milanese or polenta, depending on the region. The marrow in the bone is considered a delicacy and is often eaten with a small spoon.

As for its origins, like many traditional dishes, the exact history is somewhat unclear. It is believed to have been developed in the 19th century, but it's possible that similar dishes were being made much earlier. The dish became popular outside of Italy in the 20th century, especially in the U.S. in cities with large Italian immigrant populations.

- Finely chopped parsley
- Grated lemon zestÂ 
- Grated garlic

It needs the basic[ holy trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cooking)) with a shit-ton of the pope (garlic) as well. It is smart to do some prep work cutting it up beforehand.

# Thoughts

- I think using veal skanks is, of course, the best, but I think this dish is also very good with lamb as well. 
- If you can make it in the morning and let it simmer or be in the oven at low temparature then that is best. Gives the stew time to
