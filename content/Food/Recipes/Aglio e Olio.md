# Aglio e Olio
# Description
Pasta *aglio e olio* (Pasta with Garlic and Olive Oil) is a simple vegetarian pasta dish
### How I discovered it. 
I think I randomly discovered it when I first discovered Binging with Babish's youtube channel. 


# Ingredients

* Garlic, lots of it
* Lemon - Like one should be enough for two. 
* Pasta, spaghetti is the best pasta for this type of pasta. Like 300 grams is enough for two if you are not too hungry. More than that is usually too much and leads to leftovers. 
* Parsley - Half a bush on the store should be enough.


Cut up the garlic before starting cooking, and boil up the pasta water with salt (Not oil you heathen). Might cut up the parsley as well.  It is smart to have all the prep done before starting to brown the garlic. 
Serve it up like John Favraue in Chef, use a carving fort to do the prep on the plate. 

# Thoughts
- Been a stable dinner choice for a while now. A vegetarian option that tastes delicious. Quick and dirty dish.
- The garlic is best when chopped so that the slices are as long as possible. Makes it easier to eat
- You can add the garlic while heating the pan; not an issue. 
- Usually, it is an issue with too little garlic. Don't be conservative here; almost a whole clove for a person. At least a clove per 2 persons. 
- Usually a very good date night option. In my experience, I never ordered this at a restaurant but the homemade version is gold.
