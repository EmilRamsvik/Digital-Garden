# Food



# Cooking 

One of the most important and fun aspects of cooking is the ability to explore outside of a set recipe. This exploration phase is what makes cooks great. Here is a list of questions for the aspiring cook. 

- What is the purpose of each ingredient?
- What is the scientific background for each action you do? Why are you applying heat to the meat, what is the purpose? 
- What does each ingredient taste like? 
- How often do you taste the food while you work?
- Do you measure each ingredient? Why?

### Prefabricated or bottom up. 
I learned to cook from my mother, and despite some bad habits (such as refusing to have a clean kitchen), I learned a lot about food and preparation. The most important lesson is understanding that if you take time to invest in yourself and your skills, making things from the bottom up can be almost as fast as making some pre-fabricated stuff, if you know how and is mindful. 
## Useful condiments

Useful condiments that should be in a kitchen makes versatile and from the ground-up food. 
- Salt that is easily accessible
- Olive oil
- Soy sauce
- Pepper
- Cooking oil

- *Balsamic Vinegar*

	A common tip is to get the best cold-pressed olive oil and old balsamic vinegar, combine them in a bowl, and dip fresh bread in it.

### Super Quick Sauce that is Awesome
When cooking fish or searing meat in a pan, don't throw away the burnt stuff at the bottom of the pan. 
1. Add some shallots and garlic, maybe some capers or other aromatics
2. After it is cooked, deglaze the pan with some wine (Depending, but white wine is a good suggestion.) You can use other things, such as stock if there is not a wish to use alcohol. 
3. Reduce the sauce, aka cook it and damp away the liquid
4. To finish up, add a big stick of butter. The sauce should be thicker after the butter. 
5. Enjoy

- Tarragon is the fish's friend.

# Thoughts 
- Don't be afraid to go outside the recipes, especially when cooking; you will never be good if you never fail. 
- Focus on the fundamentals; one of my greatest advantages is that I quickly prepare ingredients and knife work. The disadvantage is that in order to be the greatest asset, 
- Being good at knife work makes you seem like a pro. Very funny. 
- I have been to a couple of food cooking classes in my life, and usually, people ask me if I am a professional. This is, of course, because I look the part when prepping food. 
- I think the journey for me, and I truly believe that this is a good route to go is: 
	- In childhood and adolescence, you need to learn the principles and be allowed to fail and learn. How to cook things, how to prep things, and the value of understanding the ingredients and their purpose. 
	- When moving for yourself at university, gain confidence, and knowledge, and skill by making a lot of food cheaply and effectively. Meal prepping for me was very helpful. 
	- When getting a job with some income, you can focus on *haute cuisine*, mastering the advanced and complicated aspects of cooking.
