# General thoughts on podcasts

I think podcasts are a cool way of getting to know more, it has some similar attributes to lectures in a way that information is vocally submitted. 



## Long-form Podcasts

I particularly like the long-form format on podcasts. One thing I like is that usually the hosts do not play a big part and you can hear new perspectives. Usually, the host is not that important. 

One thing I believe is important to understand when it comes to podcasts is the [Gell-Mann Amnesia](https://www.epsilontheory.com/gell-mann-amnesia/) syndrome (Also a good link to the phenomenon [here](https://hypercritical.co/2023/08/18/the-plumber-problem)). I almost think that this is inevitable in the form of long-form podcasts. 
I think you need to have your skeptic glasses on full-time because the hosts of those podcasts would never do that. To be fair to the podcast hosts, it is very difficult to fact-check everything. However, be aware of hosts like Joe Rogan that are not challenging anything the guest says, more or less. 

# True Stories podcasts
There are some good true crime podcast episodes that I have found very enchanting. However, it should be noted that some of the true story podcasts such as true crime have gotten some criticism.


## Podcasts that I like

### [Big Technology Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4ln6H9peIXhq19yv3CdOvE?si=592021bd4ede4b99)
Alex and Ranjan are not only capable but also fun to hear about. Reading Ranjan RoyÂ´s articles about ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) was formative, and I enjoy his views and feel they are nuanced and calm. I like that both of them like to disagree and often argue about stuff. It is very technology-focused, which aligns with my interests. Furthermore, Alex usually has some good guests to interview. 

### [Business Books & Co](https://open.spotify.com/show/3AHsPplOB57xM25RtJwYQg?si=2b53b4fbb451425b)
Discussions around popular business books. The hosts are good at describing the contents of the books and it feels like you get about 80 % of the contents of the books through each episode. It is also good to hear some criticisms of the books to stay a bit neutral. 

### [Latent Space](https://open.spotify.com/show/2p7zZVwVF6Yk0Zsb4QmT7t?si=bda2e2b96be142a0)
This is about AI engineering. Very good. Especially for IT engineers wanting to explore the AI engineering space. This is a good starting point. 

Especially liked the episodes on [datasets](https://open.spotify.com/episode/23x4LKlYGaULX2bw5yVhrU?si=9724c8d7af58423f) and [benchmarks](https://open.spotify.com/episode/16vo3YLUTZI0nwAbrhjWYT?si=566051b5746b42b7)

### [Complex Systems](https://open.spotify.com/show/3Mos4VE3figVXleHDqfXOH?si=87845761654947e9) 
I really like the theme and topics on this IT and How the World Works podcast. 

### [We have ways of making you talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/34VlAepHmeloDD76RX4jtc?si=a4713a9fc9a74453)
A funny history podcast.
