# General thoughts on podcasts

I think podcasts are a cool way of getting to know more, it has some similar attributes to lectures in a way that information is vocally submitted. 



## Long-form Podcasts

I particularly like the long-form format on podcasts. One thing I like is that usually the hosts do not play a big part and you can hear new perspectives. Usually, the host is not that important. 

One thing I believe is important to understand when it comes to podcasts is the [Gell-Mann Amnesia](https://www.epsilontheory.com/gell-mann-amnesia/) syndrome. I almost think that this is inevitable in the form of long-form podcasts. 
I think you need to have your skeptic glasses on full-time because the hosts of those podcasts would never do that. To be fair to the podcast hosts, it is very difficult to fact check everything. However, be aware of hosts like Joe Rogan that is not challenging anything the guest say, more or less. 

# True Stories podcasts
There are some good true crime podcast episodes that I have found very enchanting. However, it should be noted that some of the true story podcasts such as true crime have gotten some criticism.
