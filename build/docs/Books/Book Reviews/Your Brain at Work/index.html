<p>This book is about how you can understand and work on your performance by understanding how the brain works. The book goes through different scenarios and explains why the persons in the scenario do what they do and what they can do to achieve better results.  The book contains helpful hints about how to &quot;hack&quot; your brain to achieve better results and improve your life.</p>
<h1>🎨 Impressions</h1>
<p>I quite liked it and felt it was a good overview of how the different ways the brain. It was a nice summary of the current status of the science of the brain and performance. It contained a lot of interesting insights about the brain and how it might lead you down some slippery paths.</p>

<p>I read about the book in a blog post, but cannot remember which one, unfortunately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-should-read-it">Who Should Read It?<a href="#who-should-read-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who Should Read It?" title="Direct link to Who Should Read It?">​</a></h2>
<p>I think everyone who is interested in neuroscience and performance in work, relationships, and focus would have great use of this.</p>
<h1>☘️ How the Book Changed Me</h1>
<p>I think I will return to the book a lot more and try to incorporate science in order to perform better in all aspects of my life. Especially, how I can distance myself from petty impulses and emotions and become a better person.</p>
<h1>✍️ My Top  Quotes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>More people than ever are being paid to think, instead of just doing routine tasks. Yet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>While the brain is exquisitely powerful, even the brain of a Harvard graduate can be turned into that of an eight-year-old simply by being made to do two things at once.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>These five functions, understanding, deciding, recalling, memorizing, and inhibiting, make up the majority of conscious thought and are recombined to plan, problem-solve, communicate, and other tasks. Each function uses the prefrontal cortex intensively and requires significant resources to operate,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conscious mental activities chew up metabolic resources, the fuel in your blood, significantly faster than automatic brain functions such as how your brain helps keep your heart beating or your lungs breathing. The stage requires a lot of energy to function.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The first clinical evidence for this limitation came way back in 1898. The scientist J. C. Welsh measured people’s ability to do physical tasks while thinking. She had subjects start a mental task and then asked them to impose as much force as they could, at the same time, on a dynamometer, a machine for measuring force. Her measurements showed that almost all mental tasks reduced maximum force, often by as much as 50 percent.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If Emily knew how energy-hungry her stage was, she would start her Monday morning differently. The big difference is she would prioritize prioritizing. She would prioritize first, before any other attention-rich activity such as emailing. That’s because prioritizing is one of the brain’s most energy-hungry processes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This partly explains why people spend more time thinking about problems (things they have seen) than solutions (things they have never seen). It explains why setting goals feels so hard (it’s hard to envision the future). Daniel Gilbert’s 2006 book, Stumbling on Happiness, dives deeply into the implications of this finding, illustrating how human beings are terrible at estimating emotions in the future, a concept he calls affective forecasting.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gilbert shows how people define how they will feel in the future based more on the way they feel today, instead of correctly assessing the mental state they might be in at a future date. That’s because it’s difficult.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Like the coding used on the ski slopes for the degree of difficulty, there are mental tasks that are green, blue, and black. Prioritizing, at least in a knowledge economy full of conceptual projects, is definitely a black run, perhaps even a double black diamond. Do it when you are fresh and energized, or you might crash and burn down the hill.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This tendency means scheduling the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind. This could be early in the morning, or perhaps after a break or exercise. The prefrontal cortex has much in common with other energy-hungry body parts such as muscles. It tires from use, and can do a lot more after a good rest. Making a tough decision might take thirty seconds when you are fresh and be impossible when you’re not.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One final insight about prioritizing involves getting disciplined about what you don’t put on the stage. This means not thinking when you don’t have to, becoming disciplined about not paying attention to non-urgent tasks unless, or until, it’s truly essential that you do. Learning to say no to mental tasks that are not among your priorities is difficult but very helpful. Another technique for thinking less about unnecessary tasks is to delegate well.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Another technique is not to think at all about a project until all the information is at hand. Don’t waste energy solving a problem you know you will have more information about later.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Conscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.</li>
<li>Every time the brain works on an idea consciously, it uses up a measurable and limited resource.</li>
<li>Some mental processes take up a lot more energy than others.</li>
<li>The most important mental processes, such as prioritizing, often take the most effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Some Things to Try</em>
<ul>
<li>Think of conscious thinking as a precious resource to conserve. Prioritize prioritizing, as it’s an energy-intensive activity.</li>
<li>Save mental energy for prioritizing by avoiding other high-energy consuming conscious activities such as dealing with emails.</li>
<li>Schedule the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind.</li>
<li>Use the brain to interact with information rather than trying to store information, by creating visuals for complex ideas and by listing projects.</li>
<li>Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p><em>Paul has hit a second limit of the prefrontal cortex here: there’s a limit to how much information can be held in mind and manipulated at any one time. That’s because the stage is small, smaller than generally acknowledged. To make a series of important decisions this morning, Paul has to quickly make sense of a huge amount of information.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The stage is small, much smaller than commonly realized.</li>
<li>The less you hold in mind at once the better.</li>
<li>New concepts take up more space on the stage than ideas you know well.</li>
<li>Memory starts to degrade when you try to hold more than one idea in mind.</li>
<li>When trying to make a decision between items, the optimal number of items to compare is two. The optimal number of different ideas to hold in mind at one time is no more than three or four, ideally three.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify information by approximating and focusing on an idea’s salient elements.</li>
<li>Group information into chunks whenever you have too much information.</li>
<li>Practice getting your most important actors onstage first, not just the ones that are easiest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This idea that conscious processes need to be done one at a time has been studied in hundreds of experiments since the 1980s. For example, the scientist Harold Pashler showed that when people do two cognitive tasks at once, their cognitive capacity can drop from that of a Harvard MBA to that of an eight-year-old. It’s a phenomenon called dual-task interference.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The lesson is clear: if accuracy is important, don’t divide your attention.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The problem isn’t doing two things at once so much as doing two conscious mental tasks at once, unless you are okay with a significant drop in performance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“To pay continuous partial attention is to keep a top-level item in focus, and constantly scan the periphery in case something more important emerges.”</em></p>
</li>

<p><em>What people tend to do is what Emily tried to do in the meeting. They try to hold several focuses at once and switch rapidly between them. You might think this is a fine idea. But consider what happens when you hold tasks in the background. Given your small working memory, you decrease the amount of data that can be held for what you want to focus on at any moment. Instead of four items on the stage at once, you may be down to three, or even just two. Space is being taken up in working memory for the items held just off the stage.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1908, scientists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson discovered a fact about human performance that they called the inverted U. They found that performance was poor at low levels of stress, hit a sweet spot at reasonable levels of stress, and tapered off under high stress. The verb stress means “to emphasize,” and it’s not necessarily a negative thing. It’s wrong to think your performance would improve if stress disappeared from your life. It takes a certain amount of stress just to get out of bed in the morning. This type of stress is known as eustress, or positive stress. Positive stress helps focus your attention.</em></p>

<p><em>Putting aside stimulants such as caffeine (which is, like a bigger computer screen, a proven technique for increasing mental performance), there are two main strategies for increasing arousal.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One strategy, perhaps the easiest and quickest, is to increase adrenaline levels by bringing “urgency” to a task. Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is the brain equivalent of the adrenaline most people feel before public speaking. It’s the chemistry of fear. When you are scared, you pay intense attention; you are highly alert. Fear brings a deep and immediate alertness. Norepinephrine also turns out to be important for binding circuits together in the prefrontal cortex. You can play various “tricks” on yourself to generate the release of this chemical. Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it. One study found that picturing yourself doing a finger exercise increased muscle mass by 22 percent, which was close to the 30 percent achieved by doing the exercise for real.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scientists have also found that expecting a positive event, anything the brain perceives as a reward, generates dopamine. Rewards to the brain include food, sex, money, and positive social interactions. So Paul could have put his prefrontal cortex into the right neurochemical sweet spot by focusing on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way.</em></p>

<li>Because we perceive ourselves using the same circuits we use when perceiving others, you can trick your brain into a status reward by playing against yourself.</li>
<li>Playing against yourself increases your status without threatening others.</li>
<li>Status is one of five major social domains that are all either primary rewards or threats, which form the SCARF model for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Watch out for people’s status being threatened.</li>
<li>Reduce status threats in others by lowering your status through sharing your own humanity or mistakes.</li>
<li>Reduce status threats in others by giving people positive feedback.</li>
<li>Find ways to play against yourself, and pay a lot of attention to any incremental improvements.</li>
<li>The slightest feeling of improvement can generate a pleasant and helpful reward.</li>
<li>Playing against yourself to improve your understanding of your own brain can be a powerful way of increasing your performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><em>Giving others feedback is often the first strategy people use to facilitate change. Yet, surprisingly, giving feedback is rarely the right way to create real change. While there are many “techniques” to improve the performance of feedback, people miss the basic reality of this approach: feedback creates a strong threat for people in most situations.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paul’s first attempt to help Eric involved a “polite” approach to giving feedback: he said something nice, then attacked Eric’s status, and then said something nice again. To me this is like an “arsenic sandwich”: the bread might make the meal appear more palatable, but it’s still going to kill you.</em></p>

<p><em>“Performance review.” Mike Morrison, at the time the dean of Toyota University in Los Angeles, commented that annual performance reviews, “Essentially just reduce performance for six days each year: three days while people prepare for it, and three days recovering from it.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ohlsson finds that when someone hits an impasse, telling her what not to think tends to help only 5 percent of the time. Giving people clues about what they should think about tends to help only 8 percent of the time.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As people are often already anxious when stuck at an impasse, and anxiety generally makes people’s views narrow and their brains noisier, it’s important to reduce people’s anxiety and increase their positive emotions—in other words, to shift them from an away state to a toward state. A great way to do this is using elements of the SCARF model. You could help the person increase her sense of status, perhaps by encouraging her. Or increase someone’s sense of certainty by making implicit issues more explicit, say, by clarifying your objectives. Or increase a person’s sense of autonomy by ensuring that he is making the decisions and coming up with the ideas, not just listening to your suggestions.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What you are doing is facilitating in others the ARIA model (Awareness, Reflection, Insight, and Action), which I introduced back in scene 6, as a fast way of getting past impasses.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When you review your own work, there’s an incentive to convince yourself that the work is good. You don’t want to look bad to another person. Eric, for example, is convinced he’s done nothing wrong with the school project, especially when Paul thinks he might have.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Asking someone else for permission to stretch their thinking can create a nice positive flush from a sense of increased status and autonomy.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving feedback often creates an intense threat response that doesn’t help people improve performance.</li>
<li>The problem-solving approach may not be the most effective pathway to solutions.</li>
<li>Providing suggestions often results in a lot of wasted time. Bringing people to their own insights is a fast way of getting people back on track.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Catch yourself when you go to give feedback, problem solve, or provide solutions.</li>
<li>Help people think about their own thinking by focusing them on their own subtle internal thoughts, without getting into too much detail.</li>
<li>Find ways to make it valuable for people to give themselves feedback; reward them for activating their director.</li>

<p><em>Hebb’s Law, which says that “Cells that fire together, wire together.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As Sir Winston Churchill once said, “I love to learn, but I hate to be taught.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“There are toward goals and away goals,” Barrell explains, “and which one you use has quite an impact on performance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Toward goals have you visualize and create connections around where you are going. You are creating new connections. What’s interesting is you start to feel good at lower levels with toward goals. There are benefits earlier. Away goals have you visualize what can go wrong, which reactivates the emotions involved.” The trouble is, because problems come to mind so much easier than solutions, people are always setting away goals instead of toward goals. Also, problems are more certain than unknown solutions, and the brain naturally steers toward certainty. For these reasons and more, toward goals are rare, and setting them might require getting some help from someone else, such as a mentor or coach.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When you set an away goal, you can end up paying attention to the negative emotions instead of making new connections. Lose weight, stop smoking, don’t drink: most of the New Year’s resolutions of the world are away goals.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The term “attention density,” coined by Jeffrey M. Schwartz, provides a scientific framework for future research about repeated attention. This density can be measured with such variables as frequency, duration, and intensity of attention. This looks like measuring how often you recall an idea, how long each time, and with how much focus.</em></p>

<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>While human change appears hard, change in the brain is constant.</li>
<li>Focused attention changes the brain.</li>
<li>Attention goes all too easily to the threat. Once you focus attention away from threat, you can create new connections with the right questions.</li>
<li>Creating long-term change requires paying regular attention to deepen new circuits, especially when they are new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Practice watching for people’s emotional state when you want to facilitate change.</li>
<li>Don’t try to influence people when they are in a strong away state.</li>
<li>Use elements of the SCARF model to shift people into a toward state.</li>
<li>Practice using solution-focused questions that focus people’s attention directly on the specific circuits you want to bring to life.</li>
<li>Invent ways to have people pay repeated attention to new circuits.</li>
