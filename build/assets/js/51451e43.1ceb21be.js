The way we evolved to hunt wild game may help explain why we find ourselves compelled to use certain products today. In Africa, the chase begins when a group of San hunters separate a large kudu bull from the herd. The animal\u2019s heavy antlers slows him down, making him less agile than the female kudus. Once the animal is isolated from the pack, a single San hunter begins the hunt, keeping a steady pace as the animal leaps ahead in fear. At first, it appears the man will never catch up to the bounding beast. At times he struggles to keep the animal in sight through the dry brush. But the hunter knows he can use the animal\u2019s weaknesses to his advantage. The powerful kudu is much faster in short sprints, but the kudu\u2019s skin is covered with fur and can not dissipate heat like the runner\u2019s skin can. According to Lieberman, \u201cQuadrupeds can not pant and gallop at the same time.\u201d[lxxxiii] So while the kudu must stop to catch his breath, the hunter begins closing in, not to catch it but to run it to exhaustion.
