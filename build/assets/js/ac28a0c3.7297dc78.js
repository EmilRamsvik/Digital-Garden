In other words, a side effect is any observable change outside of the function scope that happens as a result of a function call. An example of such side effects could be the modification of a global variable, the modification of an attribute of an object that is available outside of the function scope, or saving data to some external service. Side effects are the core of the concept of OOP, where class instances are objects that are used to encapsulate the state of an application, and methods are functions bound to those objects that are supposed to manipulate the state of these objects. Procedural programming also heavily relies on side effects. Referential transparency: When a function or expression is referentially transparent, it can be replaced with the value that corresponds to its output without changing the behavior of the program. So, a lack of side effects is a requirement for referential transparency, but not every function that lacks side effects is a referentially transparent function. For instance, Python's built-in pow(x, y) function is referentially transparent, because it lacks side effects, and for every x and y argument, it can be replaced with the value of xy. On the other hand, the datetime.now() constructor method of the datetime type does not seem to have any observable side effects but will return a different value every time it is called. So, it is referentially opaque. Pure functions: A pure function is a function that does not have any side effects and that always returns the same value for the same set of input arguments. In other words, it is a function that is referentially transparent. Every mathematical function is, by definition, a pure function. Analogously, a function that leaves a trace of its execution for the outside world (for instance, by modifying received objects) is not a pure function. First-class functions: Language is said to contain first-class functions if functions in this language can be treated as any other value or entity. First-class functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as function return values, and assigned to variables. In other words, a language that has first-class functions is a language that treats functions as first-class citizens. Functions in Python are first-class functions."})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.li,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.em,{children:"from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass(frozen=True) class FrozenVector: x: int y: int Such a frozen Vector data class becomes completely immutable, so you won't be able to modify any of its attributes.
