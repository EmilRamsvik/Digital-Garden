  "description": "This book is for the naturalist and realists that are concerned about the environment. It goes through the most critical things that drive our modern society, cement, steel, ammonia and plastic, and goes through what it takes to produce said elements. You don't get that enthusiastic about a zero-oil society by reading it.",
