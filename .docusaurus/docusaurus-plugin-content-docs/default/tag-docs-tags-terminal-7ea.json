      "description": "I started using Warp in May 2022, and it quickly became my terminal of choice. I find the most difficult thing when using the terminal is that it is often difficult to remember commands even though I \"know\" what I want to do. Warp is amazing at solving this gap by using AI capabilities and natural language to make doing terminal tasks easier.",
