The goal of the ML Design Sprint is to decide on the goal of the model, the input features of the model, and how the model should be evaluated. The design sprint brings together Subject Matter Experts, Users, Product Owners Data Scientists, and ML Engineers together to quickly understand the problem, the potential solutions, and the risks. ML Design Sprint should shorten the duration of the scoping and exploratory analysis phases by bringing the analysts and experts together.",
