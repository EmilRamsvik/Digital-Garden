  "description": "Rights are made by and for humans, and can by definition therefore also be taken away from them. We create rights by fighting, bleeding and dying for them to be made and upheld. This is true for all major events where mankind has lept from darkness and abuse to a tiny bit lighter society.  By having rights, you in turn have to accept the responsibility of upholding those rights for yourself and also others.",
