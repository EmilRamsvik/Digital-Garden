By having rights, you in turn have to accept the responsibility of upholding those rights for yourself and also others.",

He delves into the absurd scenarios in 1984 and Animal Farm and highlights the same exact scenarios from real-life scenarios.  Imperialism, Fascism, and Communism, the great calamities of the 19th century, are shown through the lens of Orwell, and also how he always lands on the right side of history.",
