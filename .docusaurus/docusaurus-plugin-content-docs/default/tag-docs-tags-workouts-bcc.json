      "description": "I started strength training when I was 17, and did some on and off until I was 19. From 19 to 24, I consistently worked out between 3 and 5 days a week.  I did a lot of failing and needed a lot of guidance during that period. First of all, I started with only upper body exercises and neglected to work out my legs for quite a while. I think this was because I was not flexible enough to do the squat exercises correctly. In hindsight, it is difficult to assess in hindsight what the causation for the lack of leg exercises, but I am certain the lack of flexibility made doing leg workouts quite a bit difficult.",
