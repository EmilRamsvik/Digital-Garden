      "title": "Data Drift",
      "description": "Data drift refers to the phenomenon where the statistical properties of a dataset used for machine learning or analysis change over time. This alteration can be due to various factors such as shifts in data collection processes, changes in the underlying distribution of the data, or modifications in the environment from which the data originates. Detecting and addressing data drift is crucial to maintaining the performance and reliability of machine learning models and analytical systems.",

The goal of the ML Design Sprint is to decide on the goal of the model, the input features of the model, and how the model should be evaluated. The design sprint brings together Subject Matter Experts, Users, Product Owners Data Scientists, and ML Engineers together to quickly understand the problem, the potential solutions, and the risks. ML Design Sprint should shorten the duration of the scoping and exploratory analysis phases by bringing the analysts and experts together.",
