  "description": "This book systematically cuts through all the bravado and battlefield-centric focus of World War 2 history and focuses on the things that mattered. Manufacturing, logistics, and control over the air-sea theatre. It also provides insight into how the leaders of both the Axis powers as well as the Allies thought and how they argued against themselves, for better or worse.",
