      "description": "This book depicts, from a young boy to a young man's perspective, the journey from Jim Crow South to Chicago and the trials from the communist party. It is a gripping read, where the main character is never comfortable in his environment, constantly struggling for the right to exist as an individual.  Freedom all look the same, but oppression has many faces.",
