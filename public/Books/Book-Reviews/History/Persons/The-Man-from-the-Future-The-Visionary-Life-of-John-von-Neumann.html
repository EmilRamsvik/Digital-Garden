<p>This book is about the fascinating life of John von Neumann. It describes the work and the ramifications of the work he ventured on. Things like game theory, the biology of cell automata, economics, physics, mathematics, and computer science are all fields either founded or drastically influenced by the work of John von Neumann.</p>

<p>I have always had a soft spot for one of the most influential scientists of all time, and I was astonished by the amount of work that was done by John von Neumann.</p>
<p>This book is a goldmine of a story of the scientific and cultural shift from Europe to America, and the golden age of scientific discovery during the first 50 years of the 20th century.</p>

<p>I think this is a good book for anyone who likes to read biographies and is interested in science. It does not contain any math so rest assured, it will be a good read.</p>

<p>It is just so interesting for me to read about how drastic the shift from Europe to America was, it was insane how much brainpower shifted to the Americas. I am astonished about how increasingly effective the purges of intellectuals from Germany by the Nazi party were, they removed most of the tools they had to contribute to their insane war effort.</p>
<p>Also, the tragic fate of some of the characters, such as Godel, Nash, and others, shows the dark side of the human mind and how one should be thankful for not only the gifts one receives but also the curses one does not.

<p><em>‘If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.’ John von Neumann</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘Von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my three-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.’ Edward Teller</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Created when the old capital of Buda was merged with the nearby cities of Óbuda and Pest in 1873, Budapest was thriving.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In 1910, a quarter of Budapest’s population, and more than half of its doctors, lawyers, and bankers, were Jewish, as were many of those involved in the city’s thriving cultural scene.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Equally, von Neumann had no interest in sport and, barring long walks (always in a business suit), he would avoid any form of vigorous physical exercise for the rest of his life. When his second wife, Klári, tried to persuade him to ski, he offered her a divorce.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘Mathematics is the foundation of all exact knowledge of natural phenomena.’ David Hilbert, 1900</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘Johnny’s unique gift as a mathematician was to transform problems in all areas of mathematics into problems of logic,’ says Freeman Dyson.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘My opinions have been violently opposed to Marxism ever since I remember,’ he told a congressional confirmation hearing in 1955, after he was nominated to the Atomic Energy Commission, ‘and quite in particular since I had about a three-month taste of it in Hungary in 1919.’</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Displaying a sensitivity towards the feelings of others that are not always found in those with remarkable brains, von Neumann took care not to be overbearing yet could not but help stand apart. ‘Whenever I talked with von Neumann,’ Wigner said of his friend, ‘I always had the impression that only he was fully awake, that I was halfway in a dream.’</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The next leap forward in geometry was taken by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, about twenty years after Bolyai and Lobachevsky. Riemann’s doctoral thesis, now recognized as one of the greatest ever produced in mathematics, was of a gloriously fertile originality,’ said Carl Friedrich Gauss, the most famous mathematician of the age. While Bolyai and Lobachevsky pictured planes that curved through space, Riemann’s surfaces often twisted and contorted in ways that could barely be imagined at all. His mathematics could describe space with any number of dimensions – hyperspace – just as easily as the three familiar spatial ones. More than half a century later, Riemann’s geometry would prove ‘admirably appropriate’ for describing the warped four-dimensional spacetime of Einstein’s general relativity.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘Ignoramus et ignorabimus,’ as he put it: ‘we do not know and will not know’.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man,’ growled Leopold Kronecker, a contemporary grandee of German mathematics who found Cantor’s juggling with infinities suspicious and distasteful</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>His analysis of the paradox revealed it to be similar in form to several others, including the liar’s paradox (‘this statement is a lie’). ‘It seemed unworthy of a grown man to spend time on such trivialities,’</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In Göttingen, Hilbert reacted angrily. Whereas once he had supported Brouwer’s application for a chair at the University of Amsterdam, he now campaigned for him to be removed from the board of editors of Mathematische Annalen, one of the field’s most prestigious journals. Einstein, one of the editors, dismissed the feud as a completely overblown Froschmäusekrieg (literally a war of frogs and mice, a German phrase describing a bitter but unimportant altercation).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I don’t maintain that I understood everything, but enough to see that this was outstanding work and to recognize ex ungue leonem.’ ‘To know the lion by his claw’ – the Latin words uttered by Johann Bernoulli 200 years earlier, on recognizing by its brilliance an anonymous work by Isaac Newton.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>After 379 pages, Russell and his co-author Alfred North Whitehead were able to prove that 1+1=2 (‘The above proposition is occasionally useful,’ read the wry comment accompanying their proof).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>He was twenty-two. Hilbert, one of the examiners, is alleged to have asked just one question. ‘In all my years I have never seen such beautiful evening clothes: pray, who is the candidate’s tailor?’</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘If only I knew more mathematics!’ Erwin Schrödinger, 1925</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘The more successes the quantum theory enjoys, the more stupid it looks,’ said Einstein, who realized early on that the shotgun wedding of classical and quantum concepts could not last.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The core ideas in Heisenberg’s revolutionary paper were assembled during a two-week stay in June 1925 at Heligoland, a sparsely inhabited rock shaped like a wizard’s hat that lies some 30 miles north of the German coast. Puffed up by a severe attack of hay fever, the outdoorsman had gone to take the pollen-free North Sea air, hiking and swimming and hoping for a breakthrough that would make sense of the puzzles thrown up by Bohr’s work.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>He showed what he described as his ‘crazy paper’ to Born, who encouraged him to publish, writing to Einstein that it was ‘rather mystifying’ but also ‘true and profound’. Only after the paper was in print did Born remember that he had been taught about similar arrays years earlier.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anxious to make his name with a big discovery, Schrödinger worked through a two-week tryst with an ex-lover in an Alpine resort that Christmas, returning to Zurich in January to apply his new wave equation to some of the key problems that were being thrown up by atomic physics. ‘A late erotic outburst’ was how Hermann Weyl, a close friend of Schrödinger (and his wife’s lover), would describe the deluge of academic papers that were to follow. Among them was a complete description of the hydrogen atom spectrum based on his theory and a version of his equation that showed how the waves evolved over time.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Heisenberg was even blunter about the failings of Schrödinger’s wave mechanics. ‘It’s crap,’ he wrote to Pauli. He was particularly disturbed by the physical picture that Schrödinger was trying to paint of the atom’s inner workings.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paul Dirac, whom novelist Ian McEwan describes as ‘a man entirely claimed by science, bereft of small talk and other human skills’. His Cambridge colleagues even named a unit of speech after him: a ‘dirac’ amounted to a single, solitary word per hour.</em></p>

<p><em>Paul Dirac, whom novelist Ian McEwan describes as ‘a man entirely claimed by science, bereft of small talk and other human skills’. His Cambridge colleagues even named a unit of speech after him: a ‘dirac’ amounted to a single, solitary word per hour. Dirac would later fall in love with and marry Margit Wigner, the sister of Johnny’s school friend Eugene. He would even learn to tell a joke or two. But in the 1920s, the young Dirac was a man who cared little for anything other than advanced physics and who, in the words of Freeman Dyson, ‘seemed to be able to conjure laws of nature from pure thought’.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>German, not English, was the language of science in the 1920s. Practically all the founding papers of quantum mechanics were written in it. There was a flood of congresses and conferences for young researchers to attend.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Von Neumann’s usual approach to giving seminars was not to spoil them by over-preparing. He would often think through what he might say on the train journey to the conference, turn up at the seminar with no notes and then race through the maths. If he filled up the blackboard, he would rub out a swathe of earlier equations and plough on. Those not as quick on the uptake as he was – i.e. nearly everyone – referred to his inimitable seminar style as ‘proof by erasure’.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Abraham Pais recalled ‘that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it’.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The scheme to entice the two Hungarians had been cooked up by Oswald Veblen, a distinguished Princeton professor of mathematics. America was an intellectual backwater and Veblen wanted to change that by poaching some of Europe’s most brilliant mathematicians with the offer of huge American salaries. He had secured millions of dollars from the Rockefeller foundation and wealthy private donors to erect a grand new building, named Fine Hall, for the mathematics department. Now he just needed the mathematicians to fill it.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘Jancsi felt at home in America from the first day,’ Wigner continued. ‘He was a cheerful man, an optimist who loved money and believed firmly in human progress. Such men were far more common in the United States than in the Jewish circles of central Europe.’</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>‘I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission,’ he retorted. ‘We are a university, not a bath house.’</em></p>
</li>

<p><em>intellectually dynamic but psychologically frail Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel would demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that mathematics is either complete or consistent. Five years after Gödel’s breakthrough, a twenty-three-year-old Turing would attack Hilbert’s ‘decision problem’ (Entscheidungsproblem) in a way completely unanticipated by any other logician, conjuring up an imaginary machine to show that mathematics is not decidable</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One can,’ he ventured modestly, ‘even give examples of propositions (and in fact of those of the type of Goldbach or Fermat) that, while contentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics.’ In other words, there are truths in mathematics that cannot be proven by mathematics. Mathematics is not complete.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gödel had announced one of the foremost intellectual feats of the twentieth century. He must have been rather piqued when the response to this revelation was even more muted than the perfunctory praise that had greeted his thesis. The assemblage politely ignored his carefully prepared one-sentence bombshell as if he had cracked a bad joke at a dinner party.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet it appears that only one person grasped the import of Gödel’s achievement well enough to want to know more. After the round table was over, von Neumann, there as a trusted evangelist for Hilbert’s programme, grabbed Gödel by the sleeve and steered him to a quiet corner to grill him about his methods.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The following day Hilbert gave his retirement address, a passionate speech in which he declared again there were no unsolvable problems in mathematics and uttered the words that would become the epitaph on his gravestone: We must know – we will know. But Gödel had already proved him wrong.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>At the heart of Gödel’s proof was a restatement of the liar’s paradox. In its usual form, the paradox can be phrased: ‘This sentence is false.’ Awkwardly, this is only true if it is false – a fact that has tied grammarians and logicians in knots for centuries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>While others were still grappling with Gödel’s work, von Neumann immediately understood what Hilbert, and even Gödel himself, would struggle to accept. ‘My personal opinion,’ he said, ‘which is shared by many others, is that Gödel has shown that Hilbert’s program is essentially hopeless.’ Von Neumann called Gödel the greatest logician since Aristotle and gave up working on the foundations of mathematics.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When, after Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany in 1938, Gödel was denied a post at the University of Vienna partly for having ‘always travelled in liberal-Jewish circles’, von Neumann would campaign to bring him to the IAS. ‘Gödel is absolutely irreplaceable; he is the only mathematician alive about whom I would dare to make this statement,’ he wrote to Flexner. ‘Salvaging him from the wreck of Europe is one of the great single contributions anyone could make to science at this moment.’</em></p>

In Princeton, Gödel became convinced that the radiators and refrigerator in his home were emitting poisonous gas and had them removed, shivering through his first few winters.

Once he had finished, he would replace the book and leave – all without saying a word to von Neumann’s young wife.</em></p>
