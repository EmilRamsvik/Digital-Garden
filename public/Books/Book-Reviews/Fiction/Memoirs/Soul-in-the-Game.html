<p>It was one of the better ones. Writing this review, listening to Chopin again filled with understanding of his life and his motivations, and discovering new composers such as Berlioz makes it worth it.

<p><em>When I was a teenager, a few years before we left for the US, Russian bureaucrats figured out that if you grind fish, you can feed it to chickens. Suddenly we had an abundance of chickens. Unfortunately, the chickens that were fed fish tasted like fish. When I moved to the US, I could not eat chicken for ten years.</em></p>

<p><em>Russia had a draft army. It was not concerned about recruitment and thus treated its soldiers very poorly (an understatement). The pay was only high enough for soldiers to afford the postage to write home asking for money. Russian youth looked at serving in the Russian army as akin to a two-year prison sentence (at least when I was there; I have been told that has changed).</em></p>

<p><em>Let’s start with soul – that’s the immaterial part of us, our essence, the dearest part of ourselves. The game is whatever creative endeavor we are deeply involved in, be it running a company, creating art, writing, investing, or making sushi – any creative pursuit that you believe is worthy of your effort and time. When you have soul in the game, this pursuit has all of you, every ounce of your attention and strength and love.</em></p>

<p><em>After ten years of apprenticeship, Jiro finally allows his apprentice to make an egg custard (tamagoyaki). That becomes the apprentice’s sole focus for months. He goes through 200 batches before Jiro is satisfied with his egg custard and calls him shokunin – an artisan.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Artisans have sacred taboos. They won’t break them for financial benefit.</em></p>

<p><em>I called my father and shared with him my “happy” news and my concerns about it. He was calm; I could sense him smiling on the other end of the line. He said, “There are six billion people in the world. There are billions of parents out there. They’ve figured it out; so will you.”</em></p>

<p><em>Stick with my diet religiously when I am in Denver, but when I travel I have no diet; I can eat anything my stomach (or brain) desires. I instituted this strategy because I found that it was often difficult, inconvenient, and frustrating to stick to my diet when I am not in Denver.</em></p>

<p><em>Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day (even on weekends).

I said, “Well, how much energy does it take you not to eat pork?” He said, “None. I don’t eat pork.” Do the same with bread, I said. He did. He called me a few months later, thanking me for the weight he had lost.</em></p>

<p><em>Was living in Russia; the Cold War had just ended. Capitalist American books suddenly became very popular. Carnegie’s was one of the first to be translated into Russian and was “the book to read.” Everyone wanted to be a capitalist, and this book was supposed to make me a better one. I decided, however, that it was stuffed with disingenuous fluff – that it taught the reader how to not be authentic; it turned you into a fake.</em></p>

<p><em>As the son and I were talking about his upcoming fatherhood, I asked him what kind of father he wants to be. He said, “I don’t want to be like my father.” I was a bit surprised and asked why.   He said:   After my father passed away, his friends would tell me how he was this larger-than-life, gregarious man. I never saw that man. My father worked 16-hour days, seven days a week. He worked in the basement – he’d come up for dinner and go back down. He never spent time with me or my sister. My mom did everything, from driving us to school to taking me to football practice. I always felt like I was raised by my mother. I don’t want to be like that. I want to be there for my kids.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My father thought till the last moment that he’d beat the cancer, and so he never expressed his true feelings to me or my sister. A year later my father’s friend told me that my father confided in him that he wished he’d spent more time with us kids.</em></p>

<p><em>Buffett has a friend who survived the Holocaust. When she looks at people, she only asks one question: Would they hide me? Buffett said, “When you are 70 and you look back at your life, and you have a lot of people who would hide you, then you’ll have had a very successful life.”</em></p>

<p><em>There are four modes of communicating: preacher, prosecutor, politician, and scientist.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If you are in preacher mode, you are fully convinced of your belief and are trying to get others to embrace your gospel. A politician is trying to win the approval of others with a message he may or may not believe in. A prosecutor is trying to build an argument to convince you to change your mind.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Steve Jobs, in addition to being a visionary, had the talent of being able to convince others to do what seemed impossible. Apple employees called it “Steve’s reality distortion field.” Jobs was in preacher mode.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>However, scientist mode has its own appeal. A scientist treats ideas as hypotheses that need to be tested. Ideas are just malleable starting points (as opposed to hardened truths) for further investigation.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What stands between other modes and the scientist mode is our ego. I keep coming back to Epictetus when he says, “It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“I’m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition. I think that I am qualified to speak only when I’ve reached that state.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Admit where your arguments are weak. This goes to the core of intellectual honesty. This will only make the search for the truth more expeditious.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Here is another example. Intellectual debate is deeply embedded in the Jewish legal system. By Jewish law, a court will not accept a capital punishment verdict if it was delivered by a unanimous decision of 23 judges who decide upon capital cases. Yes, you read that right. There has to be at least one dissenting opinion for the death penalty verdict to be accepted. The court wants to make sure there was at least one voice in the proceedings that forced judges to confront the opposing argument. In other words, the court wants to make sure the decision was not merely tribal, but was debated.</em></p>

<p><em>The premiere of Rachmaninoff’s first symphony in Saint Petersburg in 1897 was an utter disaster. How bad? One music critic compared it to the ten plagues of Egypt. It was under-rehearsed by the orchestra, and there is even a theory that the conductor was drunk. Rachmaninoff wrote, “If the public were familiar with the symphony, they would blame the conductor (I continue to ‘assume’), but when a composition is both unknown and badly performed, the public is inclined to blame the composer.”</em></p>

<p><em>Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) was a master of emotions. He was a neurotic, highly sensitive person, full of phobias. For instance, he had a phobia that his head would fall off when he was conducting. (He eventually overcame this phobia, since at times he had to earn a living as a conductor.) His music is ridden with emotions; it is the manifestation of his emotions. It is his emotional confession.</em></p>

<p><em>Craft is a skill that accumulates with time and is formed by experience, practice, learning, and usually a lot of repetition. It is a fundamental layer of any creative endeavour.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And then there is art. Art needs tension. This tension is caused by the uncertainty, the fogginess, that lies between the present and a final outcome. It is filled with conflicting emotions.</em></p>

<p><em>Heard a story about the French Impressionist painter Edgar Degas. He was a perfectionist and had an incredibly hard time completing his paintings. Often, when he would encounter one of his paintings hanging in someone else’s house, he’d stare at it intensely for a while and then ask the owner of the painting whether he or she would mind lending it to him so he could finish it. Who could say no to this? As the story goes, sometimes the owner would never get the painting back, as Degas would ruin it in the process of trying to make it perfect.</em></p>
