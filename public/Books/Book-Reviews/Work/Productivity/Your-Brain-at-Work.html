<p>This book is about how you can understand and work on your performance by understanding how the brain works. The book goes through different scenarios and explains why the persons in the scenario do what they do and what they can do to achieve better results.  The book contains helpful hints about how to “hack” your brain to achieve better results and improve your life.</p>

<p><em>More people than ever are being paid to think, instead of just doing routine tasks. Yet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>While the brain is exquisitely powerful, even the brain of a Harvard graduate can be turned into that of an eight-year-old simply by being made to do two things at once.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>These five functions, understanding, deciding, recalling, memorizing, and inhibiting, make up the majority of conscious thought and are recombined to plan, problem-solve, communicate, and other tasks. Each function uses the prefrontal cortex intensively and requires significant resources to operate,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conscious mental activities chew up metabolic resources, the fuel in your blood, significantly faster than automatic brain functions such as how your brain helps keep your heart beating or your lungs breathing. The stage requires a lot of energy to function.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The first clinical evidence for this limitation came way back in 1898. The scientist J. C. Welsh measured people’s ability to do physical tasks while thinking. She had subjects start a mental task and then asked them to impose as much force as they could, at the same time, on a dynamometer, a machine for measuring force. Her measurements showed that almost all mental tasks reduced maximum force, often by as much as 50 percent.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If Emily knew how energy-hungry her stage was, she would start her Monday morning differently. The big difference is she would prioritize prioritizing. She would prioritize first, before any other attention-rich activity such as emailing. That’s because prioritizing is one of the brain’s most energy-hungry processes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This partly explains why people spend more time thinking about problems (things they have seen) than solutions (things they have never seen). It explains why setting goals feels so hard (it’s hard to envision the future). Daniel Gilbert’s 2006 book, Stumbling on Happiness, dives deeply into the implications of this finding, illustrating how human beings are terrible at estimating emotions in the future, a concept he calls affective forecasting.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gilbert shows how people define how they will feel in the future based more on the way they feel today, instead of correctly assessing the mental state they might be in at a future date. That’s because it’s difficult.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Like the coding used on the ski slopes for the degree of difficulty, there are mental tasks that are green, blue, and black. Prioritizing, at least in a knowledge economy full of conceptual projects, is definitely a black run, perhaps even a double black diamond. Do it when you are fresh and energized, or you might crash and burn down the hill.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This tendency means scheduling the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind. This could be early in the morning, or perhaps after a break or exercise. The prefrontal cortex has much in common with other energy-hungry body parts such as muscles. It tires from use, and can do a lot more after a good rest. Making a tough decision might take thirty seconds when you are fresh and be impossible when you’re not.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One final insight about prioritizing involves getting disciplined about what you don’t put on the stage. This means not thinking when you don’t have to, becoming disciplined about not paying attention to non-urgent tasks unless, or until, it’s truly essential that you do. Learning to say no to mental tasks that are not among your priorities is difficult but very helpful. Another technique for thinking less about unnecessary tasks is to delegate well.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Another technique is not to think at all about a project until all the information is at hand. Don’t waste energy solving a problem you know you will have more information about later.</em></p>

<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.</em></li>
<li><em>Every time the brain works on an idea consciously, it uses up a measurable and limited resource.</em></li>
<li><em>Some mental processes take up a lot more energy than others.</em></li>

<li><em>Some Things to Try</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Think of conscious thinking as a precious resource to conserve. Prioritize prioritizing, as it’s an energy-intensive activity.</em></li>
<li><em>Save mental energy for prioritizing by avoiding other high-energy consuming conscious activities such as dealing with emails.</em></li>
<li><em>Schedule the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind.</em></li>
<li><em>Use the brain to interact with information rather than trying to store information, by creating visuals for complex ideas and by listing projects.</em></li>
<li><em>Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.</em></li>

<p><em>Paul has hit a second limit of the prefrontal cortex here: there’s a limit to how much information can be held in mind and manipulated at any one time. That’s because the stage is small, smaller than generally acknowledged. To make a series of important decisions this morning, Paul has to quickly make sense of a huge amount of information.</em></p>

<li><em>The stage is small, much smaller than commonly realized.</em></li>
<li><em>The less you hold in mind at once the better.</em></li>
<li><em>New concepts take up more space on the stage than ideas you know well.</em></li>
<li><em>Memory starts to degrade when you try to hold more than one idea in mind.</em></li>
<li><em>When trying to make a decision between items, the optimal number of items to compare is two. The optimal number of different ideas to hold in mind at one time is no more than three or four, ideally three.</em></li>

<p><em>This idea that conscious processes need to be done one at a time has been studied in hundreds of experiments since the 1980s. For example, the scientist Harold Pashler showed that when people do two cognitive tasks at once, their cognitive capacity can drop from that of a Harvard MBA to that of an eight-year-old. It’s a phenomenon called dual-task interference.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The lesson is clear: if accuracy is important, don’t divide your attention.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The problem isn’t doing two things at once so much as doing two conscious mental tasks at once, unless you are okay with a significant drop in performance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“To pay continuous partial attention is to keep a top-level item in focus, and constantly scan the periphery in case something more important emerges.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What people tend to do is what Emily tried to do in the meeting. They try to hold several focuses at once and switch rapidly between them. You might think this is a fine idea. But consider what happens when you hold tasks in the background. Given your small working memory, you decrease the amount of data that can be held for what you want to focus on at any moment. Instead of four items on the stage at once, you may be down to three, or even just two. Space is being taken up in working memory for the items held just off the stage.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Once you repeat a pattern often enough, the basal ganglia can drive the process, freeing up the stage for new functions. Develop routines that can be repeated over and over again: How you call people. How you open up a new document, how you delete emails, how you schedule your time.</em></p>

<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You can focus on only one conscious task at a time.</li>
<li>Switching between tasks uses energy; if you do this a lot you can make more mistakes.</li>
<li>If you do multiple conscious tasks at once you will experience a big drop-off in accuracy or performance.</li>
<li>The only way to do two mental tasks quickly, if accuracy is important, is doing one of them at a time. Multitasking can be done easily if you are executing embedded routines.</li>

<p><em>One study found that office distractions eat up an average 2. hours a day. Another study found that employees spend an average of 11 minutes on a project before being distracted. After an interruption, it takes them 25 minutes to return to the original task, if they do at all. People switch activities every 3 minutes, either making a call, speaking with someone in their cubicle, or working on a document.</em></p>

<p><em>According to Microsoft, if you’re looking for a technological solution to being more efficient, getting a bigger computer screen is one of the few clear winners.</em></p>

<p><em>Less energy equals less capacity to understand, decide, recall, memorize, and inhibit. The result could be mistakes on important tasks. Or distractions can cause you to forget good ideas and lose valuable insights. Having a great idea and not being able to remember it can be frustrating, like an itch you can’t scratch, yet another distraction to manage.</em></p>

<p><em>Once you understand how much energy is involved in high-level thinking such as planning and creating, you might be more vigilant about allowing distractions to steal your attention.</em></p>

<p><em>One reason for your wandering attention is that the nervous system is constantly processing, reconfiguring, and reconnecting the trillions of connections in your brain each moment. The term for this is ambient neural activity. If you were to look at the electrical activity even in a resting brain, it would look like planet Earth from space with electrical storms lighting up different regions several times a second. The result is a stream of thoughts and images emerging into conscious awareness.</em></p>

<p><em>It seems that you may not have much free will, but you do have “free won’t” (a term coined by Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz), which is the ability to avoid urges. However, you have only a small window in which to inhibit a response. And, of course, if your stage is too full, you may not have the space to hold the concept of inhibition there. It’s starting to become clear why, when you’re tired, hungry, or anxious, it’s easier to make mistakes and harder to inhibit the wrong impulses.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Attention is easily distracted.</li>
<li>When we get distracted it’s often a result of thinking about ourselves, which activates the default network in the brain.</li>
<li>A constant storm of electrical activity takes place in the brain.</li>
<li>Distractions exhaust the prefrontal cortex’s limited resources. Being “always on” (connected to others via technology) can drop your IQ significantly, as much as losing a night’s sleep.</li>
<li>Focus occurs partly through the inhibition of distractions.</li>
<li>The brain has a common braking system for all types of braking.</li>
<li>Inhibition uses a lot of energy because the braking system is part of the prefrontal cortex.</li>
<li>Each time you inhibit something, your ability to inhibit again is reduced.</li>
<li>Inhibition requires catching an impulse when it first emerges, before the momentum of an action takes over.</li>
<li>Having explicit language for mental patterns gives you a greater ability to stop patterns emerging early on, before they take over.</li>

<p><em>In 1908, scientists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson discovered a fact about human performance that they called the inverted U. They found that performance was poor at low levels of stress, hit a sweet spot at reasonable levels of stress, and tapered off under high stress. The verb stress means “to emphasize,” and it’s not necessarily a negative thing. It’s wrong to think your performance would improve if stress disappeared from your life. It takes a certain amount of stress just to get out of bed in the morning. This type of stress is known as eustress, or positive stress. Positive stress helps focus your attention.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Putting aside stimulants such as caffeine (which is, like a bigger computer screen, a proven technique for increasing mental performance), there are two main strategies for increasing arousal.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One strategy, perhaps the easiest and quickest, is to increase adrenaline levels by bringing “urgency” to a task. Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is the brain equivalent of the adrenaline most people feel before public speaking. It’s the chemistry of fear. When you are scared, you pay intense attention; you are highly alert. Fear brings a deep and immediate alertness. Norepinephrine also turns out to be important for binding circuits together in the prefrontal cortex. You can play various “tricks” on yourself to generate the release of this chemical. Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it. One study found that picturing yourself doing a finger exercise increased muscle mass by 22 percent, which was close to the 30 percent achieved by doing the exercise for real.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scientists have also found that expecting a positive event, anything the brain perceives as a reward, generates dopamine. Rewards to the brain include food, sex, money, and positive social interactions. So Paul could have put his prefrontal cortex into the right neurochemical sweet spot by focusing on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One study showed that new lovers’ brains have a lot in common with people on cocaine. Dopamine is sometimes called the “drug of desire.” Too much dopamine, from being “high with excitement,” can also be exhausting.</em></p>

<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving feedback often creates an intense threat response that doesn’t help people improve performance.</li>
<li>The problem-solving approach may not be the most effective pathway to solutions.</li>
<li>Providing suggestions often results in a lot of wasted time. Bringing people to their own insights is a fast way of getting people back on track.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Catch yourself when you go to give feedback, problem solve, or provide solutions.</li>
<li>Help people think about their own thinking by focusing them on their own subtle internal thoughts, without getting into too much detail.</li>
<li>Find ways to make it valuable for people to give themselves feedback; reward them for activating their director.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hebb’s Law, which says that “Cells that fire together, wire together.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As Sir Winston Churchill once said, “I love to learn, but I hate to be taught.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“There are toward goals and away goals,” Barrell explains, “and which one you use has quite an impact on performance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Toward goals have you visualize and create connections around where you are going. You are creating new connections. What’s interesting is you start to feel good at lower levels with toward goals. There are benefits earlier. Away goals have you visualize what can go wrong, which reactivates the emotions involved.” The trouble is, because problems come to mind so much easier than solutions, people are always setting away goals instead of toward goals. Also, problems are more certain than unknown solutions, and the brain naturally steers toward certainty. For these reasons and more, toward goals are rare, and setting them might require getting some help from someone else, such as a mentor or coach.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When you set an away goal, you can end up paying attention to the negative emotions instead of making new connections. Lose weight, stop smoking, don’t drink: most of the New Year’s resolutions of the world are away goals.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The term “attention density,” coined by Jeffrey M. Schwartz, provides a scientific framework for future research about repeated attention. This density can be measured with such variables as frequency, duration, and intensity of attention. This looks like measuring how often you recall an idea, how long each time, and with how much focus.</em></p>

<p><em>Surprises About the Brain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>While human change appears hard, change in the brain is constant.</li>
<li>Focused attention changes the brain.</li>
<li>Attention goes all too easily to the threat. Once you focus attention away from threat, you can create new connections with the right questions.</li>
<li>Creating long-term change requires paying regular attention to deepen new circuits, especially when they are new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Some Things to Try</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Practice watching for people’s emotional state when you want to facilitate change.</li>
<li>Don’t try to influence people when they are in a strong away state.</li>
<li>Use elements of the SCARF model to shift people into a toward state.</li>
<li>Practice using solution-focused questions that focus people’s attention directly on the specific circuits you want to bring to life.</li>
<li>Invent ways to have people pay repeated attention to new circuits.</li>
