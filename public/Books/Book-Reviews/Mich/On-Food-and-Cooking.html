<p><em>Whenever we cook we become practical chemists, drawing on the accumulated knowledge of generations, and transforming what the Earth offers us into more concentrated forms of pleasure and nourishment.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Began the gradual decline of the horses and the expansion of the deer family, the ruminants, which evolved the ability to survive on dry grass. Cattle, sheep, goats, and their relatives are all ruminants.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The key to the rise of the ruminants is their highly specialized, multichamber stomach, which accounts for a fifth of their body weight and houses trillions of fiber-digesting microbes, most of them in the first chamber, or rumen.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The immediate ancestor of Bos taurus, the common dairy cow, was Bos primigenius, the long-horned wild aurochs.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Most traditional cattle breeds have been abandoned in favor of high-yielding black-and-white Friesian (Holstein) cows, which now account for 90% of all American dairy cattle and 85% of British.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The cows are farmed in ever larger herds and fed an optimized diet that seldom includes fresh pasturage, so most modern milk lacks the color, flavor, and seasonal variation of preindustrial milk.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In their roots, both milk and dairy recall the physical effort it once took to obtain milk and transform it by hand. Milk comes from an Indo-European root that meant both “milk” and “to rub off,” the connection perhaps being the stroking necessary to squeeze milk from the teat.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In medieval times, dairy was originally dey-ery, meaning the room in which the dey, or woman servant, made milk into butter and cheese.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Thanks to the rumen microbes, which convert the unsaturated fatty acids of grass and grain into saturated fatty acids, the milk fat of ruminant animals is the most highly saturated of our common foods. Only coconut oil beats it.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The first fluid secreted by the mammary gland is colostrum, a creamy, yellow solution of concentrated fat, vitamins, and proteins, especially immunoglobulins and antibodies.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>According to business legend, the American Gail Borden reinvented evaporated milk around 1853 after a rough transatlantic crossing that sickened the ship’s cows. Borden added large amounts of sugar to keep his concentrated milk from spoiling.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>For sweetened condensed milk, the milk is first concentrated by evaporation, and then table sugar is added to give a total sugar concentration of about 55%. Microbes can’t grow at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" class="external">osmotic<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> pressure, so sterilization is unnecessary.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Powdered or dry milk is the result of taking evaporation to the extreme. Milk is pasteurized at a high temperature; then about 90% of its water is removed by vacuum evaporation, and the remaining 10% in a spray drier</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cooking Sweetened Condensed Milk Because it contains concentrated protein and sugar, sweetened condensed milk will “caramelize” (actually, undergo the Maillard browning reaction.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Milk foams are more fragile than egg foams and whipped cream, and are generally made immediately before serving, usually as a topping for coffee drinks.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Milk owes its foaming power to its proteins, which collect in a thin layer around the pockets of air, isolate them, and prevent the water’s strong cohesive forces from popping the bubbles. Egg foams are also stabilized by proteins, while the foam formed by whipping cream is stabilized by fat.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Milk foams are more fragile and short-lived than egg foams because milk’s proteins are sparse — just 3% of the milk’s weight, where egg white is 10% protein</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because the whey proteins are the critical stabilizers, milks that are fortified with added protein — usually reduced-fat and skim milks — are most easily foamed.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>For sheer inventiveness with milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Milk contains roughly equal weights of protein and fat, while in cream fat outweighs protein by at least 10 to 1.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>fraîche: “fresh, cool, new.” In France, crème fraîche may be either “sweet” or cultured with lactic acid bacteria; in the United States, the term always means cultured, tart, thick cream.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Butter making is in essence a simple but laborious operation: you agitate a container of cream until the fat globules are damaged and their fat leaks out and comes together into masses large enough to gather.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Original buttermilk, rich in free globule membrane material and with about 0.5% fat.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In France, for example, butter from Normandy is relatively soft and favored for spreading and making sauces — Elizabeth David said, “When you get melted butter with a trout in Normandy it is difficult to believe that it is not cream” — while butter from the Charentes is firmer, and preferred for making pastries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because its scant water is dispersed in tiny droplets, properly made butter resists gross contamination by microbes, and keeps well for some days at room temperature. However, its delicate flavor is easily coarsened by simple exposure to the air and to bright light, which break fat molecules into smaller fragments that smell stale and rancid.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ghee (from the Sanskrit for “bright”) was born of necessity. Ordinary butter spoils in only ten days in much of the country, while the clarified fat keeps six to eight months.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The effect of salts on freezing was known in the 13th century Arab world.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A distinct style of custard ice cream is the Italian gelato, which is typically high in butterfat as well as egg yolks, and frozen with little overrun into a very rich, dense cream.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Generally, premium-quality ice creams are made with more cream and egg yolks than less expensive types.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yogurt and its relatives are native to a broad and climatically warm area of central and southwest Asia and the Middle East, an area that includes the probable home of dairying,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yogurt is the Turkish word for milk that has been fermented into a tart, semisolid mass; it comes from a root meaning “thick.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Early in the 20th century, the Russian Nobelist Ilya Metchnikov (who discovered that white blood cells fight bacterial infection) gave a scientific rationale to this belief, when he proposed that the lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks eliminate toxic microbes in our digestive system that otherwise shorten our lives.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A distinctive subfamily among the cream cultures are the “ropy” milks of Scandinavia, so-called because they’re more than stringy: lift a spoonful of Finnish viili, Swedish långfil, or Norwegian tättemjölk, and the rest of the bowl follows it into the air.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cheese is one of the great achievements of humankind.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Another remarkable fermented milk little known in the West is kefir, which is most popular in the Caucasus and may well have originated there. Unlike other fermented milks, in which the fermenting microbes are evenly dispersed, kefir is made by large, complex particles known as kefir grains, which house a dozen or more kinds of microbes, including lactobacilli, lactococci, yeasts, and vinegar bacteria.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The earliest good evidence of cheesemaking known to date, a residue found in an Egyptian pot, dates from around 2300 BCE.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Ingredient Essential to Diverse Cheeses: Time</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The crowning blow to cheese diversity and quality was World War II. In continental Europe, agricultural lands became battlefields, and dairying was devastated. During the prolonged recovery, quality standards were suspended, factory production was favored for its economies of scale and ease of regulation, and consumers were grateful for any approximation of the prewar</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Surrealist poet Leon-Paul Fargue is said to have honored Camembert cheese with the title les pieds de Dieu — the feet of God.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The standard garden variety molds come from the large and various genus Penicillium, which also gave us the antibiotic penicillin.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Blue Molds Penicillium roqueforti, as its name suggests, is what gives sheep’s milk Roquefort cheese its veins of blue.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Rubbery, or crumbly curd into a delicious cheese. The French term for ripening, affinage, comes from the Latin finus, meaning “end” or “ultimate point,”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>However, France and Greece lead the world in per capita cheese consumption, at better than 2 oz/60 gm per day, about double the U.S. figures, yet they’re remarkable among Western countries for their relatively low rates of heart disease, probably thanks to their high consumption of heart-protective vegetables, fruits, and wine</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because any soft cheese contains enough moisture to permit the survival of various human pathogens, both pasteurized and unpasteurized versions are probably best avoided by people who may be especially vulnerable to infection</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The egg is one of the kitchen’s marvels, and one of nature’s. Its simple, placid shape houses an everyday miracle: the transformation of a bland bag of nutrients into a living, breathing, vigorous creature</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Victorian Samuel Butler awarded the egg overall priority when he said that a chicken is just an egg’s way of making another egg.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Thanks to a dominant trait unknown in any other wild or domestic chickens, the rare Chilean Araucana lays blue eggs.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The yolk accounts for just over a third of a shelled egg’s weight, and its biological purpose is almost exclusively nutritive.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Designed as it was to protect itself for the duration of the chick’s development, the egg is unique among our raw animal foods in its ability to remain edible for weeks, as long as it’s kept intact and cool.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cook all egg dishes sufficiently to kill any bacteria that might be present. This generally means holding a temperature of at least 140ºF/60ºC for 5 minutes,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Acids and Salt Tenderize There’s no truth to the common saying that acidity and salt “toughen” egg proteins. Acids and salt do pretty much the same thing to egg proteins. They get the proteins together sooner, but they don’t let them get as close together.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easy to tell whether an intact egg is raw or already cooked. Give it a spin on its side. If it spins fast and smoothly, it’s cooked. If it seems balky and wobbly, it’s raw — the liquid insides slip and slosh and resist the movement of the solid shell.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Custard to mean a dish prepared and served in the same container, often baked and therefore unstirred, so that it sets into a solid gel.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Crème brûlée (“burned cream”) is also a custard topped with caramel, but here the caramel should be hard enough to shatter when rapped with a spoon.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Rising is essential for soufflés and sponge cakes, but it is antithetical to the dense richness of cheesecake. Four basic strategies will minimize it. First, beat the ingredients slowly, gently, and only long enough to obtain an even mix. Vigorous or long beating incorporates more air bubbles that will fill with steam and expand during baking. Second, bake the cheesecake slowly in a low oven. This will allow trapped air and steam to disperse gradually and evenly. Third, don’t overbake. This will dry the filling and cause it to shrink from moisture loss. Finally, cool the cheesecake gradually in the open oven.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Physical agitation normally breaks down and destroys structure. But beat eggs and you create structure.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Salt increases the whipping time and decreases the foam’s stability.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sugar both hinders and helps foam making. Added early in the process, it delays foaming, and it reduces the foam’s ultimate volume and lightness. The delay comes from sugar’s interference with the unfolding and bonding of the proteins. And the reduction in volume and lightness is caused by the syrupy sugar-egg mixture being harder to spread into thin bubble walls. Slow foaming is a real disadvantage when the whites are whipped by hand — at standard soft-meringue levels, it doubles the work — but less so if you’re using a stand mixer. The helpful thing about sugar is that it improves the foam’s stability.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The linguist Otto Jänicke has traced the word meringue back to an alteration of the Latin word merenda, meaning “light evening meal,” into meringa, a form that was found in the Artois and Picardie near what is now Belgium.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Charles’s law also means that what must go up in the oven must come down at the table. A balloon expands as its temperature rises, but shrinks again if its temperature falls.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Charles’s law is this: all else equal, the volume occupied by a given weight of gas is proportional to its temperature.</em></p>

<p><em>Our primate ancestors lived almost exclusively on plant foods until 2 million years ago, when the changing African climate and diminishing vegetation led them to scavenge animal carcasses.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Humans became active hunters around 100,000 years ago, and it’s vividly clear from cave paintings of wild cattle and horses that they saw their prey as embodiments of strength and vitality.</em></p>

<p><em>Salt pork was as much a staple food as bread (hence such phrases as “scraping the bottom of the barrel” and “pork-barrel politics”).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Today, with one-fifteenth of the world’s population, the United States eats one-third of the world’s meat. Meat consumption on this scale is possible only in wealthy societies like our own, because animal flesh remains a much less efficient source of nourishment than plant protein.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Saxons had their own Germanic names for the animals — ox, steer, cow, heifer, and calf; sheep, ram, wether, ewe, and lamb; swine, hog, gilt, sow, and pig — and named their flesh by attaching “meat of” to the animal name. When French became the language of the English nobility in the centuries following the Conquest, the animal names survived in the countryside, but the prepared meats were rechristened in the fashion of the court cooks: the first recipe books in English call for beef (from the French boeuf), veal (veau), mutton (mouton), and pork (porc).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Exactly because it is a nutritious material, meat is especially vulnerable to colonization by microbes, mainly bacteria. And because animal skins and digestive tracts are rich reservoirs of bacteria, it’s inevitable that initially clean meat surfaces will be contaminated during slaughter and the removal of skin, feathers, and innards.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The two most prominent causes of serious meat-borne illness are Salmonella and E. coli.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Meat production is big business. In the United States just a few decades ago, it was second only to automobile manufacturing.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lean meat is made up of three basic materials: it’s about 75% water, 20% protein, and 3% fat. These materials are woven into three kinds of tissue. The main tissue is the mass of muscle cells, the long fibers that cause movement when they contract and relax. Surrounding the muscle fibers is the connective tissue, a kind of living glue that harnesses the fibers together and to the bones that they move. And interspersed among the fibers and connective tissue are groups of fat cells, which store fat as a source of energy for the muscle fibers.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One, a protein called elastin for its stretchiness, is the main component of blood vessel walls and ligaments, and is especially tough; its cross-links cannot be broken by the heat of cooking.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The major connective-tissue filament is the protein called collagen, which makes up about a third of all the protein in the animal body, and is concentrated in skin, tendons, and bones. The name comes from the Greek for “glue producing,” because when it’s heated in water, solid, tough collagen partly dissolves into sticky gelatin</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why do chickens have both white and dark meat, and why do the two kinds of meat taste different? Why is veal pale and delicate, beef red and robust? The key is the muscle fiber. There are several different kinds of muscle fiber, each designed for a particular kind of work, and each with its own color and flavor.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Red muscle fibers are used for prolonged efforts. They are fueled primarily by fat, whose metabolism absolutely requires oxygen, and obtain both fat (in the form of fatty acids) and oxygen from the blood. Red fibers are relatively thin, so that fatty acids and oxygen can diffuse into them from the blood more easily.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fat cells, on the other hand, are essentially storage tissue, and any sort of fat-soluble material can end up in them.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In general, grass or forage feeding results in stronger-tasting meat than grain or concentrate feeding, thanks to the plants’ high content of various odorous substances, reactive polyunsaturated fatty acids, and chlorophyll, which rumen microbes convert into chemicals called terpenes, relatives of the aroma compounds in many herbs and spices</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lambs and sheep store a number of unusual molecules, including branched-chain fatty acids that their livers produce from a compound generated by the microbes in their rumen, and thymol, the same molecule that gives thyme its aroma.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The “piggy” flavor of pork and gamy flavor of duck are thought to come from intestinal microbes and their fat-soluble products of amino-acid metabolism,</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The deep “beefy” flavor of beef, however, is more prominent in grain-fed animals.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And the flavor carried in fat gets stronger as animals get older, as more of the flavor compounds are put into storage. This is why lamb is generally more popular than mutton from mature sheep.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Life intensifies flavor, and modern meat animals are living less and less.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cattle are our largest meat animals and take the longest to reach adulthood, about two years, so their meat is relatively dark and flavorful.</em></p>

<p><em>Japan prizes its shimofuri, or highly marbled beef, of which the best known comes from the Kobe region. Steers of the native Wagyu draft breed are slaughtered at 24–30 months.

<p><em>Fat Oxidation and Rancidity The most important chemical damage suffered by meats is the breakdown of their fats by both oxygen and light into small, odorous fragments that define the smell of rancidity. Rancid fat won’t necessarily make us sick, but it’s unpleasant, so its development limits how long we can age and store meat.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Unsaturated fats are most susceptible to rancidity, which means that fish, poultry, and game birds go bad most quickly.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Beef has the most saturated and stable of all meat fats, and keeps the longest.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Refrigeration has two great advantages: it requires little or no preparation time, and it leaves the meat relatively unchanged from its fresh state.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Freezing greatly extends the storage life of meat and other foods because it halts all biological processes. Life requires liquid water, and freezing immobilizes the food’s liquid water in solid crystals of ice.</em></p>

<p><em>A last side effect of freezing is freezer burn, that familiar brownish-white discoloration of the meat surface that develops after some weeks or months of storage.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>How cooking forces moisture from meat. Water molecules are bound up in the protein fibrils that fill each muscle cell. As the meat is heated, the proteins coagulate, the fibrils squeeze out some of the water they had contained and shrink.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>The cook’s margin of error in cooking meat is narrower than it used to be. So it’s more useful than ever to understand how the various methods for cooking meat work, and how best to apply them to the meat of the 21st century.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bacteria are on the meat surfaces, not inside.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Many traditional meat recipes were developed at a time when meats came from mature, fatty animals, and so were fairly tolerant of overcooking.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The meats, typically poultry or pork, are immersed in a brine containing 3 to 6% salt by weight for anywhere from a few hours to two days (depending on thickness) before being cooked as usual. They come out noticeably juicier.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Barbecuing is the low-temperature, slow heating of meat in a closed chamber by means of hot air from smoldering wood coals. It’s an outdoor cousin to the slow oven roast, and produces smoky, fall-apart tender meat.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The term barbecue comes via the Spanish barbacoa from the West Indies, and a Taino word that meant a framework of green sticks suspended on corner posts, on which meat, fish, and other foods were laid and cooked in the open over fire and coals.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fats and oils are a useful cooking medium because they can be heated to temperatures well above the boiling point of water, and can therefore dry, crisp, and brown the food surface.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In fact, moisture loss is proportional to meat temperature, so the high heat of searing actually dries out the meat surface more than moderate heat does.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Meats cooked in liquid should be allowed to cool in that liquid, and are best served at temperatures well below the cooking temperature, around 120ºF/50ºC.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hot water is such an effective heat transmitter that it cooks flat tender cuts of meat very quickly.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poach is a medieval word from the French for the “pouch” of gently cooked egg white that forms around the yolk.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Braise and stew are both 18th-century borrowings from the French, the first coming from a word for “coal,” and referring to the practice of putting coals under and atop the cooking pot, the second from étuve, meaning stove or heated room and so a hot enclosure.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A moist, tender braise or stew results from the cook’s cumulative attention to several details of procedure. The most important rule: never let the meat interior get anywhere near the boil.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Keep the meat as intact as possible to minimize cut surfaces through which fluids can escape. If the meat must be cut, cut it into relatively large pieces, at least an inch/2.5 cm on a side. Brown the meat very quickly in a hot pan so that the inside of the meat warms only slightly. This kills microbes on the meat surfaces, and creates flavor. Start the pot with meat and cooking liquid in a cold oven, the pot lid ajar to allow some evaporation, and set the thermostat to 200ºF/93ºC, so that it heats the stew to around 120ºF/50ºC slowly, over two hours. Raise the oven temperature to 250ºF/120ºC so that the stew slowly warms from 120ºF to 180ºF/80ºC. After an hour, check the meat every half hour, and stop the cooking when it is easily penetrated by the tines of a fork. Let the meat cool in the stew, where it will reabsorb some liquid. The liquid will probably need to be reduced by boiling to improve flavor and consistency. Remove the meat first.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There’s some evidence that microwaves are unusually effective at dissolving collagen into gelatin.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Large oven roasts should be allowed to rest on the countertop for at least a half hour before carving, not only to allow the “afterheat” to finish cooking the center (p. 153), but also to allow the meat to cool down, ideally to 120ºF/50ºC or so. (This may take well over an hour; some chefs allow for a rest period equal to the roasting time.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Whenever possible, meat is carved across the grain of the muscle fibers to reduce the impression of fibrousness in the mouth and make the meat easier to chew. Carving knives should be kept sharp. Sawing away with a dull blade compresses the tissue and squeezes its delicious liquid away. Finally, remember that the saturated fats of beef, lamb, and pork are solid at room temperature, which means that they rapidly congeal on the plate.</em></p>

<p><em>Foie gras is the “fat liver” of force-fed geese and ducks. It has been made and appreciated since Roman times and probably long before; the force-feeding of geese is clearly represented in Egyptian art from 2500</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>It’s a kind of living pâté, ingeniously prepared in the growing bird before it’s slaughtered. Constant overnourishment causes the normally small, lean, red organ to grow to 10 times its normal size and reach a fat content of 50 to 65%. The fat is dispersed in insensibly fine droplets within the liver cells, and creates an incomparably integrated, delicate blend of smoothness, richness, and savoriness.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>The word sausage comes from the Latin for “salt,” and names a mixture of chopped meat and salt stuffed into an edible tube.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Salt plays two important roles in the sausage: it controls the growth of microbes, and it dissolves one of the fiber filament proteins (myosin) out of the muscle fibers and onto the meat surfaces, where it acts as a glue to bind the pieces together.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The preservation of meat from biological spoilage has been a major challenge throughout human history. The earliest methods, which go back at least 4,000 years, were physical and chemical treatments that make meat inhospitable to microbes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nowadays, meat is dried by briefly salting it to inhibit surface microbes and then heating it in low-temperature convection ovens to remove at least two-thirds of its weight and 75% of its moisture (more than 10% moisture may allow Penicillium and Aspergillus molds to grow).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because its flavor has been concentrated and its texture is interesting, dried meat remains popular. Modern examples include American jerky, Latin American carne seca, Norwegian fenalår and southern African biltong, whose textures can range from chewy to brittle.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>These days the word confit is used loosely to describe just about anything cooked slowly and gently to a rich, succulent consistency:</em></p>

Norway pioneered the ocean farming of Atlantic salmon in large offshore pens in the 1960s; and today more than a third of the salmon eaten in the world is farmed in Europe and North and South America.</em></p>

<p><em>Fish owe their small, light bones, delicate connective tissue, and large, pale muscle masses to the fact that water is much denser than air. Fish can attain a neutral buoyancy — can be almost weightless — simply by storing some lighter-than-water oils or gas in their bodies.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The paleness of fish flesh results from water’s buoyancy and its resistance to movement</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>But water’s resistance to movement increases exponentially with the fish’s speed. This means that fish must develop very high power very quickly when accelerating. And so they devote most of their muscle mass to an emergency powerpack of fast-twitch white cells that are used only for occasional bursts of rapid movement.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The cold aquatic environment is also responsible for the notorious tendency of fish and shellfish to spoil faster than other meats. The cold has two different effects. First, it requires fish to rely on the highly unsaturated fatty acids that remain fluid at low temperatures: and these molecules are highly susceptible to being broken by oxygen into stale-smelling, cardboardy fragments. More importantly, cold water requires fish to have enzymes that work well in the cold, and the bacteria that live in and on the fish also thrive at low temperatures.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The enzymes and bacteria typical of our warm-blooded meat animals normally work at 100ºF/40ºC, and are slowed to a crawl in a refrigerator at 40ºF/5ºC. But the same refrigerator feels perfectly balmy to deep-water fish enzymes and spoilage bacteria.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are exceptions, but most fish can be thought of as sheets of muscle tissue anchored with connective tissue and the backbone to a propulsive tail. The animals push water behind them, developing thrust by undulations of the whole body and flexing of the tail.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because the motion for steady swimming comes mostly from the back end of the fish, the tail region contains more connective tissue than the head end, and seems more succulent.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Few of us get the chance to enjoy the experience, but very fresh fish smell surprisingly like crushed plant leaves!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The strong smell that we readily identify as “fishy” is largely due to the saltwater-balancing compound TMAO</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Freshwater fish generally don’t accumulate TMAO, and crustaceans accumulate relatively little, so they don’t get as fishy as ocean fish.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>TMA on the surface can be rinsed off with tap water. And acidic ingredients — lemon juice, vinegar, tomatoes — help in two ways. They encourage the stale fragments to react with water and become less volatile; and they contribute a hydrogen ion to TMA and DMA, which thereby take on a positive electrical charge, bond with water and other nearby molecules, and never escape the fish surface to enter our nose.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Salmon quality is thus at its peak as the fish approach the mouth of their home river, which is where commercial fishermen take them.</em></p>
</li>

<p><em>Cooked fish fall into four broad flavor families. Saltwater white fish are the mildest. Freshwater white fish have a stronger aroma thanks to their larger repertoire of fatty-acid fragments and traces of earthiness from ponds and tanks. Freshwater trout have characteristic sweet and mushroomy aromas. Salmon and sea-run trout, thanks to the carotenoid pigments that they accumulate from ocean crustaceans, develop fruity, flowery aromas and a distinctive family note (from an oxygen-containing carbon ring). Tuna, mackerel, and their relatives have a meaty, beefy aroma.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Japanese scientists have found that certain ingredients help reduce the odor, apparently by limiting fatty-acid oxidation or preemptively reacting with TMAO: these include green tea and such aromatics as onion, bay, sage, clove, ginger, and cinnamon, which may also mask the fishy smell with their own.</em></p>

<p><em>All crustaceans share the same basic body plan, which can be divided roughly into two parts. The forward portion, or cephalothorax, often called the “head” in shrimp, is the equivalent of our head and trunk put together. It includes the mouth, sensing antennae and eyes, five pairs of manipulating and crawling appendages, and the main organs of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and reproductive systems. The rear portion, or abdomen, usually called the “tail,” is mostly a large, meaty block of swimming muscle that moves the fin-like plates at the back end. The major exception to this body plan is the crab, which seldom swims; its abdomen is a thin plate folded up underneath a greatly enlarged cephalothorax.</em></p>

<p><em>Most of the shellfish we eat are creatures from one of two groups, the crustaceans and the molluscs.</em></p>

<p><em>Crustaceans are the shellfish that have legs and sometimes claws: shrimps and prawns, lobsters and crayfish, and crabs.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There were primitive shrimps 200 million years ago; today there are some 38,000 crustacean species, the largest with a claw span of 12 feet/4 meters!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The forward part of the crustacean body, the cephalothorax or “head,” contains the digestive and reproductive organs. The rear part, the abdomen or “tail,” is mainly fast muscle tissue that moves the rear fins and propels shrimp</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As a crustacean grows, it must periodically cast off the old cuticle and create a larger new one. This process is called molting.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Molting means that the quality of crustacean flesh is highly variable, and this is why wild harvests are seasonal, with the seasons depending on the particular animal and location</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Shrimp comes from the Indo-European root skerbh, meaning to turn, bend, or shrink, perhaps reflecting the curled shape of these creatures.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The near-synonym prawn first appears in medieval times, and its origins are unknown.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Crab and crayfish both derive from the Indo-European gerbh, meaning to scratch or carve, something that crustacean claws readily do to human skin.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lobster shares with locust the Indo-European root lek, meaning to leap or fly: a remarkably early recognition of the family resemblance of crustaceans and insects.</em></p>
</li>

<p><em>Crustacean itself comes from an Indo-European root meaning to freeze, to form a crust, and describes the hard outer skeleton of these creatures. It shares this root with crystal.</em></p>

<p><em>This highly successful and diverse branch of the animal kingdom got its start half a billion years ago and currently includes 100,000 species, double the number of fish and animal species with backbones, from snails just a millimeter across to giant clams and squids.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The secret to the molluscs’ success — and their strangeness — is their adaptable body plan. It includes three major parts: a muscular “foot” for moving; an intricate assembly that includes the circulatory, digestive, and sexual organs; and enveloping this assembly, a versatile sheet-like “mantle” that takes on such jobs as secreting materials for a shell, supporting eyes and small tentacles that detect food or danger, and contracting and relaxing to control water flow into the interior.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Abalones, the most primitive, have one cup-like shell for protection, and a massive, tough muscular foot for moving along and clinging to the seaweed on which their rasping mouths feed.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>All the bivalves — clams, mussels, oysters — have comb-like gills for filtering food particles from the water that the mantle draws in and expels. Mussels are also two-shelled filter feeders, but they attach their foot permanently to intertidal and subtidal rocks. They have no need for a siphon, and one of their tough shell-closing muscles is much reduced. Oysters cement themselves to inter- and sub-tidal rocks. Their two heavy shells are closed by a single large muscle at their center, around which the mantle and other organs are organized. The bulk of their body is the tender mantle and food-trapping gills. Scallops neither attach nor bury themselves. They lie free on the ocean floor, and escape predators by swimming. Their massive central muscle claps their shells</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The immobile molluscs do very well in aquaculture. They can be raised in large numbers in the water’s three dimensions, suspended in nets or on ropes, and grow rapidly thanks to the good circulation of oxygen and nutrients.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Because shellfish use amino acids to counteract salt concentration, the saltier the water, the more savory the shellfish.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clams and relatives often benefit from several hours’ immersion in a bucket of cold salt water (1/3 cup salt per gallon, or 20 gm/l) to clean themselves of residual sand and grit.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When the cook wants to “shuck” an oyster or clam, or open the shell and remove the raw meat, it’s the hinge ligament and adductor muscles that must be dealt with.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The U.S. term “hard shell” is applied to sturdy clams that close completely (little-neck, quahog), while “soft shell” clams have siphons much longer than the shell, which is thin and always gapes (steamer, longneck).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Abalone entered English via Spanish from the Monterey Indian word for this streamlined snail, aulun.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clam began in the Indo-European gel, a compact mass: cloud, cling, and clamp are its linguistic relatives. Mussel derives from the Indo-European mus, meaning both “mouse” and “muscle,” which moves quickly like a mouse under the skin.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Oyster, from the Indo-European ost, “bone,” names the mollusc with the heavy and bone-colored shell. Scallop, with its unusually symmetrical and patterned valves, comes via the Middle French escalope, from a Germanic word for “shell.”</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>And squid? To date, the linguists are stumped. It appeared out of nowhere in the 17th century.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Mussels are the easiest molluscs to prepare; they tolerate some overcooking and readily come off the shell.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Oysters became scarce as early as the 17th century, and are now largely farmed.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The greater the salinity of the water, the more taste-active amino acids the oyster’s cells must contain to balance the dissolved salt outside, and so the more savory its flavor.</em></p>

<p><em>Fish pastes and sauces are two phases of the same simple preparation. A mass of fish or shellfish is mixed with salt to give an overall salt concentration between 10% and 30%, and sealed in a closed container for from one month (for pastes) to 24 months (for sauces). Fish pastes tend to have relatively strong fish and cheese notes, while the more thoroughly transformed fish sauces are more meaty and savory.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>One notorious example is Swedish Surstrømming. Herring are fermented in barrels for one to two months, then sealed in cans and allowed to continue for as much as another year. The cans swell, which is normally a warning sign for the growth of botulism bacteria, but for surstrømming a sign of promising flavor development. The unusual bacteria responsible for ripening in the can are species of Haloanaerobium, which produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, hydrogen sulfide, and butyric, propionic, and acetic acids: in effect a combination of rotten eggs, rancid Swiss cheese, and vinegar, overlaid onto the basic fish flavor!</em></p>

<p><em>As a general rule, then, a thin sauce will have a more intense and immediate flavor than the same sauce with thickeners added. But the thickened sauce will release its flavor more gradually and persistently.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The word stock as it’s applied in the kitchen reflects the professional cook’s approach to sauce making. It derives from an old Germanic root meaning “tree trunk,” and has more than 60 related meanings revolving around the idea of basic materials, sources, and supplies.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Much more specific and ancient is broth, which goes back to 1000 CE and a Germanic root bru meaning “to prepare by boiling” and the material so prepared, both it and the boiling liquid. Bouillon and brew are related terms.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Intermediate between stock and glace is demi-glace or “half-glace,” which is stock simmered down to 25–40% of its original volume, often with some tomato puree or paste to add flavor and color, and with some flour or starch to supplement its lower gelatin content (10–15%).</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Such a dispersion of one liquid in another is called an emulsion. The word comes from the Latin for “to milk out,” and referred originally to the milky fluids that can be pressed from nuts and other plant tissues.</em></p>

<li>
<p><em>Bouillabaisse is a Provençal fish soup that takes advantage of gelatin’s thickening and emulsifying properties. It’s made by cooking a variety of whole fish and fish parts, some of them bony and gelatin-producing rather than meaty, in an aromatic broth with some olive oil.</em></p>

<p><em>The French sauce beurre blanc probably evolved from the practice of enriching cooking liquids with butter. It’s made by preparing a flavorful reduction of vinegar and/or wine, then whisking pieces of butter into the reduction.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Preparation closely related to beurre blanc is beurre monté, “worked up” or “prepared” butter, which is simply an unflavored beurre blanc made with an initial dose of water rather than vinegar or wine.</em></p>

<p><em>Sherry Sherry is a fortified, oxidized white wine that was developed in the Spanish port city Jerez de la Frontera, whose name was Anglicized to “sherry” around 1600. True sherry gets its distinctive flavor from the solera system of maturing wine, which was developed early in the 19th century.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The solera is a series of casks, each initially containing the fortified new wine of a particular year, but not completely filled, so a significant area of wine surface is in direct contact with the air. The wine therefore develops a characteristic intense, oxidized flavor. As the cask contents evaporate and become more concentrated, each is replenished with wine from the next younger cask.</em></p>

<p><em>The simplest, oldest, and slowest method was perfected in the Middle Ages in the French city of Orléans, where spoiled barrels of Bordeaux and Burgundy wine on their way to Paris were identified and salvaged as vinegar.

<p><em>True balsamic vinegar, aceto balsamico, is a vinegar like no other: almost black in color, syrupy, sweet, remarkably complex in flavor, and remarkably expensive, all thanks to decades-long fermentation, aging, and concentration in wood casks. It has been made in the northern Italian state of Emilia-Romagna since medieval times.</em></p>

<p><em>Even more fortunate and complex are the reactions responsible for the cooked color and flavor of bread crusts, chocolate, coffee beans, dark beers, and roasted meats, all foods that are not primarily sugar. These are known as the Maillard reactions, after Louis Camille Maillard, a French physician, who discovered and described them around 1910.</em></p>
