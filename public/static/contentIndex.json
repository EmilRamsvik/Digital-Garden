An AI strategy should encompass the following subsets of strategies.\n\nData Strategy\nData strategy covers data management, accessibility, and utilization of data.\nMachine Learning Strategy\nMachine learning strategy covers the implementation of infrastructure, the serving of models, inferencing, and monitoring of machine learning models, and implementation of machine learning operations and platforms.\nData Science and Analytics Strategy.\nThe Data Science and Analytics strategy covers the implementation of a guideline for data science and integration with business. Data Science should bridge business use cases and the implementation of analytical and statistical methods.\n\nNote: The use of AI strategy instead of machine learning strategy is because of the more technical nature of the term machine-learning versus the more ambiguous term AI\nLinks\n\n\nDriving Digital Strategy - This is related to the AI strategy discussions- The Weather Company is a case in point. When consumers moved away from TV to mobile phones but did not stay long enough to generate ad revenues, the company execs pivoted and created a service called WeatherFX, which uses data from its app to help retailers predict how the weather will affect consumer purchasing behavior.\n\n\nCreating an independent unit is like launching a speedboat to turn around a large ship. Often the speedboat takes off but does little to move the ship.\n\n\nIn 2012, Kasper Rorsted, CEO of Henkel at the time, realized this when he asked a team of senior leaders to catalog all of Henkel’s digital initiatives. He was shocked to find over 150 separate digital initiatives throughout the company.\n\n\nIn 1960, Theodore Levitt, a Harvard Business School professor, published a provocative paper in Harvard Business Review in which he argued that companies were too focused on products and not enough on customer needs. To help managers address this problem, he asked, “What business are you really in?”\n\n\nIn 1979, Michael Porter, one of my colleagues at Harvard Business School, published a landmark paper in which he argued that a company could follow one of two potential strategies for competitive advantage: either by being cheaper (that is, as a low-cost producer) or by being different (with differentiated products that command higher prices).\n\n\nAlthough Amazon started as a low-cost player without the fixed cost of stores, it is not product-centric knowledge that gives it an advantage of differentiation or low cost. Instead, Amazon has mastered three skills: Deep knowledge of customers obtained from mining customer data. This is embedded in the recommendation system for books and movies as well as in the introduction of new products and services. Back-end logistics for warehousing and shipping that could rival the logistics systems of FedEx and UPS. With its investment in drones and now its own trucking business, Amazon is further strengthening this part of its competency. Knowledge of and ability to manage technology infrastructure. This has allowed it to become not only one of the largest online retailers but also a dominant player in cloud computing.\n\n\nIn many cases the value of a product (e.g., WhatsApp) increases as more consumers use it, without any change in the product’s features or functionality. This is the direct network effect. In addition, as a product becomes a platform that connects, say, buyers and sellers (e.g., eBay), it gains from indirect network effect.\n\n\nThe two most valuable assets of a company today are its data and its customer base, yet they don’t show up in the balance sheet.\n\n\nBezos explained how Amazon shifted from selling electronics to manufacturing them: “There are two ways to extend a business … Take inventory of what you’re good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills.\n\n\nIn other words, concerts were the razors to sell music albums—the blades.\n\n\nMusic studios and artists had traditionally used concerts to generate awareness and excitement among fans in order to sell and make money on music albums. In other words, concerts were the razors to sell music albums—the blades.\n\n\nCompanies have used the razor-blade strategy for a long time: sell razors cheap to make money on the blades.\n\n\nHecht and his team found many surprising correlations. Some were hard to explain, such as that strawberries and raspberries sold far better when it was humid outside! Others made a lot of sense after some reflection. For instance, at a particular dew point, people in Dallas rush to buy bug spray … because insects’ eggs hatch at that dew point.\n\n\nYet other insights were intriguing. During bad weather, for example, women worry about logistics, such as getting kids from school or groceries from the market. For men, by contrast, the same inclement weather seems an occasion for watching sports, hosting parties, and buying beer.\n\n\nLevitt, a Harvard Business School professor, once said that people don’t buy drills; they buy holes.\n\n\nWhile a product-focused company would continue to make its drills better, a customer-focused company would think of new technologies, such as laser, which could be used to achieve the outcome (in this case, creating a hole) that the customer is looking for.\n\n\nAccenture found that payment models such as pay-per-use and power-by-the hour were preferred by an overwhelming 70 percent of consumers to the full up-front product purchase\n\n\nCoase argued that firms exist because of transaction costs. Simply put, it would be too difficult and costly for you to get up every morning and find a day’s work that was suitable to your skill.\n\n\nGE’s analysis showed that a 1 percent efficiency gain could lead to billions of incremental dollars for its customers.\n\n\nDeloitte, a consulting firm, defines business ecosystems as “dynamic and co-evolving communities of diverse actors who create and capture new value through both collaboration and competition.”\n\n\nHe went on to explain three things that are needed for markets to function properly: Markets or platforms need to provide thickness, which brings large numbers of buyers and sellers together. They need to make it safe for participants to reveal and act on confidential information they may hold. And they need to manage congestion, or competition and complexity, that arises from thickness.\n\n\nIn one of his early studies, Eric von Hippel found that 77 percent of the most important innovations in scientific instruments over four decades were developed by scientists using these instruments, and not by the scientific instrument companies.\n\n\nDietmar Harhoff confirmed von Hippel’s claim that users are the most important source of knowledge for innovations across all major technologies.18 User innovators are by definition close to their\n\n\nDietmar Harhoff confirmed von Hippel’s claim that users are the most important source of knowledge for innovations across all major technologies.\n\n\nOpen innovation is best suited for well-defined problems. You won’t get very useful insights by organizing a challenge around a broad and vague question such as “What is the future of banks?”\n\n\nUS Congress in response to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska: During cleanup, the oil-water mixture they extract from the ocean and put on barges becomes very thick and viscous in subarctic temperatures. When the barges try to unload this oil-water mixture at the shore, the process becomes very difficult and slow. As one\n\n\nChains are able to reduce inventory by 15 percent, increase order fill rates by 20 percent or more, increase revenues by 2 percent on average,\n\n\nIn the four years since its roll out, ORION has eliminated 1.6 million hours of truck idling time, and has produced an annual savings of 85 million miles in driving and 8.5 million gallons in fuel consumption.\n\n\nAs Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has often said, the goal of a company should be to remove friction for consumers, and technology should be used to do exactly that.\n\n\nGrowth is a key priority for every business, and acquiring new customers is a major driver of growth.\n\n\nYet most companies track a host of short-term metrics to assess their marketing campaigns—impressions, number of clicks, click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (from clicks to purchase), and customer acquisition cost (CAC). Of all these, CAC often becomes the key metric for managers when evaluating the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and when allocating budgets.\n\n\nAccording to the familiar 80-20 rule, 20 percent of the customers provide 80 percent of the revenue. However, research shows that if we focus on profitability instead of revenues, the rule would be 200-20, where 20 percent of the customers provide almost 200 percent of the profit!\n\n\n“The best brands consistently win two moments of truth. The first moment occurs at the store shelf, when a consumer decides whether to buy one brand or another. The second occurs at home, when she uses the brand—and is delighted, or isn’t.”\n\n\nIn 2011, Google coined the term “zero moment of truth” (ZMOT) to reflect the importance of this period of online searching before consumers show up in a store or make an online purchase.\n\n\nIn a Google study 84 percent of shoppers claimed that ZMOT shaped their decisions of which brand to buy.\n\n\nFor decades marketing textbooks have talked about the four Ps (or 4Ps): product, price, place (distribution), and promotion (or advertising).\n\n\nAdvertising people love advertising, but everyone else hates advertising.\n\n\n“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don’t know which half.” This quote, attributed to John Wanamaker, a department-store magnate in the nineteenth century, highlights a constant challenge for marketing executives.\n\n\nThe CEO of Coke in China told me a few years ago that he created a teen advisory board where he invited a few teenagers every quarter to help him get a deep understanding of their media consumption and buying behavior.\n\n\nFirst, it is very time consuming. Deloitte found that it spends over two million hours per year to do performance evaluations for its 65,000 employees.\n\n\nThoughts\n\nIt is more important for business stakeholders to focus on viable business use cases and make measurable KPIs than finding out what machine learning can be utilised for. Machine Learning is just a means to an end, not the end goal itself. Let the machine learning engineers figure out the way there, that is what they are paid to do.\nMachine learning projects fail because there are no actionable effects from the output. The output of an AI project in itself is worthless; it is the business value that matters.\n"},"AI/AI":{"slug":"AI/AI","filePath":"AI/AI.md","title":"AI","links":["AI/AI-Strategy","Data-Science/Data-Science","Data-Science/Data-Science-Project-Start-Up-Phase","Data-Science/Confident-Learning","Language/Large-Language-Models"],"tags":["article"],"content":"AI\nThis is where I write about AI and Data Science.

We tend to assosiate AI as sometihng of a co-worker, an entity that will remove jobs or talk to us like a partner. It is a common pitfall. I catch my self saying thank you to the LLM after getting a good answer. It is a tool, not a person or a pet.  It takes an input and gives an output with some degree of entropy.\nWe need to shift the discourse from the AI takes over the world to AI is a tool that can help us tremendously, but also be used to nefarious purposes. Any talk of artificial intelligence as something of a world altering threat is grounded in a baseless urge to make something into us. We should be careful to direct our policies and efforts towards combating a dragon that in reality is a windmill. If you hack at the windmill long and hard enough, it might fall down and not mill any grain no more. And as Don Quixote, the regulators will ride glorisly into the sunset as the farmers realize a critical tool that made their life so much easier has been destroyed by a self-grandazing hero.\nData Science\nI think the notes on the Data Science Project Start-Up Phase are cool; I have worked a lot on the data science aspect of projects and have learned some hard-learned lessons, and I think many of those will be interesting.\nI thought the Confident Learning topic was interesting, and I recommend going there to get more knowledge about that topic.\nLarge Language Models\nI wrote a lot about LLMs in 2023, some of which may be outdated, but it is still a good starting point for LLMs.\nLinks\n\nThe conspiracy to make AI harder than it is!\nGuides, Courses and Articles on Machine Learning focus on LLM\nAI Engineering Reading List\n\nThoughts\n\nEven though machine learning LLMs such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLama are non-deterministic.

This alteration can be due to various factors, such as shifts in data collection processes, changes in the underlying distribution of the data, or modifications in the environment from which the data originates. Detecting and addressing data drift is crucial to maintaining the performance and reliability of machine learning models and analytical systems.\nWasserstein Distance\nThe Wasserstein distance, also known as the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), is a mathematical metric that quantifies the dissimilarity between two probability distributions. It measures the minimum amount of “work” required to transform one distribution into another. In the context of comparing distributions, this “work” can be thought of as the effort needed to redistribute mass from one set of points to another, with each point carrying a certain amount of mass. Wasserstein distance only supports numerical values.\nJensen-Shannon Distance\nIn the context of data drift and probability distribution comparison, the Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance is a metric that quantifies the similarity or dissimilarity between two probability distributions. Specifically, it’s a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the difference between two distributions in terms of information content.\nThe Jensen-Shannon distance is calculated as follows:\n\nCalculate the average distribution between the two distributions by taking their arithmetic mean.\nCompute the KL divergence between each original distribution and the average distribution.\nFinally, the Jensen-Shannon distance is half the sum of these two KL divergences.\n\nThe Jensen-Shannon distance has several valuable properties, including symmetry, boundedness, and its relationship with information theory.

The transformer then processes these sequences of embeddings.\nIn 2021, a pure transformer model demonstrated better results than Convolutional Neural Networks. However, they require large amounts of data. Interpretability is also better because the attention mechanism in transformers can be inspected to understand which parts of the image are being focused on for a particular decision.\nAugmenting data\nInvariances refer to changes in the input that do not alter the output.\nIt helps enhance the robustness of a model to changes in the input data.\nEncoding, on the other hand, is the process of finding a function to represent data in a way that can be quickly processed by a machine-learning model.\nTechniques such as data augmentation for images:\n\nMobius transformations Examples of Möbius transformations (original on left), resulting in variations in perspective, orientation, and scale while still preserving local angles and anharmonic ratios.

These raw values can give insights into the model’s confidence in its predictions.\nSVM (Support Vector Machine) decision boundary distances refer to the distance of data points from the decision boundary in an SVM classifier. Points closer to the boundary are often more ambiguous or difficult for the model, whereas those farther away are more confidently classified.\n\n\n\nBenefits of Confident Learning\nUnlike most machine learning approaches, confident learning requires no hyperparameters.

To have a fighting chance of making it to production, there are several factors that are extremely important and need to be addressed.\nThe most important part is the non-technical objective functions, which can be loosely stated as:\nWhat do you want to achieve within what constraints?\nAs an example, we can use price optimization in an e-commerce setting. The first intuitive objective is to maximize the earnings from the product. But, if the constraints are not there, for example, while having a retention rate that is high enough, the objective function might lead to bad results, optimizing for single purchases.\nA great way to start ideation with the objective function is to focus on the problem and learn how to describe it, not accepting solutions by themselves.  By describing the problem, the solution can be reached as a consensus and free from legacies that lead to non-optimal results.\nAnother great way to challenge solutions comes from the first-principles methodology, where the first step is to make the requirements less dumb. This means that you ask why a lot and try to understand the requirements raison-d´etre, or reason for existence. The reason might be redundant or even harmful to solving the current problem.\nAlways challenge assumptions, and always try to remove layers until you get to the core of the problem.\nData Exploration in Start-Phase\nA big problem in data science related projects is that to understand the data and exploit it to its fullest potential, there is a need to understand the data.\nA good starting phase is to talk with business analysts and have sessions with data engineers, analysts, or others using the tools that are available. Playing around in PowerBI might give some quick intuitions about the capabilities of ML models, the data quality, and the data availability.\nIn traditional software projects, most of the responses to implementing features will be yes, but with some caveats (Might be complex, might lead to technical debt, etc.). However, with data science projects, the most common response will be maybe; it depends on the data.  Therefore, having a grasp of the data foundation can help concretize the problem statement and help data scientists explain the requirements.\nConstraints and Opportunities of Machine Learning\nBefore a machine learning project starts, it must be prioritized, and the team working on the project must be built. The key considerations in the prioritization of a machine learning project, are impact and cost.\nThe impact of using machine learning is high when,\n\nMachine learning can replace a complex part in your engineering project, or\nthere’s a great benefit in getting inexpensive (butprobably imperfect) predictions.\nThe cost of the machine learning project is highly influenced by three factors:\nThe difficulty of the problem.\nThe cost of data.\nThe needed model performance quality.\nThe progress of a machine learning project is nonlinear. The error usually decreases fast in the beginning, but then the progress slows down. Because of this nonlinearity of progress, it’s better to make sure that the client understands the constraints and the risks. Carefully log every activity and track the time it took\nA machine learning projects can fail for many reasons, and most actually do. Typical reasons for a failure are:\n\n\nLack of experienced talent,\nLack of support by the leadership.\nMissing data infrastructure.\nData labeling challenge.\nSiloed organizations and lack of collaboration.\nTechnically infeasible projects.\nLack of alignment between technical and business teams.\n\nLinks\n\nDS Project Quick Start\n\nA good note from the article: clean the Jupyter notebooks weekly and refactor code into .pyfiles instead of copy-pasting cells.

The distribution of training data does not match real-world deployment distribution. This happens for a lot of reasons. Examples are Time, over-filtering data, rare events, and convenience-based collections. (Only survey your friends or in a single location.)\nA famous empiricist once said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” In Bayesian terms, the stronger we make our model–following the excellent precepts of Jeffreys and Jaynes–the more able we will be to find the model’s flaws and thus perform scientific learning.\nConformal predictions is a machine learning framework that provides a way to quantify the uncertainty of predictions made by a model.

When using machine learning models, it is best to use a one-hot encoding.\n\nOrdinal Encoding\nOrdinal encoding is smart to use when there is some kind of systemic relationship between the values to be encoded. For example, if the size of the city might matter, you can adjust the ordinal encoding to be ranked by size. This might help the relationship. However, you could also just infer the size of the city as a feature in itself to not only imply the relationship. When doing machine learning, it might be smart to not only understand what the categories and features represent but also if any underlaid patterns affect the target.\nHashing\nHashing is a good way to keep a state of records the same, as the hash of a data set or row will always bee the same, this makes it easier to keep datasets and be consistent when having holdout-validation sets.\nEmbeddings\n\nLabel Encoding is like assigning each category a unique ID. Simple but can imply false numerical relationships.\nEmbeddings are like giving each category a unique, learnable fingerprint. More complex but can capture deeper relationships and nuances.\n\nLabel encoding and embeddings are often used together, especially in the context of neural networks. Here’s how they typically work in tandem:\nLabel Encoding First:\n\nNeural networks, and in particular embedding layers, expect numerical input. However, they cannot directly process categorical variables (like strings of port names or vessel IDs).\nLabel encoding is a preprocessing step where each unique categorical value is converted into a unique integer. This transformation is necessary because embedding layers require numerical input.\n\nFollowed by Embeddings:\n\nOnce the categorical data is converted into integers via label encoding, these integers are used as indexes to lookup vectors in an embedding matrix.\nThe embedding matrix is part of the neural network and is learned during the training process. Each row in the matrix corresponds to one category (represented by the integer from label encoding) and contains a vector that represents that category in a multi-dimensional space.\n\nWhy Use Both?\n\nDimensionality Reduction: Embedding layers effectively reduce the dimensionality of the input space. If you have thousands of categories, one-hot encoding would create a very sparse and high-dimensional input vector. Embeddings condense this information into a much smaller and denser vector.\nCapturing Relationships: Embeddings can capture more complex relationships between categories, which is not possible with just label encoding.\n\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n\n"},"AI/Data-Science/Interpretable-AI":{"slug":"AI/Data-Science/Interpretable-AI","filePath":"AI/Data Science/Interpretable AI.md","title":"Interpretable AI","links":[],"tags":["article","digital-garden"],"content":"Interpretable AI\nMachine learning models are only as interpretable as their features.

The goal of the ML Design Sprint is to decide on the goal of the model, the input features of the model, and how the model should be evaluated. The design sprint brings together Subject Matter Experts, Users, Product Owners Data Scientists, and ML Engineers together to quickly understand the problem, the potential solutions, and the risks. ML Design Sprint should shorten the duration of the scoping and exploratory analysis phases by bringing the analysts and experts together.\nDay 1 Discovery\nDay 1 should be set aside to get to know the persons, the problems, and the data.  The goal is that all participants should be familiar with what we are trying to do, and what tools we have available. Before the start of day 1, all participants should have gotten information about the exercises and the preliminary documents made on the project in order to prepare for the workshop.\nTeam Introduction and Comfort-Building Exercise\nIn this exercise, participants will have the opportunity to share their personal and professional backgrounds and experiences, while also acknowledging their current understanding of machine learning. This is aimed at creating a comfortable environment for everyone, regardless of their level of familiarity with machine learning.\nStep 1: Personal Introduction\nEach participant can share:\n\nTheir name, role in the organization, and a brief overview of their professional background.\nAny experience they have that might be relevant to the project, even if not directly related to machine learning. For example, they might have experience with data analysis, project management, domain expertise, etc.\n\nStep 2: Encounter with Machine Learning\nParticipants can discuss any exposure they have had to machine learning:\n\nAny courses, webinars, or workshops they’ve attended on machine learning.\nPersonal projects or hobbies that involved machine learning, even at a very basic level.\nTheir understanding of machine learning in their own words, even if it’s limited.\n\nStep 3: Expectations and Concerns\nParticipants can express their thoughts about the upcoming project:\n\nWhat they are most excited about for this project?\nAny apprehensions they have regarding the project, given their limited experience with machine learning.\nHow they see their current skills contributing to the project.\n\nStep 4: Learning Aspirations\nLastly, participants can share their learning aspirations:\n\nWhat they hope to learn about machine learning through the course of this project.\nHow they see this new knowledge fitting into their professional growth.\n\nThis exercise should help to create a comfortable, inclusive atmosphere where all participants, regardless of their level of machine learning knowledge, feel valued and empowered to contribute to the project. The focus on personal growth and learning aspirations also helps to instill a positive, growth-oriented mindset for the duration of the project.\nGoal\nEveryone in the team understands the team-members role and backgrounds.\nFamiliarization with Machine Learning Exercise\nOptional\nAfter introductions, it would be good to gauge the group’s understanding of machine learning. You could conduct an exercise where participants explain key ML concepts in their own words. Concepts could include:\n\nSupervised Learning\nUnsupervised Learning\nReinforcement Learning\nDeep Learning\nBias/Variance trade-off\nFeature Engineering\nModel Evaluation Metrics\nCross-Validation\nInference vs Training\nModel Serving.\n\nYou can set this up as a discussion activity, or have each participant prepare a brief explanation for a chosen concept. This exercise will allow everyone to get on the same page about basic machine learning terminology and principles.\nGoal\nAll team members have a rudimentary understanding of machine learning concepts and how it works on a high level. All team members have access to resources on machine learning and can study themselves if they want to.\nProblem Understanding Exercise\nThe next step is to get a clear understanding of the problem you’re all trying to solve.\n\nAsk participants to define the problem in their own words.\nAsk them to brainstorm the kind of data that might be useful for solving the problem.\nDiscuss the potential impact of solving this problem: how will it benefit the company, customers, or broader society?\nDiscuss potential difficulties and roadblocks that could arise during the project.\n\nThis exercise will help ensure that everyone has a good grasp of the problem and is aware of what needs to be accomplished.\nGoal\nEveryone in the team can explicitly state the problem in Machine Learning terms and why it is important to solve it. This should be documented.\nBusiness Process and Data Identification Exercise\nTo start this exercise, first, explain the business process that you’re dealing with to all participants, or if they are already familiar with it, have a brief discussion to ensure everyone is on the same page. It might be useful to visualize the process on a whiteboard or shared digital workspace, detailing the steps involved.\nStep 1: Business Process Mapping\nStart by asking the participants to map out the business process, either individually or in small groups. This should include all stages of the process, from start to finish, including inputs, outputs, and the tasks in between.\nStep 2: Identifying Potential Data Points\nOnce the process is clearly mapped out, have a group discussion to identify potential data points that could be extracted from each step of the process. These could be numerical data, categorical data, or even text data.\nFor example, in a customer service process, potential data points could be the number of customer complaints received, types of complaints, response times, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, etc.\nStep 3: Discussion on Data Quality\nAfter identifying potential data points, discuss any potential issues that might be encountered with this data. Are there likely to be missing values or outliers? If so, how might these be dealt with? Also, discuss the potential quality of the data - is it likely to be accurate and reliable? Are there any placeholder data that replaces missing values, why are those chosen?\nStep 4: Visualizing Potential Data\nOptional\nAsk the participants to visualize what the data might look like once collected. They can use hypothetical values to sketch diagrams or charts showing potential trends or patterns.\nThis exercise will help everyone understand the business process in depth and identify the potential data that could be extracted from it. It will also give everyone a better understanding of how the data they will be working with is generated and what issues they might encounter when handling it.\nGoal\nThe business process is explicitly stated in a map and actual and potential data sources identified.\nGoal Establishment Exercise\n\n\nBrainstorming Goals: Begin with an open discussion where everyone suggests what they think the goals of the project should be. Write these suggestions on a whiteboard or shared digital workspace.\n\n\nDefining SMART Goals: After you have a list of potential goals, guide the team in refining these into SMART goals:\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable,\nAchievable\nRelevant\nTime-Bound.\nFor example, “improving the model’s accuracy” could be refined to “improving the model’s accuracy to 95% on the validation set within the next two months.”\n\n\n\nPrioritizing Goals: Once you have a list of SMART goals, discuss them as a group and decide which ones are the most important. This could be based on factors like business impact, feasibility, and resources available.\n\n\nAssigning Ownership: Assign each goal to a team or individual who will be responsible for driving it forward. Make sure everyone is clear on what they need to do to achieve their assigned goals.\n\n\nThis exercise will help establish a clear, shared vision of what the team is trying to accomplish.\nGoal\nGoals for the machine learning model is established according to SMART principles.\n”How Might We” Session\nAfter the goals are established, you can move on to a “How Might We” (HMW) session. This is a method used in design thinking to turn problems into opportunities for solutions.\n\n\nIdentify Problems: Based on the goals you’ve established, identify potential problems or challenges. For example, if one of your goals is to improve model accuracy to 95%, a problem might be that the current model is overfitting to the training data.\n\n\nFormulate HMW Questions: Turn these problems into “How Might We” questions. In the above example, this could be “How might we reduce the overfitting of our current model?”\n\n\nBrainstorm Solutions: Once you have a list of HMW questions, have the team brainstorm potential solutions to each one. Encourage wild and diverse ideas - this is a chance to think outside the box.\n\n\nEvaluate &amp; Prototype: Evaluate the solutions and select a few promising ones to move forward with. Depending on the complexity of the solutions, you may want to prototype or storyboard them to get a clearer sense of how they might be implemented.\n\n\nAssign Ownership: Just as with the goals, assign ownership of each HMW question and its potential solutions to a team or individual.\n\n\nThe HMW session is a great way to foster creativity and get the team actively involved in problem-solving. By the end of it, everyone should have a clear understanding of the project’s goals and some initial ideas on how to achieve them.\nGoal\n“How might we” questions and solutions documented and ownership assigned to each one.\nDay 2 Solution\nDay 2 of the workshop will delve deeper into the analysis of the dataset and the evaluation of machine learning models. As preparation, the data scientists should conduct a preliminary exploration of the data to better understand the characteristics and potential challenges it presents. Here’s what should be looked at:\nFor numerical data:\n\nIdentify the range of values that each numerical feature can take. This will help understand the scale of these features and may hint at potential outliers.\nExamine the distribution of each feature’s values. This could indicate whether any transformation (like normalization or standardization) might be required.\nCount the number of missing (NaN) values for each feature. This is crucial as missing data can affect the performance of many machine learning algorithms.\nCompute correlations between numerical features. This could help identify redundant features or relationships that could be exploited for feature engineering.\n\nFor text data:\n\nCount the number of unique entries for each text feature. This can help identify whether the text feature is categorical or free text.\nSimilar to numerical data, identify the number of missing (NaN) values in text features.\nIf the text feature is categorical, identify the most common categories. This can give a sense of the feature’s skewness and whether any categories are particularly dominant.\nIf it is free text, consider computing some basic statistics about the text length, such as mean length, maximum length, and minimum length.\nCompute correlations between text features and numerical target variables or labels. This can be done by transforming text features into numerical ones through techniques like one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, or TF-IDF and then computing correlations.\n\nThis preliminary work will help the data scientists get a preliminary feel for the data they’re working with. It will also enable them to spot potential issues that need to be addressed, such as missing values and outliers, and to identify opportunities for feature engineering. This is used in the exercise below.\nIn-depth Data Analysis and Feature Understanding Exercise\nThis exercise will allow the participants to interact deeply with the actual dataset and understand the nuances of each feature.\nStep 1: Feature Introduction\nPresent the dataset to the participants with all its features. For each feature, discuss what it represents, its data type (numerical, categorical, ordinal, nominal, etc.), and its relevance to the business problem.\nStep 2: Feature Understanding Exercise\nNow, for each feature, ask participants to analyze it closely. They should answer questions like:\n\nWhat is the range of values this feature takes?\nAre there any obvious outliers in the data? If yes, what could be the potential reasons and how should they be handled?\nAre there any missing values? If yes, what could be the potential reasons and how should they be handled?\nHow is this feature likely to influence the outcome variable?\n\nThis can be done in the form of a group discussion, or you could divide the participants into teams and assign each team a subset of the features.\nStep 3: Feature Relationships\nAsk participants to examine relationships between features. They should consider:\n\nAre there any obvious correlations or associations between different features?\nDo any features interact with each other in a way that might impact the model?\nHow does each feature correlate with the target variable?\n\nParticipants can use visualization techniques (scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.) to aid in understanding these relationships.\nStep 4: Feature Engineering Ideas\nBased on their understanding of the features, ask the participants to brainstorm potential feature engineering opportunities. Could any features be combined, transformed, or expanded to create new, more informative features?\nThis exercise encourages an in-depth understanding of the data, helps participants appreciate the importance of feature selection and engineering, and highlights the need to handle missing values and outliers carefully.\nGoal\nThe goal of this exercise should be to have, for each feature, documented the following.\n\nWhat is the variable describing?\nWhat type of variable is it? (Categorical, Numerical, Text, etc.)\nWhat are its relationships with other variables?\nHow does the variable behave? Any extreme values?\nHow should missing values be handled? Remove, most common, etc.\n*How can new features be created using feature engineering?\n\nModel Evaluation Exercise\nThis exercise will allow participants to explore different methods to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Depending on the nature of the problem (classification, regression, etc.), various metrics and techniques could be discussed.\nStep 1: Introduction to Evaluation Metrics\nStart with a presentation on various evaluation metrics that are used for different types of machine learning problems.\nFor classification problems, introduce metrics such as:\n- Accuracy\n\nPrecision\nRecall\nArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)\nLog Loss\nConfusion Matrix\n\nFor regression problems, discuss metrics like:\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE)\nMean Squared Error (MSE)\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\nR-squared\n\nStep 2: Understanding Evaluation Metrics\nOptional\nAfter introducing these metrics, assign each participant (or a group of participants) a specific metric. Ask them to prepare a short presentation explaining how this metric is calculated when it should be used, and its pros and cons. This exercise will ensure that everyone gets a detailed understanding of at least one metric and a broad understanding of all of them.\nStep 3: Discussion on Model Evaluation Techniques\nOptional\nNext, discuss different model evaluation techniques like train-test split, K-Fold Cross-Validation, Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. Talk about the scenarios in which each technique is most useful, and discuss the pros and cons.\nStep 4: Choosing the Right Metric\nFinally, have a group discussion about what metric(s) would be most appropriate for the machine learning problem at hand. The choice of metric can depend on many factors, including the business problem, the data, the model, and the costs of different types of errors. This discussion should give participants a sense of how to make this important decision.\nThis exercise will provide participants with a solid understanding of how to evaluate machine learning models, which is crucial for ensuring that a model will perform well in practice.\nThe choice of metric should be grounded in the business problem, reflect the nature of the problem, and explain why it was chosen based on the business success criteria.\nGoal\nEvaluation metrics of the model chosen and the reason why documented."},"AI/Data-Science/Machine-Learning-Models":{"slug":"AI/Data-Science/Machine-Learning-Models","filePath":"AI/Data Science/Machine Learning Models.md","title":"Machine Learning Models","links":[],"tags":["article","digital-garden","machine-learning","machine-learning/modeling","data-science","decision-trees"],"content":"Machine Learning Models\nDecision Trees\nDeep Learning works really well for homogenous data, like images\nGradient boosting shines with small amounts of data and diverse data sources.

Here is hopefully the full list:\n\none_hot_max_size (int) - use one-hot encoding for all categorical features with a number of different values less than or equal to the given parameter value. No complex encoding is performed for such features. Default for regression task is 2.\nmodel_size_reg (float from 0 to inf) - The model size regularization coefficient. The larger the value, the smaller the model size. Refer to the Model size regularization coefficient section for details. This regularization is needed only for models with categorical features (other models are small). Models with categorical features might weight tens of gigabytes or more if categorical features have a lot of values. If the value of the regularizer differs from zero, then the usage of categorical features or feature combinations with a lot of values has a penalty, so fewer of them are used in the resulting model. Default value is 0.5\nmax_ctr_complexity - The maximum number of features that can be combined. Each resulting combination consists of one or more categorical features and can optionally contain binary features in the following form: “numeric feature &gt; value”. For regression task on CPU the default value is 4.\nhas_time (bool) - if true, the 1-st step of categorical features processing, permutation, is not performed.

Imagine it like a group of friends recommending movies to each other. If person A likes movies 1, 2, and 3, and person B likes movies 2, 3, and 4, the system might recommend movie 4 to person A and movie 1 to person B, assuming they have similar tastes.\nThis system has two main approaches:\n\n\nUser-Based Collaborative Filtering: This is like asking your friends what they’re watching. The system finds users similar to you and recommends items they liked but you haven’t seen yet.\n\n\nItem-Based Collaborative Filtering: This is more like saying, “I liked this movie, what else is like it?” The system recommends items similar to those you’ve already interacted with.\n\n\nThe key to collaborative filtering is the “wisdom of the crowd”. It assumes that if users agreed in the past, they will agree in the future. For instance, in a movie recommendation system, if two users rated many movies similarly, they will likely have similar opinions on other movies.\nContent-Based Systems\nContent-based systems recommend items by comparing the content of the items themselves and a user’s profile. The system tries to figure out what you like based on the content you’ve interacted with. For example, if you frequently watch science fiction movies, the system will recommend other movies in that genre.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nItem Profiles: Each item is characterized by a set of descriptors or terms. For movies, this might include the genre, director, actors, etc.\nUser Profiles: The system builds a profile for each user based on the characteristics of the items they have interacted with. In simple terms, it keeps track of the features you seem to prefer.\nRecommendation: The system matches user profiles with item profiles. It recommends items with content similar to what you’ve liked before.\n\nIn content-based systems, the recommendations are directly related to the user’s past behavior and do not involve other users’ preferences. This system is more personalized but can suffer from a lack of diversity in recommendations since it’s based solely on your previous actions.\nBoth systems have their strengths and weaknesses, and often, modern recommendation engines use a hybrid approach (think Netflix), combining elements of both to provide more accurate and diverse suggestions.\nWarp\nWeighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise loss (WARP loss) was first introduced in WSABIE: Scaling Up To Large Vocabulary Image Annotation by Weston et al. WARP is quite similar to BPR: you sample a positive and negative item for a user, predict for both, and take the difference. In BPR, you then make the SGD update with this difference as a weight. In WARP, you only run the SGD update if you predict wrongly, i.e., you predict the negative item has a higher score than the positive item. If you do not predict wrong, then you keep drawing negative items until you either get the prediction wrong or reach some cutoff value.\nLinks\n\nQuick Tutorial\nLightFM introduction and explanation by the person who made it. \nLearning to Rank About implicit ranking algorithms.\nPractical Recommendation Systems\n\nThoughts\n\nI have not really delved that much into predictions based on other than collaborative filtering. I wonder if you can predict the most likely next item. So you have a data set of orders. You can remove one and then try to predict the next most common item. If you have a large store, then it might be more challenging to do this as the solution matrix would be large indeed.\n"},"AI/Data-Science/Unsupervised-Learning":{"slug":"AI/Data-Science/Unsupervised-Learning","filePath":"AI/Data Science/Unsupervised Learning.md","title":"Unsupervised Learning","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Hands-On-Unsupervised-Learning-Using-Python"],"tags":["article","digital-garden","data-science","machine-learning","unsupervised-learning","data-analysis"],"content":"Unsupervised Learning\nRandom Cut Forrest\nRandom Cut Forrest can be applied to solve problems within time series analysis.

Among the most prominent LLMs are OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude, which have driven significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP).\nLLM Providers\nThere are so many LLM providers with their own subscription. Instead of hitching yourself into a single model, instead try to find places where you can use them in the context of your tool. So use cursor instead of ChatGPT for coding, etc.\nOpenRouter\nThis is an api aggregator, where chill and you can use the latest and greatest of models.\nTransformer Models\nTransformers are at the heart of modern LLMs, introduced through the seminal paper “Attention is all you need” which utilized attention mechanisms instead of traditional recurrence and convolutions.\nTypes of Transformer Models\n\n\nEncoders: These transform input sequences into context-rich representations. An example is BERT, which is used for tasks like sentence classification and named entity recognition.\n\n\nDecoders: These models generate output sequences based on encoder representations. GPT-2 is a typical decoder-only model, used for text generation.\n\n\nSequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq): These models involve both an encoder and a decoder for tasks such as summarization and translation. The encoder interprets the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output based on this interpretation.\n\n\nUsing Transformers\nThe HuggingFace Transformers API is instrumental for handling multiple or differently sized sequences through methods like batching and padding. Attention masks are used to ensure the model focuses only on meaningful parts of the input, ignoring padding or irrelevant tokens. Key terms include:\n\nSequence Length: The number of tokens in the input.\nBatch Size: The number of sequences processed in parallel.\nHidden Size: The dimensionality of the model’s representations, influencing its ability to capture complex patterns.\n\nPractical Applications and Tools\nHuggingFace Transformer Class\nHuggingFace offers a versatile module for quick NLP tasks, supporting various applications such as:\n\nZero-shot classification\nText generation\nNamed entity recognition\nText summarization\n\nLangChain\nLangChain serves as a framework for building inference with LLMs, offering functionalities to chain models or integrate them with other components. It’s a newer tool with budding but promising applications in keyword extraction and broader LLM tasks.\nOutlines\nOutlines is a framework designed for parsing and structuring data output from LLMs. It uses tools like regex to guide model outputs, improving accuracy and relevance. Less powerful models may not be as effective within this framework, emphasizing the need for model strength alignment with application needs.\nEnhancing Productivity with LLMs\nLLMs like GPT-4 have revolutionized user productivity, particularly in programming and script creation. Features like streaming responses in chatbots provide a more engaging user experience, simulating thought and response time. Moreover, the use of LLMs in daily tasks, such as recipe searching or shell scripting, showcases their versatility and user-friendliness.\nStandardizing Prompts and Outputs\nStandardizing prompts and desired output formats can significantly enhance the usability of LLMs. Tools like Alfred can be used to store and quickly retrieve standard prompts, which could be further developed to define specific output formats, improving result consistency and usability.\nCommunity and Resources\nThe community around LLMs is vibrant, with numerous resources available for those looking to delve deeper.

It was a formative experience, and the learnings from the period shaped me and how I view many things. I got to appreciate the fact that working in business is more about people than tech. I also got the advantage of having good mentors and managers. I worked four and a half years in the maritime industry. I want to write more about the maritime industry and the challenges and opportunities that face it.\nAfter working in the maritime industry for about 5 years the time was ripe for a change. I started working as a data science consultant.

I studied at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I studied at the Faculty of Marine Technology.  I mainly studied computational numerical mathematics, most of which was in a field called Computational Fluid Dynamics. I loved this field partly because I loved working on technical problems and because it was so hard.\nI remember being astonished when going into a master’s degree in engineering and thinking about all of the fantastic tools and complicated mathematical tricks I would learn and then using empirical formulas based on some experiments 40 years ago.\nBeing a Student\nBeing a student was a weird experience for me at first. Firstly, it was weird being one of the older persons at my level (I had been out of school for two years beforehand). Secondly, I had to learn how to become a good student rather than just focusing on learning my subjects.\nExams\nExams can be tricky. Some people get nervous, some get agitated. I for one, never really understood my stress level until after the fact.\nOne of the weird things was how difficult it was to get out of exam mode, and back into vacation mode. This usually took a couple of days to just get in a relaxed mood.\nExams measure what is on the exam, not what you know. This is important to comprehend, what they measure is what the examiners think is important, but also other things.\nYou might get a bad grade, based on the mood of the reviewers, they might have a bad day, have argued with their spouse, or others.\nTherefore, make no mistake: The key to good grades is to understand and know what is on the exam and know what is a good answer. That is all you need to know for good grades. If you want to actually learn, you might also succeed in getting good grades, but those two things are not the same.\nMaster thesis\nI wrote my master’s thesis on simulating fluid flow directly; it was pretty complicated. I loved working on the master’s thesis, primarily working on the code and simulation.\nThe link to my master’s thesis can be found here: Thesis\nProcess\nI think it might be helpful to mention my process. Education is a journey, and I would love to share as much of the journey and the knowledge I gained from being at the university.\nPre-Project\nDoing the pre-project for my master’s thesis was one of the most hectic and challenging times in my educational and work life. One of the issues was that there was a huge load on the other courses I took that semester, which led to some problems for me as I got overwhelmed. Many job opportunities also came in the way, and I struggled a bit to work on everything together. Furthermore, my pre-project required me to learn quite difficult simulation tools and understand the tool and supercomputing, as well as working on SSH and Python. This is also where I had my first encounter with VIM. As is customary, it ended with me turning my computer off.\nI think I almost collapsed right before the end of the project, when progress was slow as heck and I did not get any wins at all. It was quite the difficult task.\nMaster Thesis Process\nMy master’s thesis process was quite a different experience from the pre-project. I attribute the ease of writing and working on this to the following reasons.\n\nExperience\nRoutines\nSystematic approach.\nOne great starting point was that during the pre-project phase, I had gotten a lot of experience using the tools at my disposal and became much more accomplished at using them.  I felt like my work had become “easier” and that I had a lot of good experience in setting up and working diligently.\nIn my six months, focusing almost entirely on the master thesis, not being distracted, and being thorough in the work helped immensely. My progress was incrementally improving, and having a head start without significant breaks also helped.\nThe last reason was my ability to split the work into separate parts. In my master’s, I analyzed many different angles and did a “full” run for each angle. This helped a lot, as I had a lot of repetitions, which made each run more efficient and quicker.\n\nDelivery\nThe last part of the master thesis for me was just finishing up the report and investigating the results. As I did a lot of greenfield research, it was difficult for me to exactly understand what was happening, so I spent a lot of time explain how it was happening. I dont really know how useful the master thesis was. In hindsight, I would have loved to travel or focusing on other aspects of student life a bit more.\nReflections\nI think studing a hard and difficult subject is very rewarding. I felt like my work made me able to not only become very good at my subject, but also made it quite easy for me to quickly grasp difficult concepts.\nIn my work, I felt primarily that I lacked a lot of computer science skills, and that has affected a lot of my work as a data scientist.\nLinks\nThoughts\n\nThere are two types of master students: those who arrive before 10 AM and those who ask for an extension of time.\nAfter about four years of studying, I felt capable and ready for the workforce, the last year was just icing on the cake for me.\nBefore starting on a subject, go through a couple of exams and understand what they are asking about.\nI wish I had taken as many notes during my studies as I do now, it would have been awesome to have my knowledge in the garden from my studies.\nI used a lot of LateX in my studies. Never used it much outside of that.\n\n"},"About/Other":{"slug":"About/Other","filePath":"About/Other.md","title":"Other","links":[],"tags":["article","digital-garden","other","personal"],"content":"Other\nIn the other section, I want to write about stuff that is not necessarily directly related to me as a person but more stuff I can relate to but does not have a good place to live in the garden.\nLooks like In have done a good job so far, and categorised most of the things I know, or have been to lazy to actually put everything in the garden.\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n\n"},"Articles/Articles":{"slug":"Articles/Articles","filePath":"Articles/Articles.md","title":"Articles","links":[],"tags":["article","blog","interesting-reading","reading"],"content":"Articles\nList of interesting articles.

At the head of the list comes time pressure, then fear, and next comes the quality of the job or the product, leaving employee development a poor fourth.\n\n\nOur experience shows that the development of employees is the lowest priority of four criteria that cause us to adapt our leadership behavior in the moment. At the head of the list comes time pressure, then fear, and next comes the quality of the job or the product, leaving employee development a poor fourth.\n\n\n“It is an interesting feature of human psychology that, once we have found someone to blame, the quest for explanation seems to come to an end.”\n\n\n“As we look at the terrain ahead, we see that we are entering a whole new dimension. Whether you are the president of a company or the janitor, the moment you step from independence into interdependence in any capacity, you step into a leadership role.”\n\n\nA leader’s task is simple: to get the job done and to develop employees. Time and cost pressures limit the latter. Coaching is one process with both effects.\n\n\nThe single universal internal block is unfailingly unanimous: fear, variously described as fear of failure, lack of confidence, self-doubt, and lack of self-belief\n\n\nResponsibility is the other key concept or goal of coaching. It is also crucial for high performance. When you truly accept, choose, or take responsibility for your thoughts and your actions, your commitment to them rises and so does your performance.\n\n\nIf I give you advice, especially if it is unsolicited, and you take the action but it fails, what will you do? Blame me, of course, which is a clear indication of where you see the responsibility lying.\n\n\nHere is another example of the difference between the normal or imposed level of responsibility and high or chosen responsibility. Imagine a group of construction workers being briefed: “Peter, go and get a ladder. There’s one in the shed.”\n\n\nThe GROW Model: Goals, Reality, Options, and Will\n\n\nGoal setting for the session as well as the short and long term. Reality checking to explore the current situation. Options and alternative strategies or courses of action. What is to be done, When, by Whom, and the Will to do it.\n\n\nIn addition to supporting an end goal, which is not in your control, with performance and process goals, which are, goals need to be SMART: Specific Measurable Agreed Realistic Timeframed and also PURE: Positively stated Understood Relevant Ethical and CLEAR: Challenging Legal Environmentally sound Appropriate Recorded\n\n\nWhen employees begin to see each other as a support rather than a threat, they will be much happier to raise their problems. When this happens, honest diagnosis and dialogue are possible, leading to early resolution. The blame culture that prevails in the majority of businesses works against this, as it causes “false reality syndrome,” or “I will tell you what I think you want to hear, or what will keep me out of trouble.” Any corrections put in place thereafter will be based on a false reality. The wise coach starts with a more general investigation and follows the conversation of the coachee.\n\n\nThe purpose of the options stage in GROW is not to find the “right” answer, but to create and list as many alternative courses of action as possible. The quantity of options is more important at this stage than the quality and feasibility of each one.\n\n\nThe point is not to become a leader. The point is to become yourself, and to use yourself completely – all your gifts and skills and energies – to make your vision manifest. You must withhold nothing.  Warren Bennis\n\n\nCarl Jung said: “What you resist persists.” If you don’t want the same challenges to rise again and again in work, life, and love, I encourage you to turn to face the challenges that come into your life.\n\n\nReal teams (1) have clear boundaries; (2) are interdependent for some common purpose; and (3) have at least some stability of membership, which gives members time and opportunity to learn how to work together well.\n\n\nIt could be said that it is even more difficult today to get the best out of a team, for the following reasons: Global mobility brings diversity to teams which requires greater flexibility of mindset. People no longer work in settled groupings but are continually forming and reforming teams. Teams can be project based, functional, matrix based, operational, virtual, self-organized. Some teams are spread across geographical boundaries, making contact more infrequent and more problematic, or entirely virtual in nature. The timescales within which teams are expected to join, form, and perform to meet a business challenge are shorter than ever before. The business challenges themselves have increased in complexity.\n\n\nLeadership is about learning together and constructing meaning and knowledge collectively and collaboratively … It means generating ideas together; seeking to reflect upon and make sense of work in the light of shared beliefs and new information; and creating actions that grow out of these new understandings.\n\n\nManagement became about the operational, getting the job done, about the process and the present. Leadership, on the other hand, had its focus on development, vision, and the future. However, in today’s fast and complex world, the lines between management and leadership are blurred, especially when it comes to day-to-day business.\n\n\nKaizen, or “good enough never is,” is a well-known principle within Lean cultures. The belief that no process is ever perfect opens up the possibilities of continuous innovation and evolution to move toward the challenge through incremental improvement and occasional breakthroughs.\n\n\nThere’s a famous story about a presidential visit to NASA in the early 1960s when America was preparing to send people into space. President John F. Kennedy was walking down a corridor where a janitor happened to be working. The President stopped to have a chat with him and asked, “What are you doing here?” “Well, Mr. President,” he replied, “I’m helping to put a man on the moon.” That is a great example of somebody who understands that, however small their contribution might be, without that contribution it would be more difficult to achieve the overall aim. Having sight of the impact of what each person does on other people is a real key factor in teams that work interdependently.\n\n\nThere are several things that distinguish a team that is working interdependently from teams that are working at the other stages of The Performance Curve: An interdependent team recognizes the value and potential of working collaboratively, its members are much more likely to set ambitious goals. They see that more is possible. The activity that is taking place is much more likely to be focused. There is more fun, because working together with people is usually more fun than working independently or in an isolated fashion. Lots of feedback occurs, not just in one direction but in all directions, inside the immediate team and also outside it, because that creates learning. There is a high level of trust and openness. Team members are happy to have challenging conversations if that surfaces issues to enable greater performance. There is mutual accountability, so people are more likely to be catching colleagues doing things right and giving them feedback, as well as catching them doing things wrong and feeding back on that as well. There’s a greater awareness of how the team is doing and knowing how other team members are. So they’re much more likely to recognize when a challenge or some support is required. There’s a continuous emphasis on review and learning to enable improved performance on an ongoing basis.\n\n\nNon-judgment – the behaviors observed may fall below the standards required, but this can be explored in partnership to create a learning culture. • Looking for learning – there is always learning to bring out, whether the actions observed are above, at, or below expectations. • A coaching mindset – see the person as capable, resourceful, and full of potential. • Curiosity – get curious about the challenges the person is experiencing, and what is needed to overcome these. • Look for potential as well as interferences – it’s more effective to build on strengths, and where a person is already most engaged, than to focus on weaknesses.\n\n\nMeasuring the financial impacts justifies future investment. Once you can demonstrate the tangible impacts, it’s a different ball-game.  Alan Barton, Director, Arup\n\n\n*It postulates four stages of learning:\n\nUnconscious incompetence = low performance, no differentiation or understanding.\nConscious incompetence = low performance, recognition of flaws, and weak areas.\nConscious competence = improved performance, conscious, somewhat contrived effort.\nUnconscious competence = natural, integrated, automatic higher performance.\n\n\n\n“Our enjoyment of the process gave us unlimited patience, and we wrote as if the precise choice of every word were a matter of great moment.”\n\n\nToo much workplace coaching is transactional, limited to cognitive psychology, or else constrained within the principles of humanistic psychology, which maintain that awareness itself is largely curative. The Inner Game, however, reflects a transpersonal psychology which emphasizes the principle of will, intention, or responsibility. It is on this philosophy of awareness and responsibility that coaching is built.

They break down concepts, explain why they are important for the SEALS, and highlight them in the business context as well.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a good book, I think the most important lesson is that leaders take ownership. Teams and organizations are the product of their leaders.  But without a team—a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission—there can be no leadership. The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.  Most important concept of the book.\nSometimes I feel like the hard and strong stuff in military leadership can be too harsh, and one should take into account that combat is not like other situations. I think the best thing of being in highly stressful environments is the ability to focus on being stable and consistent.  “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”\nPeople who need to understand leadership as a concept should read this book. This is for those who don’t understand how empathy and responsibility are the things that matter in a leadership context.\nThe book made me reflect on the times I did not take responsibility and the fact that when I do not have too much motivation, I can be a crappy person to be around. Made me rethink a lot about the concepts of leading myself as well as other people.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nBut without a team—a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission—there can be no leadership. The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.\n\n\nFor all the definitions, descriptions, and characterizations of leaders, there are only two that matter: effective and ineffective. Effective leaders lead successful teams that accomplish their mission and win. Ineffective leaders do not.\n\n\nBeyond the literal fog of war impeding our vision, the figurative “fog of war,” often attributed to Prussian military strategist Carl von Clausewitz, had descended upon us, and it was thick with confusion, inaccurate information, broken communications, and mayhem.\n\n\nThe planning process and briefing must be a forum that encourages discussion, questions, and clarification from even the most junior personnel. If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team’s ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases. Thus, leaders must ask questions of their troops, encourage interaction, and ensure their teams understand the plan.\n\n\nOn any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.\n\n\nWhen subordinates aren’t doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates.\n\n\nIn that, lies the dichotomy: discipline—strict order, regimen, and control—might appear to be the opposite of total freedom—the power to act, speak, or think without any restrictions. But, in fact, discipline is the pathway to freedom.\n\n\nAll elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, mutually supporting one another for that singular purpose. Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them. If they forsake this principle and operate independently or work against each other, the results can be catastrophic to the overall team’s performance.\n\n\nSimplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them. And when things go wrong, and they inevitably do go wrong, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into total disaster. Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise.\n\n\nEven the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed if they try to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously. The team will likely fail at each of those tasks. Instead, leaders must determine the highest priority task and execute. When overwhelmed, fall back upon this principle: Prioritize and Execute.\n\n\nPushing the decision making down to the subordinate, frontline leaders within the task unit was critical to our success. This Decentralized Command structure allowed me, as the commander, to maintain focus on the bigger picture: coordinate friendly assets and monitor enemy activity. Were I to get embroiled in the details of a tactical problem, there would be no one else to fill my role and manage the strategic mission.\n\n\nHuman beings are generally not capable of managing more than six to ten people, particularly when things go sideways and inevitable contingencies arise.\n\n\nAs the U.S. Naval hero of the American Revolution and Father of the U.S. Navy, John Paul Jones, said: “Those who will not risk cannot win.”\n\n\n“Early in my career as a SEAL officer, there was a time when I felt that military mission planning was needless and burdensome,” I told them. “But I was wrong. Establishing an effective and repeatable planning process is critical to the success of any team.”\n\n\n“The true test for a good brief,” Jocko continued, “is not whether the senior officers are impressed. It’s whether or not the troops that are going to execute the operation actually understand it. Everything else is bullshit. Does any of that complex crap help one of your SEAL machine gunners understand what he needs to do and the overall plan for what will happen on this operation?”\n\n\nThat was far beyond most of the SEAL operators in my platoon. Yet, if I didn’t fully comprehend or appreciate the strategic impact of what we had done, how could I expect my frontline troops—my junior SEAL operators not in a leadership role—to get it? The answer: I couldn’t. For a young SEAL shooter with a very limited role in the planning process who was out working on his weapons and gear, conducting maintenance on our vehicles, or building demolition charges for the breacher, he walked into our mission briefs wondering: What are we doing next? He had no context for why we were doing the operation or how the next tactical mission fit into the bigger picture of stabilizing and securing Ramadi. I realized now that, as their leader, I had failed to explain it to them. Clearly, there was some level of strategic perspective and comprehension that would only come with time and reflection. But I could have done a far better job as a leader to understand for myself the strategic impact of our operations and passed this insight to my troops. When Jocko saw my reaction to the slide and\n\n\nAny good leader is immersed in the planning and execution of tasks, projects, and operations to move the team toward a strategic goal. Such leaders possess insight into the bigger picture and why specific tasks need to be accomplished. This information does not automatically translate to subordinate leaders and the frontline troops.\n\n\nAsk those questions up the chain to clarify, so that you can understand it. Provide them with constructive feedback so they can appreciate the impact those plans or requirements have on your operations. That is what Extreme Ownership is all about.” “I guess I never really thought about it like that,” said the field manager. “That’s ‘leading up the chain of command,’” I explained.\n\n\nI learned in SEAL training that if I wanted any extra time to study the academic material we were given, prepare our room and my uniforms for an inspection, or just stretch out aching muscles, I had to make that time because it did not exist on the written schedule. When I checked into my first SEAL Team, that practice continued. If I wanted extra time to work on my gear, clean my weapons, study tactics or new technology, I needed to make that time.\n\n\nIt all tied into discipline. By discipline, I mean an intrinsic self-discipline—a matter of personal will. The best SEALs I worked with were invariably the most disciplined. They woke up early. They worked out every day. They studied tactics and technology. They practiced their craft. Some of them even went out on the town, drank, and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. But they still woke up early and maintained discipline at every level.\n\n\nTo take charge of minute details just to demonstrate and reinforce to the team that a leader’s authority is the mark of poor, inexperienced leadership lacking in confidence.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Managing-Humans":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Managing-Humans","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Managing Humans.md","title":"Managing Humans","links":["Peopleware","Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/The-Managers-Path"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review"],"content":"Managing Humans\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA nice little book about management from an IT manager’s perspective. It is easy to read. It contains a lot of nuggets from a long career and helpful perspectives.\n🎨 Impressions\nOne thing that stuck with me is that “You are not a manager until your first layoff.”\nGood advice, I  liken it to Peopleware and The Managers Path as good books for an aspiring manager.\n“Reorgs take forever” - True.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAnother likely situation is that your manager doesn’t actually understand what you’re doing because he was never an engineer.\n\n\nI ask the same question in every interview I have: “Where do you need help?”\n\n\nMy first piece of advice to all new managers is: “Schedule one-on-ones with direct reports, keep them on the same day and time, and never cancel them.”\n\n\nPure delegators are slowly becoming irrelevant to their organizations. The folks who work for pure delegators don’t rely on them for their work because they know they can’t depend on them for action.\n\n\nThe perception of unlimited money makes people stunningly stupid, by the way.\n\n\nJust like delegation, the act of navigating politics in an organization is slippery. The difference between a manager who knows what’s going on in an organization and one who is a purely politically driven slimeball is thin. But I would take either of those over some passive manager who lets the organization happen to him.\n\n\nYour manager is not a manager until he participated in a layoff. I mean it.\n\n\nWhat I remember is that the senior VP of applications walked around the building, gathered the product team up, and then told us the straight dope about the layoff … in the hallway. This is what the layoff is about, this is who is affected, and this is when it’s happening. I’d never interacted with Rob, the VP, in my life and, come to think of it, I never really interacted with him again. Still, I think fondly of the guy because during a time of stress, he illuminated. He didn’t obfuscate.\n\n\nOver the course of two years, the team and the company exploded to close to 200 employees. This is when I discovered that growing rapidly teaches you one thing well: how communication continually finds new and interesting ways to break down.\n\n\nDo you have a one-on-one? Do you have a team meeting? Do you have status reports? Can you say no to your boss? Can you explain the strategy of the company to a stranger? Can you explain the current state of business? Does the guy/gal in charge regularly stand up in front of everyone and tell you what he/she is thinking? Are you buying it? Do you know what you want to do next? Does your boss? Do you have time to be strategic? Are you actively killing the Grapevine?   Note While I’ll explain each point from the perspective of a leader or manager, these questions and their explanations apply equally to individuals.\n\n\nThink you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would suggest one-on-ones are a bad idea, but the one-on-one is usually the first meeting that gets rescheduled when it hits the fan. I’m of the opinion that when it hits the fan, the last thing you want to do is reschedule one-on-one time with the folks who either are responsible for it hitting the fan or are the most qualified to figure out how to prevent future fan-hittage.\n\n\nI’ll talk about shortly, the Grapevine is a powerful beast, and a team meeting is a chance to kill messages it transmits. I have a standing agenda item for all team meetings that reads “gossip, rumors, and lies,” and when we hit that agenda item, it’s a chance for everyone on the team to figure out what is the truth and what is a lie.\n\n\nBullshit. The presence of rigid, e-mail-based status reports comes down to control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization.\n\n\nHere’s the deal. I believe that leaders who think they’re infallible slowly go insane with power created by the lie that being wrong is a sign of weakness\n\n\nIt’s a brutal exaggeration, but I think you should independently judge your company the same way that Wall Street does: your company is either growing or dying.\n\n\nPart of a healthy organization isn’t just that information is freely moving around; it’s what the folks receiving and retransmitting it are doing with it.\n\n\nThere is absolutely no way you’re going to prevent folks from randomly talking to each other about every bright-and-shiny thing that’s going on in your company. In fact, you want to encourage it. One-on-ones and meetings are only going to get you so far. The thing you can change is the quality of the information that’s wandering around the company.\n\n\nWithout active prevention, the Grapevine can be stronger than any individual. While you can’t kill the Grapevine, you can dubiously stare at it when it shows up on your doorstep and simply ask the person delivering it, “Do you actually believe this nonsense\n\n\nThere are two useful types of meetings: alignment meetings and creation meetings. Briefly, alignment meetings are tactical communication exchanges that rarely dive into the strategic. These are fine meetings that have a weekly cadence, and while there are lots of ways to screw up these meetings, their tactical repetition often keeps them on the rails.\n\n\nCreation meetings—diving into solving a hard problem—involve, well, more creativity. Each hard problem requires a unique solution, and finding that solution is where creation meetings can go bad.\n\n\nA meeting has two critical components: an agenda and a referee. Let’s start with the obvious—the agenda. The agenda answers the question everyone is wondering as they sit down: how do I get out of this meeting so I can actually work?\n\n\nThe other component is the referee. I originally thought the owner was the critical component, and while an absent owner is certainly a meeting red flag, the lack of a referee is a guaranteed disaster.\n\n\nReferee’s job is to shape the meeting to meet the requirements of the agenda and the expectations of the participants.\n\n\nA referee’s job is to shape the meeting to meet the requirements of the agenda and the expectations of the participants.\n\n\nIf they’re doing anything except listening, they aren’t listening.

One of the first lessons a new manager discovers, either through trial and error or instruction, is that the approaches they used for building products aren’t going to work when it comes to people.\n\n\nThe ability to listen to random stories and quickly tease out a flaw in the logic or the absence of a critical dependency is just one of the skills you need to develop as a manager.\n\n\nYour job in a one-on-one is to give the smallest voice a chance to be heard, and I start with a question: “How are you?”\n\n\nHow Are You? It’s a softball opener. I recognize that, but I lead with a vanilla opener because this type of content-free question is vague enough that the recipient can’t help but put part of themselves into the answer, and it’s the answer where the one-on-one begins.\n\n\nYou get exactly what you expect from the Update—it’s status. These are my projects and these are my people and this is how it’s going down. I believe most folks consider this type of one-on-one to be a success, and they’re wrong.\n\n\nIf someone is going to freak out, it’s going to be on a Monday.\n\n\nIt’s called the Fall because in an instant the normally predictable floor upon which you stand vanishes and you enter a mental free fall where you feel like throwing up because you no longer know which way is up.\n\n\nWhen communications are down, listen hard, repeat everything, and assume nothing.\n\n\nAgenda detection starts by first classifying the participants. There are two major types that you need to identify: players and pawns. The simple distinction between the two types is that players want something out of the meeting.\n\n\nThe next step in agenda detection now kicks in as we look at the players. This is when you figure out each player’s position relative to the issue on the table. For whatever that issue is there are two subclasses of players: the pros and the cons.\n\n\nMeetings are always going to be inefficient because language is hard.\n\n\nYour job as a manager is to move the team forward without hurting morale.\n\n\nThere are three distinct phases to the mandate: Decide, Deliver, and Deliver (Again). Since you are the ultimate decision maker regarding this particular matter, we’re going to call this a local mandate. These are opposite of foreign mandates, which we’ll talk about later.\n\n\nThe creation of information is the act of creating context and foundation when there is none. Call it a rumor or gossip, but what it really is is a reaction to a failure to communicate. When I hear a fantastic piece of gossip, I’m listening for two things. First, what is actually being said, and second, what informational gap in knowledge is being filled by this fantastic fabrication.\n\n\nBack to the rock star who thinks she’s about to be fired. Given that I know there is no chance she’s about to be fired, what am I hearing? First, I’m hearing, “I don’t know where I stand in the organization.” It’s not that she actually thinks she’s going to be fired—she doesn’t understand her value. Second, I’m hearing, “Given that I don’t know my value, I’m going to make up a crazy consequence, which isn’t actually likely, but boy, will it get someone’s attention\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest loss of essential information is when managers rely on their brains as to-do lists.\n\n\nHad an engineer who faithfully kept a running diary of who our new customers were, and, after a few months, he knew more about our customer base than most of our sales folks.\n\n\nNow, the point of a performance review is not the review itself but the conversation that stems from it.\n\n\nThe story is, “Did you know it’s a statistical fact that people with larger feet tend to be better spellers? [Insert awe.] It’s because people with bigger feet are older.”\n\n\nFact #3: Process defines communication.\n\n\nFact #5: You don’t have a company until you have a product.\n\n\nWe’re addicted to quick fixes, top-ten lists, and four-hour work weeks, but the truth is that if it wasn’t hard, everyone would be doing it, and a hard thing is never done by reading a list or a book or an article about doing it. A hard thing is done by figuring out how to start.\n\n\nAsk dumb questions. Your first job when faced with ignorance is information acquisition, and, hopefully, there are folks out there who’ve already done some soaking. These folks have some facts, ideas, and opinions regarding whatever the problem might be, and you need to hear them all.\n\n\nMy advice regarding flame-o-grams and hard decisions is the same. Sleep on it.\n\n\nA night’s rest is one of the best ways to calm and alter your perspective on a problem. Ever gone to bed at night when the sky is falling and awoken to a blissfully simple way to easily prop the sky up? How’d that happen?\n\n\n“Seemingly insignificant events that are intent on screwing you in an unlikely way.” These events are named after Ian Malcolm, as they are called Malcolm events.\n\n\nMy normal approach when faced with an impossible task is analysis, because analysis gives you data, which in turn allows you to make a confident decision.\n\n\nOnce you’ve kicked yourself out of stop, iterate becomes a little easier, but if you’re truly tackling an impossible task, the Critic simply isn’t going to shut up.\n\n\nEntropy Always Wins\n\n\nHackers are allergic to process not because they don’t understand the value; they’re allergic to it because it violates their core values.\n\n\nThese values are well documented in Zuckerberg’s letter: “Done is better than perfect,” “Code wins arguments,” and “Hacker culture is extremely open and meritocratic.”\n\n\nYou call on the motivation and retention police because you believe they can perform the legendary “diving save.” Whether it’s HR or a well-intentioned manager with a distinguished title, these people scurry impressively. Meetings that go long into the evening are instantly scheduled with the disenfranchised employee.\n\n\nThey’ve quit, and when someone quits they are effectively saying, “I no longer believe in this company.” What’s worse is that what they were originally thinking was, “I’m bored.”\n\n\nWhether someone is bored or not, you always need to be able to answer two questions regarding each person on your team: 1.  Where are they going? 2.  What are you currently doing to get them there?\n\n\nPart of your credibility as a leader is your public and repeated declaration that it’s your job to help your team succeed, but you have another task: you need to keep building stuff.\n\n\nEveryone on the team needs to interview every candidate.\n\n\nInterviewing is a team sport and failing to get everyone’s perspective regarding a candidate is not only a lost opportunity in terms of gathering some random piece of perspective, but it also sends an implied message to the team when Dave gets excused\n\n\nYour second bellwether is cultural. They’ve got two aspects of the candidate that they need to assess. First, cultural fit within the team, and second, cultural fit within the company.\n\n\nA strategic hire is someone who is going to push their agenda, their opinion. They are actively engaged in what they are doing, networking with others who do it, and they’ll tell anyone, at length, about how they’re going to do it. Strategic hires are going to piss people off because of the annoying intensity of their agenda.\n\n\nA tactical hire is a person who is filling a well-defined need. “We need a database guy.” Like strategics, tacticals know their stuff, but that’s all that they know. Also, they’re not that interested in pushing an agenda. They just want to get their work done in relative silence.\n\n\nMeetings are power struggles between those who want something and those who don’t want to give it to them. If you’re walking into a meeting and you need something, your first job is to identify this person. This person is the reason the meeting is happening, and if you don’t know who they are, you’re missing essential subtext. It’s actually pretty easy. Just wait for someone to say something controversial and see who everyone looks at.\n\n\nA useful meeting is not a speech; it’s a debate.\n\n\nIncrementalists drink a lot of coffee because of their addiction to motion. Getting lost in this addiction means that incrementalists never finish a thing. They have no concept of “done,” because done would mean no more motion and who wants to stop?\n\n\nCompletionists drink a lot of coffee because of their addiction to thought. Unlike incrementalists, these completionists aren’t actually saying anything because they’re deeply considering the problem.\n\n\nLove this guy. Best manager ever. I still talk to him on a monthly basis because this guy taught me everything I know about what I do. He is my mentor. Mostly harmless. This guy doesn’t really challenge me, but then again, he’s not really slowing me down. I’m not learning much, but I don’t have to put up with much bullshit. Also, I’m not sure what he actually does, but he leaves me alone … so … whatever. Worst. Manager. Ever. This guy makes my life a living hell. I dread our weekly one-on-one. I prepare for an hour and we still end up talking about random useless crap.\n\n\nAs an aside, let me stress how bad of a career move it is to not know who you are going to be working for when you arrive.\n\n\nLike it or not, your boss has as much effect on your career as you do, and they also effectively sign your paycheck every two weeks, and that means food.\n\n\nWhat you need to know about your manager is how much he cares about this growth and, more importantly whether he sees this as his growth opportunity or the team’s.\n\n\nTitled “1.0,” but its actual title should be, “1.0 spelled one point oh my god I’m never going to see my family again.” I’ll summarize: 1.0 is incredibly hard,\n\n\nReorgs take forever.\n\n\nReorganizations represent opportunity to those who are unhappy with the state of the current organization. As mentioned above, the moment stakeholders hear that there is a reorg brewing, they start working the grapevine to steer the course of the reorg in their favor.\n\n\nYou’re resigning, you’ll be tempted to overcommit on deliverables because you’re leaving.\n\n\nIf you’re resigning, you’ll be tempted to overcommit on deliverables because you’re leaving.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/The-Managers-Path":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/The-Managers-Path","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Leadership/The Managers Path.md","title":"The Managers Path","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","management","leadership","tech-lead","technology"],"content":"The Manager’s Path\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is for technical people who aspire to become great leaders. Camille goes through her experiences and discusses what is required of you at each step of the ladder to management. She discusses how to act as a technical manager, how to interact with people and direct reports and identify issues.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked it, it was well-written. I think this is a good book to reference from time to time when you are on the tech-lead, manager path.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIf you are interested in improving on purely the people management side of leadership, books like First, Break All the Rules are good starters\n\n\nWhen you are interested in being promoted, it’s very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion. Managers usually cannot guarantee promotions, but good managers know what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills.\n\n\nThe very first thing you need to learn is how to work. Maybe you know this already, but when I was first out of college, I didn’t really know how to do the job at all. Because the day-to-day work of tech is very different from school, there are probably a bunch of things you will learn about the process of being a working engineer.\n\n\nAlso advise you to find the best managers and mentors you can, and watch them work. Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success,\n\n\nSome offices, whether in a mentoring relationship or outside of one, you’ll encounter an “alpha geek.” The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. The alpha geek values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits, and believes these attributes should determine who gets to make decisions. The alpha geek usually can’t deal with dissent, and is easily threatened by those she perceives as trying to steal her spotlight or who might upstage her.\n\n\nThe alpha geek is usually an excellent, effective engineer who goes into management either because she was pushed into it or because she believes that the smartest person on the team should be the manager.\n\n\nMentoring, when done well, starts to shape the skills every future leader needs. Even for those who won’t go on to make management their career, there are clear benefits to taking some time to mentor and learn from the experience, because mentoring forces you to hone your communication skills.\n\n\nSenior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who disagrees with what they are saying\n\n\nTech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code.\n\n\nMy job as tech lead was to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process.\n\n\nA leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team. - Definition of a tech lead\n\n\nSystems architect and business analyst In the systems architect and business analyst roles, you identify the critical systems that need to change and the critical features that need to be built in order to deliver upcoming projects.\n\n\nThe Stone of Triumph is a metaphor for achieving recognition only to discover that recognition comes with a heavy price.\n\n\nDoesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project management? No. Agile software development is a great way to think about work because it forces you to focus on breaking tasks down into smaller chunks, planning those smaller chunks out, and delivering value incrementally instead of all at once.\n\n\nThe process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems. Process czars may be obsessed with agile, Kanban, scrum, lean, or even waterfall methods.\n\n\nProcess czars are often found in QA, helpdesk, or product management groups. They’re also common in consulting agencies and other places where measurement of specific work progress is highly rewarded.\n\n\nProcess czars struggle when they fail to realize that most people are not as good at following processes as they are. They tend to blame all problems on a failure to follow the best process, instead of acknowledging the need for flexibility and the inevitability of unexpected changes.\n\n\nNew engineering managers think of the job as a promotion, giving them seniority on engineering tasks and questions. This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.\n\n\nOne strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well. These questions might include: How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?  Some people really hate to be praised in public. You want to know this.  What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?  Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?  How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?  Maybe a direct report fasts for religious reasons, which sometimes makes him cranky. Maybe he always gets stressed out while on-call. Maybe he hates reviews season.  Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?  If you asked me this question, my answer would be: skipping or rescheduling 1-1s, neglecting to give me feedback, and avoiding difficult conversations.  Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?  Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about?  Things like: Where are my stock options? You promised me a relocation bonus and I haven’t gotten it yet. Why are we using SVN and not Git? I didn’t expect to be so productive already!\n\n\nFor more ideas, see Lara Hogan’s excellent blog post on the topic.\n\n\nMy goal in a 1-1 is first to listen to anything my direct reports want to discuss. I want the meeting to be driven by them, and I want to give them space to bring up whatever they feel is important. I view a 1-1 session as much as a creative discussion as a planning meeting.\n\n\nAutonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. This is why micromanagers find it so difficult to retain great teams.\n\n\nAs situations arise, use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently. When things are going well, praise them, but also make suggestions as to what could be even better in the future.\n\n\nThe 360 model is a performance review that includes feedback from, in addition to a person’s manager, his teammates, anyone who reports to him, and coworkers he regularly interacts with, as well as a self-review.\n\n\nFurthermore, if you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as technically credible. Without technical credibility you face an uphill battle, and even though you may be able to get into a position of leadership in one company, your options will be limited.\n\n\nMy advice is to dedicate 20% of your time in every planning session to system sustainability work (“sustainability” instead of the more common “technical debt”).\n\n\nThe challenge of the brilliant jerk is that she’s probably been rewarded for a very long time for her brilliance, and she clings to it like a life raft.\n\n\nThese days, most places claim that they don’t tolerate brilliant jerks, but I personally don’t believe that is true. It’s incredibly hard for a manager to justify getting rid of someone who produces great work, even though she’s a drain on everyone around her — especially if this person is only irregularly a jerk.\n\n\nYou have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter\n\n\nBudget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board\n\n\nBy “generic sustaining engineering work,” I mean testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, and doing other work that has to happen. If you make this a habit, you can use it to tackle some of the midsize legacy code every quarter and get decent improvements.\n\n\nAs you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no\n\n\nUse the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks\n\n\nThe popular doubling rule of software estimation is, “Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.” This rule is appropriate and good to use when you’re asked for an off-the-cuff guess.\n\n\nBe selective about what you bring to the team to estimate\n\n\nPart of the reason that I stress your role in this estimation and planning process is that it’s distracting and stressful for engineers to have a manager who’s constantly asking them for random project estimates.\n\n\nYou’ll start to recognize the early warning signs of projects that are going poorly, people who are getting ready to quit, and teams that are underperforming.\n\n\nYou think carefully about dropping out of meetings, and part of the reason is that those meetings are where you learn what healthy and unhealthy dynamics look like.\n\n\nThe person who is usually chatty, happy, and engaged suddenly starts leaving early, coming in late, taking breaks to leave during the workday, staying quiet in meetings, and not hanging out on chat.\n\n\nThe tech lead claims that everything is going well, but skips your 1-1s frequently and rarely provides detail in his status updates.\n\n\nThe team has absolutely no energy at all in their meetings. In fact, the meetings feel like a total slog,\n\n\nThe team’s project list seems to change every week, depending on the customers’ whims that day.\n\n\nI love Larry Wall’s idea that “laziness, impatience, and hubris” are virtues of engineers,\n\n\nWhether you have experienced managers or first-timers reporting to you, there is one universal goal for these relationships: they should make your life easier. Your managers should allow you to spend more time on the bigger picture, and less time on the details of any one team.\n\n\nIn his book High Output Management,1 Andy Grove talks about cultural values as one of the ways that people make decisions inside of highly complex, uncertain, or ambiguous circumstances where they value the group interest above their own.\n\n\nHis observation is that most new hires act in self-interest until they get to know their colleagues, and then they move into group interest. So, if you start them in a highly complex or uncertain job, they tend to fail unless they quickly settle into the cultural norms and use cultural values to align their decision making.\n\n\nDedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” This means allowing time for refactoring, fixing outstanding bugs, improving engineering processes, doing minor cleanup, and providing ongoing support.\n\n\nUnderstand how important various engineering projects really are. Product and business projects usually have some kind of value proposition to justify them.\n\n\nAssessing Your Own Experience How often do you talk to your skip-level reports? Do you meet with them one on one, or as groups? How do you proactively reach out to your teams? How much time do you spend seeking out information, instead of passively handling the information that comes to you? When was the last time you sat in on a team meeting?  Without looking at your existing documentation, write down your view of the job description for the engineering managers who report to you.  What are they responsible for? How do you evaluate them? What areas are most important for success, in your opinion? Now, look at the job description your company uses. Are there differences in what you wrote compared to that description, or do they match well? Given that description, what things are you potentially overlooking in evaluating them?  Finally, do a quick mental review of their current performance. What areas need coaching and development? Make time to cover this in your next 1-1.  If you manage an area that is outside of your technical comfort zone, how often do you check in on that area to make sure things are going well? Have you taken some time to learn from the manager of that area a little bit about what it takes to succeed in that role? What new things have you learned in the past three months that help you understand that team better?  If you have one team that is clearly operating more smoothly than others, what are the differences you notice in their processes? Their interactions? Is their manager doing things differently than other managers? How does the team interact with that manager, and how does that manager interact with you?  What is your interview process for managers? Do you spend time talking about their personal values and their management philosophy? Do you have the team interview their potential manager, or do you keep them out of the process? Do you spend time getting references for candidates?  What are your organization’s goals this quarter? This year? How are you merging product goals (if any) with the technical goals? Does your organization have a mandate that is well understood by the teams?\n\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that my job wasn’t to be the smartest person in the room. It wasn’t to be “right.” Rather, my role was to help the team make the best possible decisions and help them implement them in a sustainable and efficient way.\n\n\nMany problems will get raised to you and then resolved on their own, so you may decide you need a degree of sustained struggle from your team before it’s time to step in. I’m not recommending that you adopt the “three-times rule” as a policy, but it does tend to happen, whether you plan for it or not.\n\n\nOverall structure. When I talk about senior leadership, I emphasize strategy as a critical element.\n\n\nHow do you know if you’re creating a culture of fear? It can come from placing a high value on being correct and following the rules, and having a strong affinity for hierarchy-based leadership. I also believe that coming from places where conflict was openly tolerated, if not actively encouraged, made me even more likely to create this culture.\n\n\nThis role, played by the senior leader of a functional area (the CTO plays it for technology, the CFO plays it for finance, etc.), sets the baseline of what excellence looks like in this function. I call it “True North.”\n\n\nTrue North represents the core principles that a person in a functional role must keep in mind as he does his job. For a product leader, True North includes thinking of the users and their needs first and foremost, measuring and experimenting as much as possible, and pushing back on projects that don’t address the stated goals of a team.\n\n\nLeadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box\n\n\nDaring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead\n\n\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful\n\n\nWhen talking about structure with skeptics, I try to reframe the discussion. Instead of talking about structure, I talk about learning. Instead of talking about process, I talk about transparency. We don’t set up systems because structure and process have inherent value.\n\n\nOne of the greatest writings about organizational politics is a piece called “The Tyranny of Structurelessness” by Jo Freeman. While the article is about early feminist/anarchist collectives, Freeman’s insights apply equally well to startup culture.\n\n\nPretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication.\n\n\nUnstructured group can, in fact, work: It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.  It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to insure that participants have a “common language” for interaction. People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising group where each can learn from the others’ experience, but too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other’s behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, they can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.  There is a high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily.\n\n\nThere is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, people become interchangeable parts.\n\n\nEarliest startup as like driving a race car. You’re close to the ground, and you feel every move you make. You have control, you can turn quickly, you feel like things are moving fast. Of course, you’re also at risk of crashing at any moment, but you only take yourself down if you do. As you grow, you graduate to a commercial flight. You’re farther from the ground, and more people’s lives depend on you, so you need to consider your movements more carefully, but you still feel in control and can turn the plane relatively quickly. Finally, you graduate to a spaceship, where you can’t make quick moves and the course is set long in advance, but you’re capable of going very far and taking tons of people along for the ride.\n\n\nA complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. Your company started as a very simple system that contained a few people, and as more and more people and rules and infrastructure were added, it evolved into a complex system.\n\n\nA complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.\n\n\nMy advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing it.\n\n\nAs humans, we tend to blame failure on bad luck until it’s impossible to ignore our own contributions to that failure.\n\n\n“Organizations which design systems…are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”\n\n\nWhen we put cross-functional teams together, we are acknowledging that the most important communication — the communication that we need to favor above all else — is that which leads to effective product development and iteration.\n\n\nThink of process as risk management. As your teams and systems grow, it’s almost impossible for any one person to keep the systems in her head. Because we have a bunch of people coordinating work, we evolve processes around that work coordination in order to make risks obvious.\n\n\nOne way to think about engineering processes is that they serve as a proxy for how hard or rare it needs to be for something to happen.\n\n\nBe clear about code review expectations. For the most part, code reviews don’t catch bugs; tests catch bugs.\n\n\nUse a linter for style issues. Engineers can waste absurd amounts of time on questions of style, specifically formatting.\n\n\nKeep an eye on the review backlog. Some companies implement a limit on how many outstanding review requests a person can have assigned to him, and they block that person from requesting review when he has too many outstanding requests.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Turn-the-Ship-Around":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Turn-the-Ship-Around","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Leadership/Turn the Ship Around.md","title":"Turn the Ship Around","links":["History/Europe/How-the-War-was-Won"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","leadership","military","seafaring","uboat","management","education"],"content":"Turn the Ship Around\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the leadership-leadership principle, where leaders are encouraged to enable other leaders below them in the hierarchy to evolve and take ownership. This book contains the implementation of the leader-leader principle onboard a nuclear submarine and how it went.\n🎨 Impressions\nOne of the most important things to understand from this book is how to enable your reports to take ownership and leadership of their jobs and responsibilities.\nI enjoyed reading about the importance of immediate recognition of the top performers and would like to include it if I can.\nAlso, interesting tidbits about the US submarine force and it is closely linked to How the War was Won book and how it describes the massive effect of air-sea power.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nHe is not alone. A recent survey indicated that 44 percent of business leaders reported their disappointment in the performance results of their employees\n\n\nThe leader-leader structure is fundamentally different from the leader-follower structure. At its core is the belief that we can all be leaders and, in fact, it’s best when we all are leaders.\n\n\nThird, I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization. Ships with a “good” commanding officer (CO) did well, as had the SSBN I rode. Ships that didn’t have a good CO didn’t do well.\n\n\nIt is precisely the success of the top-down, leader-follower structure that makes it so appealing. As long as you are measuring performance over just the short run, it can be effective.\n\n\nIn your organization, are people rewarded for what happens after they transfer?\n\n\nAt our submarine schools, the instructors tell us that officers make sure we do the right things and chiefs make sure we do things right.\n\n\nSadly, a common joke on Santa Fe was “Your reward is no punishment.”\n\n\nLater, I would call this “eyeball accountability.” It would mean being intimately involved—physically present in most cases—in the operations of the ship and in each activity.\n\n\nSubordinates generally desire to present the boss with a “perfect” product the first time. Unfortunately, this gets in the way of efficiency because significant effort can be wasted.\n\n\nIs your staff spending time and money creating flawless charts and reports that are, simultaneously, irrelevant?\n\n\nThe Navy’s experience at the beginning of World War II was that too many submarine crews and captains took their peacetime practices into war with them. The result was overly cautious operations that failed to inflict significant damage on the enemy.\n\n\nTHINK OUT LOUD is a mechanism for CONTROL because when I heard what my watch officers were thinking, it made it much easier for me to keep my mouth shut and let them execute their plans.\n\n\nFor example, during World War II, the submarine force, while only making up 2 percent of the Navy, sank over 50 percent of all Japanese vessels sunk.\n\n\nA briefing is a passive activity for everyone except the briefer. Everyone else “is briefed.” There is no responsibility for preparation or study.\n\n\nWe let our administrative processes get in the way of prompt recognition. Many times we would submit awards three months prior to the departure of a sailor, only to find ourselves calling during the last week to track down the award before his departure. When I say immediate recognition, I mean immediate. Not thirty days. Not thirty minutes. Immediate.\n\n\nDo you have a recognition and rewards system in place that allows you to immediately applaud top performers?\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Never-Split-the-Difference":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Never-Split-the-Difference","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Never Split the Difference.md","title":"Never Split the Difference","links":["Communication/Communication","Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Nonviolent-Communication"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","negotiation","communication","job"],"content":"Never Split the Difference\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about negotiating and the human aspect of negotiating.  It recounts stories of hostage negotiating and other experiences less threatening and tells how this helps you become a better negotiator.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a good book, very easy to read and digest. I liked it quite well. The techniques are clear and understandable, and I would like to use them.\nI liked that there were a lot of concrete discussions around negotiating and techniques that were quite clear.\nIt might be worth looking into the Communication page for more.\nIt might have some similarities to Nonviolent Communication\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nHow he would solve my problems. To every threat and demand he made, I continued to ask how I was supposed to pay him and how was I supposed to know that my son was alive.\n\n\nFeeling, they discovered, is a form of thinking.\n\n\nThere’s the Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed\n\n\nIt was clear: if emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational.\n\n\nGood negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.\n\n\nThe less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa).\n\n\nOften those on both sides of the table are doing the same thing, so you have what I call a state of schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their head\n\n\nInstead of prioritizing your argument—in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say—make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.\n\n\nTalking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I’m in control. When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you’ve brought in a measure of uncertainty.\n\n\nMirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other.\n\n\nThe results were stunning: the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement.\n\n\n*If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there’s another way without all the mess. It’s just four simple steps:\n\n.​Use the late-night FM DJ voice.\n​Start with “I’m sorry …”\nMirror.\nSilence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.\n​Repeat.\n\n\n\nThe intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.”\n\n\nEvery time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. They will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first time.\n\n\nThe language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport: a way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together.\n\n\nLabeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels. It gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about (“How’s your family?”). Think of labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack.\n\n\nLabeling is a tactic, not a strategy, in the same way a spoon is a great tool for stirring soup but it’s not a recipe.\n\n\nIn any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation. Whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human interaction.\n\n\nBehavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM). The model proposes five stages—active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change—that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.\n\n\nEffective Pauses: Silence is powerful. We told Benjie to use it for emphasis, to encourage Sabaya to keep talking until eventually, like clearing out a swamp, the emotions were drained from the dialogue.\n\n\n“No deal is better than a bad deal.” If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients begin to believe they’ve got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon.\n\n\nThat’s because having a deadline pushes you to speed up your concessions, but the other side, thinking that it has time, will just hold out for more.\n\n\nMoore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It’s true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of impasse.\n\n\nProspect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion\n\n\nThe F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you’re mistreating them.\n\n\nInstead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem. I thought to myself, This is perfect! It’s a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact. It’s a “how” question, and “how” engages because “how” asks for help.\n\n\nAnd the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.\n\n\nThe 7-38-55 rule. That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face. While these figures mainly relate to situations\n\n\n-38-55 rule.

That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.\n\n\nThe Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you’re trying to drill into at the moment.\n\n\nHarvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra and his coauthors found that, on average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than I, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie.\n\n\nThe more in love they are with “I,” “me,” and “my” the less important they are. Conversely, the harder it is to get a first person pronoun out of a negotiator’s mouth, the more important they are.\n\n\nMost of all, the Assertive wants to be heard. And not only do they want to be heard, but they don’t actually have the ability to listen to you until they know that you’ve heard them.\n\n\n*The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method, at least on the surface. But it is a very effective system for beating the usual lackluster bargaining dynamic, which has the predictable result of meeting in the middle. The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps:\n\n​Set your target price (your goal).\n​Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.\n​Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).\n​Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.\n​When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, 37,893 rather than 38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight. 6.​On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.\n\n\n\n*Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style. Once you know whether they are Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you’ll know the correct way to approach them.\n\nPrepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion; you fall to your highest level of preparation. So design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses you’ll use to get there. That way, once you’re at the bargaining table, you won’t have to wing it.\n​Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you’re not ready, you’ll flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.\nSet boundaries, and learn to take a punch or punch back, without anger. The guy across the table is not the problem; the situation is.\nPrepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re worth when you’re really getting to the number you want.\n\n\n\nIn theory, leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of information, we are told, and you’ll build leverage over the other side’s perceptions, actions, and decisions.\n\n\nPositive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants. Whenever the other side says, “I want …” as in, “I want to buy your car,” you have positive leverage.\n\n\nNegative leverage is what most civilians picture when they hear the word “leverage.” It’s a negotiator’s ability to make his counterpart suffer. And it is based on threats: you have negative leverage if you can tell your counterpart, “If you don’t fulfill your commitment/pay your bill/etc., I will destroy your reputation.” This sort of leverage gets people’s attention because of a concept we’ve discussed: loss aversion. As effective negotiators have long known and psychologists have repeatedly proved, potential losses loom larger in the human mind than do similar gains.\n\n\nNormative leverage is using the other party’s norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage. No one likes to look like a hypocrite.\n\n\n“Negotiations with religious fanatics who have delusions of grandeur generally do not go well.”\n\n\nFinding the Black Swans—those powerful unknown unknowns—is intrinsically difficult, however, for the simple reason that we don’t know the questions to ask. Because we don’t know what the treasure is, we don’t know where to dig.\n\n\n*Let what you know—your known knowns—guide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he did.\n\n\n​Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart’s norms to bring them around).\n\n\nWork to understand the other side’s “religion.” Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live.\n\n\nReview everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss.\n\n\nExploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground.\n\n\nWhen someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren’t. Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Start-with-No":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Start-with-No","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Negotiations/Start with No.md","title":"Start with No","links":[],"tags":["negotiation","books","book-review","non-fiction","salary-negotiation"],"content":"Start with No\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about negotiations but slowly becomes a self-help book.

It’s just a cop-out. Focus instead on your activity and behavior. • The temptation to “close” is powerful and in some businesses, like real estate, almost ingrained. You must keep a sharp eye.

When the owner emerges, the American asks the owner about one particular animal. The Bedouin replies, “Oh, that’s my son’s camel, his pet. I couldn’t sell that one.” The American looks nonplussed, climbs back into his Range Rover, and starts to drive off.

If necessary, cancel the meeting or don’t make the phone call.\n\n\n\nThe people on the other side are negotiating for their benefit, not for yours. This is self-evident but often overlooked, and it’s the reason your mission and purpose must be rooted in the world of the other side and bring benefits that solve their problems.\n\n\nIn negotiations, you must have a vision of a current or future problem to be solved. It’s just that simple. This is why you’re negotiating.\n\n\nThree-Minute Checklist • Are you certain you clearly see the problems on the other side?

Express yourself through describing how you feel rather than what is affecting you.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a bit of a 60s vibe of the book, it was not a particularly gripping read, but I thought it was a cool book all in all. The point is maybe being better at communicating and maybe i should try to think about this more and being better at following through on the advice. Sometimes I feel like communication is like driving a motorbike, you have to train your brain to do things that it is conditioned to avoid. And just like on a motorcycle, if you do the conditioned thing you crash.\nThis book is the last in a long line of books where I read about communicating and hope that I can condition myself to be a better one.

It is a language rich with words that classify and dichotomize people and their actions.\n\n\nClassifying and judging people promotes violence.\n\n\nWe deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves:\n\n\nIn her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, which documents the war crimes trial of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann, Hannah Arendt quotes Eichmann saying that he and his fellow officers had their own name for the responsibility-denying language they used. They called it Amtssprache, loosely translated into English as “office talk” or “bureaucratese.”\n\n\n“OBSERVE!! There are few things as important, as religious, as that.” —Frederick Buechner, minister\n\n\nWhen we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.\n\n\n“Our language is an imperfect instrument created by ancient and ignorant men. It is an animistic language that invites us to talk about stability and constants, about similarities and normal and kinds, about magical transformations, quick cures, simple problems, and final solutions. Yet the world we try to symbolize with this language is a world of process, change, differences, dimensions, functions, relationships, growths, interactions, developing, learning, coping, complexity. And the mismatch of our ever-changing world and our relatively static language forms is part of our problem.”\n\n\nThe Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence.\n\n\nCountry singer Reba McEntire wrote a song after her father’s death, and titled it “The Greatest Man I Never Knew.” In so doing, she undoubtedly expressed the sentiments of many people who were never able to establish the emotional connection they would have liked with their fathers.\n\n\nLikewise, it is helpful to differentiate between words that describe what we think others are doing around us, and words that describe actual feelings.\n\n\nDistinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.\n\n\nInstead of directly stating his needs, a Palestinian mukhtar (who is like a village mayor) answered, “You people are acting like a bunch of Nazis.” A statement like that is not likely to get the cooperation of a group of Israelis!\n\n\nBecause women are socialized to view the caretaking of others as their highest duty, they often learn to ignore their own needs.\n\n\nFirst stage: Emotional slavery.

Whereas the problem in Freud’s early decades was sexual repression, and the chief problem in the early thirties, when Karen Horney wrote, was disguised hostility, today it is loneliness.\n\n\nThere are two kinds of aloneness. Solitude can be a creative, joyous, full aloneness. But loneliness is a painful, dead, empty aloneness. Loneliness is being acutely aware of one’s isolation and alienation from others.\n\n\nEighty percent of the people who fail at work do so for one reason: they do not relate well to other people.\n\n\nFour roadblocks fall into this category—criticizing, name-calling, diagnosing, and praising.

Or it can be oriented in order to break off, discourage, or avoid involvement.”\n\n\nInclining one’s body toward the speaker communicates more energy and attention than does leaning back or sprawling in the chair. When a public speaker has his audience enthralled, we say, “He has them on the edge of their seats.”\n\n\nFacing the other squarely, your right shoulder to the other’s left shoulder, helps communicate your involvement. The common phrase “He gave me the cold shoulder” suggests the indifference or rejection that can be communicated by not positioning yourself to face the other person.\n\n\nMaintaining an open position with arms and legs uncrossed is another important part of the posture of involvement.\n\n\nTo listen is to move. To listen is to be moved by the talker—physically and psychologically…. The non-moving, unblinking person can reliably be estimated to be a non-listener…. When other visible moving has ceased and the eyeblink rate has fallen to less than once in six seconds, listening, for practical purposes, has stopped.\n\n\nThe ability to have good eye contact is essential for effective interpersonal communication in our society. Sometimes it cannot be used maximally because others are uncomfortable with it. Often, however, it is one of the most effective of the listening skills.\n\n\nA. G. White’s study of medical case-history interviewing discovered that 55 percent of the patients initially sat at ease when no desk separated the patient and the doctor; only 10 percent were at ease when a desk separated the patient from the doctor.\n\n\nBeatrice Glass’s car collided with another auto. As soon after the accident as possible she telephoned her husband, Charlie, and reported that she had been in an accident. “How much damage did it do to the car?” was his immediate response. When he had that information, Charlie asked, “Whose fault was it?” Then he said, “Don’t admit a thing. You phone the insurance company and I’ll call our lawyer. Just a minute and I’ll give you the number.” “Any more questions?” she asked. “No,” he replied, “that just about covers it.” “Oh, it does, does it?” she screamed. “Well, just in case you are interested, I’m in the hospital with four broken ribs!”\n\n\nOne of the primary tasks of a listener is to stay out of the other’s way so the listener can discover how the speaker views his situation.\n\n\nDoor openers typically have four elements: A description of the other persons body language. “Your face is beaming today.” “You look like you are not feeling up to par.” An invitation to talk or to continue talking. “Care to talk about it?” “Please go on.” “I’m interested in what you are saying.” Silence—giving the other person time to decide whether to talk and/or what he wants to say. Attending—eye contact and a posture of involvement that demonstrates your interest in and concern for the other person.\n\n\nThomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson sat together for hours one night in utter silence until one rose to go and said, “We’ve had a grand evening!”\n\n\nAs philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said: “The success of language in conveying information is highly overrated….”\n\n\nPerhaps that is why the French novelist Victor Hugo advised, “When a woman is speaking to you, listen to what she says with her eyes.”\n\n\nThe therapist Frieda Fromm-Reichman devised a method that helped her sense what her clients were feeling. She knew that posture and body movement were clues to her clients’ emotions. So she would sensitively try to match her clients’ posture and gestures with her own body. Fromm-Reichman focused on what she was feeling when she assumed the client’s position and her understanding of that client increased greatly.\n\n\nEmpathy is listening with your heart as well as with your head.\n\n\nThe composer Grieg set to music Ibsen’s poem “To a Waterfowl.” When Ibsen first heard the score, he gripped Grieg’s hand and whispered, “Understood! Understood!”\n\n\nWhen the listener makes several interchangeable responses and then goes beyond what the speaker communicated, the response is additive.\n\n\n*Guidelines for improved reflective listening include:\n\nDon’t fake understanding.\nDon’t tell the speaker you know how he feels.\nVary your responses.\nFocus on the feelings.\nChoose the most accurate feeling word.\nDevelop vocal empathy.\nStrive for concreteness and relevance.\nProvide nondogmatic but firm responses.\nReflect the speaker’s resources.\nReflect the feelings that are implicit in questions.\nReflect during brief interactions.\n\n\n\nI like to think of listening and assertion as the yin and yang of communication. Vital relationships involve both asserting and listening. The yang of assertion is the disclosure to another of what the speaker feels, needs, desires. The yin of listening is understanding and acceptance offered to another in times of stress or joy.\n\n\nExperts in communications skills estimate that less than 5 percent of the population can be expected to communicate assertively.\n\n\nPeople who typically behave submissively demonstrate a lack of respect for their own needs and rights.\n\n\nAnother likelihood is that when people try to hold back their emotions, they get expressed indirectly. When this happens, submissive people become masters of the put-down. In the guise of being “helpful,” they may become occupied in extensive fault finding. Or withhold sex. They can subtly and perhaps unconsciously try to ruin the good times others are having. They become saboteurs, undermining the efforts of others. They make cutting remarks. Or they may avoid others or silently terminate a relationship. These approaches are indirectly hostile, alienating, and destructive. When anger is expressed through these disguises, it adds to the interpersonal problem rather than contributing to its solution.\n\n\nEffective assertion is characterized by firmness without domination. It vigorously defends one’s own space while steadfastly refusing to violate the trespasser’s turf.\n\n\nWhen I want another person to modify a behavior that is intrusive on my space, the method I use must meet the following criteria: There is a high probability that the other will alter the troublesome behavior. That is, the method needs to be effective in protecting my space. There is a low probability that I will violate the other person’s space. There is little likelihood of diminishing the other person’s self-esteem. While I cannot control how another person will react to what I say, I can discipline myself not to use blaming, put-down, or other derogatory kinds of language. There is low risk of damaging the relationship. Of course, if a relationship is very fragile, even the most tactful assertion may be the final act that severs it. In fragile relationships, however, submission is often as dangerous to the relationship as assertion, or even more dangerous. In most healthy relationships, effective assertion strengthens the relationship over the long haul. It is normally a bonding factor between mature people. There is a low risk of diminishing motivation. There is little likelihood that defensiveness will escalate to destructive levels. An assertion message can be phrased in ways that are less likely to provoke excessive defensiveness in the other person. And defensiveness-reducing methods can be used when the other person does experience greater stress.\n\n\nAssertions are weakened by inferences because we often guess wrongly about the internal state of another—and even when we are right, the other probably won’t admit\n\n\nAssertion theory tells us that an individual’s feelings are part of his personal space. We have no right to try to control someone else’s feelings (since that is meddling in their space), but we can try to alter behaviors that intrude on our space.\n\n\nDescribe the behavior in specific rather than fuzzy terms.\n\n\nLimit yourself to behavioral descriptions. Do not draw inferences about the other person’s motives, attitudes, character, and so on.\n\n\nMake your behavior description an objective statement rather than a judgment.\n\n\n“Most marriage bonds are not broken on the rocks in a great storm; they are worn away by the endless battering of pebbles, … the tiny conflicts and seemingly petty irritations of daily life.” Judge Joseph Sabath, commenting on the 100,000 divorce cases he has heard, reflected, “Usually it isn’t the big arguments or even physical blows, but the constant hammering and chiseling in a thousand different ways that signal the lethal warrant of their union.”\n\n\nSixth, be sure to assert to the right person. People commonly confront the wrong person. This is known as a misattributed assertion. When there is trouble at work, a person may become more confrontative at home.\n\n\nThe more we express our feelings, the more we sharpen our emotional awareness.\n\n\nFor a behavioral rehearsal, select a quiet place and arrange to be uninterrupted. Write your message before you send it. Instruct the person role-playing the other’s part to respond defensively at first. Demonstrate some examples of defensiveness. For the first “dry run,” allow the other to be defensive in whatever ways she chooses. The key is for you to remember to alternate between assertion and reflective listening. Later, you may wish to tell or show your practice partner how the recipient of your message is apt to respond. If she can role-play that type of defensiveness, all the better. But it is not necessary. Instruct your practice partner not to be “harder than life.” In the practice session, you should achieve your assertive goal if you follow the assertion process.\n\n\nSecuring an appointment to converse with the the other can be very important for the success of your assertion. If you have not agreed to talk for at least ten minutes to half an hour, the other can make the defensive response of breaking the session off in the middle, saying she has other things to do right now.\n\n\nCrying is often a manipulative way to avoid confrontations and dodge any behavioral change even though the individual is trespassing on another person’s space. Unfortunately, this method can be highly effective.\n\n\nThe recipient of an assertion message is often very indirect and vague when she begins to move from a defensive posture to a problem-solving role. She may drop a hint in the midst of highly defensive remarks. If you can note it and reflect it back, you will shorten that process and decrease the stressfulness that both parties may be experiencing.\n\n\n“One of the marks of adult maturity is a balanced relationship between the emotions and rational control systems, which allows for emotional responses without permitting them to overwhelm reason.”\n\n\nAn assertion process designed to help the asserter get her needs met while responding constructively to the expected defensiveness of the other person follows these six steps: Preparation Sending the Assertion Message Being Silent Reflectively Listening to the Defensive Response Recycling the Process Focusing on the Solution\n\n\nIt is sometimes helpful to distinguish between five types of interpersonal relationships: Very nourishing relationships—these contribute greatly to my life. Mildly nourishing relationships—these make some contribution to my development and/or to my enjoyment of life. Noncontributing relationships—these neutral encounters do nothing for me. Mildly toxic relationships—these slightly diminish my selfhood and/or my enjoyment of life. Very toxic relationships—these excessively demanding, hostile, or nerve-wracking relationships are very depleting to me.\n\n\n“Punishment hardens and numbs, it sharpens the consciousness of alienation, it strengthens the power of resistance.”\n\n\nAccording to Dreikurs, rewards are no more effective than punishment. He has two primary complaints about rewards: they tend to harm the recipient’s personality, and in the long run they cease to be effective. Rewards demonstrate a lack of respect for the other person. We reward our inferiors for good deeds and favors. Rewards also signal a lack of trust—else why would we have to bribe a person for good behavior?\n\n\nReflective Listening, Then “No.” A friend of mine commonly uses this approach. She reflects both the content and feeling of the request and then states her no: “You really need me to crew for you in the sailing races. I’d love to do it but I made a prior commitment. I just can’t do it this weekend.”\n\n\nIn one noted series, the University of Wisconsin’s Dr. Harry Harlow reared several generations of monkeys and showed that those which were raised by nonfighting monkey mothers would not make love.\n\n\nPhilosopher John Dewey wrote, “Conflict is the gadfly of thought. It stirs us to observation and memory. It instigates to invention. It shocks us out of sheeplike passivity, and sets us at noting and contriving…. Conflict is a sine qua non of reflection and ingenuity.”\n\n\nHeightened tolerance and acceptance of others also tends to diminish unrealistic conflict. To some degree our levels of tolerance and acceptance are conditioned by our upbringing and possibly even by genetic factors. But each of us can become more tolerant and accepting than we now are. Greater assertiveness, increased emotional support in our lives, effective courses in communication skills, and incorporating some of the wisdom of Rational Emotive Therapy16 are some ways of increasing one’s tolerance and acceptance.\n\n\nFactors in issues control include the following: It is often preferable to begin by establishing procedures for handling disputes rather than dealing immediately with substantive issues. It is often preferable to deal with one issue at a time. It is often preferable to break issues down into smaller units rather than deal with enormous problems with many parts. It is often preferable to start with issues that you believe can be most easily resolved to the satisfaction of all parties. It is important to eventually get down to the basic issues. When there is one fight after another, George Bach says, someone should have the sense to take the needle off the broken record and demand, “Will the real problem please stand up?”\n\n\nWhen feelings run high, rational problem solving needs to be preceded by a structured exchange of the emotional aspects of the controversy.\n\n\nDon’t say, “I know how you feel.” The other person will rarely believe it. Don’t offer explanations, apologies, or make any other statements at this point. Discipline yourself to understand the opinions and suggestions or feelings of the other person—from her point of view—and then reflect those thoughts and feelings back to the other in a succinct statement.\n\n\nBecause there are three steps involved in it, some people call the conflict resolution process the one-two-three process: Treat the other person with respect. Listen until you “experience the other side” and reflect content, feelings, and meanings. Briefly state your own views, needs, and feelings.\n\n\n“If I can listen to what he can tell me, if I can understand how it seems to him, if I can see its personal meaning for him, if I can sense the emotional flavor which it has for him, then I will be releasing potent forces of change in him.”\n\n\nDuring a conflict, focus on the emotions first. One way of doing this constructively is to use the conflict resolution method: treat the other with respect; listen and restate to the other’s satisfaction; and briefly state your point of view.\n\n\nThe problem-solving approach allows for mental double-declutching. It does not require a direct switch from one point of view to another. It provides a period “in neutral” where there is an openness to facts and, therefore, a willingness to consider an alternative view.1 —William Reddin, management consultant\n\n\nPremature forgiveness can be a well-intentioned but destructive way of avoiding conflict. Premature forgiveness is an effort to patch up a relationship without working through the angry and hurt feelings and other conflicted realities of the relationship.\n\n\nHere are the six steps of the process: Define the problem in terms of needs, not solutions. Brainstorm possible solutions. Select the solution(s) that will best meet both parties’ needs and check possible consequences. Plan who will do what, where, and by when. Implement the plan. Evaluate the problem-solving process and, at a later date, how well the solution turned out.\n\n\nDon’t evaluate. Evaluation thwarts creativity. It tends to make people defensive and they are likely to keep their ideas to themselves.\n\n\n“When you fail to use your creative problem-solving talent, you strike at the quality of your own life.”\n\n\nResearchers and theorists in the behavioral sciences claim there are three key qualities that foster improved communication: genuineness, nonpossessive love, and empathy. Genuineness means being honest and open about one’s feelings, needs, and ideas. It is a stubborn refusal to let one’s real self “travel incognito.” Nonpossessive love involves accepting, respecting, and supporting another person in a nonpaternalistic and freeing way. Empathy refers to the ability to really see and hear another person and understand him from his perspective.\n\n\nThe noted nineteenth-century political cartoonist Thomas Nast once attended a party with a group of friends. Someone asked him to draw a caricature of everyone present. This he did with a few skilled strokes of his pencil. The sketches were passed around for the guests to identify. Everyone recognized the other persons, but hardly anyone recognized the caricature of himself.\n\n\nReal love is not intrusive. It does not violate the privacy of others. It does not try to force its way into the inner sanctum of another’s personality.\n\n\nGenuine love fosters great potency in the other. It diminishes his dependency. It does not conspire with his weakness, but calls forth the other’s strength. Love holds back from “helping” another when that “help” is likely to diminish the other’s responsibility for his own life.\n\n\nTwo frequent problems with ineffective training are the educational design and the inability of the trainer to utilize the skills or express the key qualities while teaching the course.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Peopleware":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Peopleware","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Peopleware.md","title":"Peopleware","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","work","software","teams","product-management","leadership"],"content":"Peopleware\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book addresses the elephant in the software room, that people, not tech, are the obstacle. Tech is just there to be applied; solving the problem requires a lot of people and knowledge to go the right way.

Gaining some insights is more than sufficient, and I think this book is an absolute must for people who are struggling to understand how to link software and people.\nMoreover, this book is a refreshing take on teams, what makes teams great, and how you can enable teams to grow and outperform their expectations.\nOne thing that is addressed a lot is quiet time, when you work uninterrupted. This is something that is problematic and needs to be addressed.\nIt is also intersting to understand that taking time to work on hard problems is important, and not drown in the soft problems.\nI really liked - Gilb’s Law: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWe observe that about 15 percent of all projects studied came to naught: They were canceled aborted or “postponed” or they delivered products that were never used.\n\n\nFor bigger projects, the odds are even worse. Fully 25 percent of projects that lasted 25 work-years or more failed to complete\n\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of the bankrupt projects we studied, there was not a single technological issue to explain the failure.\n\n\nSpeaking to a group of software managers, we introduced a strategy for what we think of as iterative design. The idea is that some designs are intrinsically defect-prone; they ought to be rejected, not repaired. Such dead ends should be expected in the design activity. The lost effort of the dead end is a small price to pay for a clean, fresh start.\n\n\nThe Spanish Theory, for one, held that only a fixed amount of value existed on earth, and therefore the path to the accumulation of wealth was to learn to extract it more efficiently from the soil or from people’s backs.\n\n\nThen there was the English Theory that held that value could be created through ingenuity and technology. So the English had an Industrial Revolution, while the Spanish spun their wheels trying to exploit the land and the Indians in the New World.\n\n\nThe trade-off between price and quality does not exist in Japan. Rather, the idea that high quality brings on cost reduction is widely accepted.\n\n\n“When the schedule for a project is totally unreasonable and unrealistic, and no amount of overtime can allow it to be made, the project team becomes angry and frustrated … and morale drops to the bottom.”\n\n\nOrganizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day.\n\n\n*The Seven False Hopes of Software Management\n\nThere is some new trick you’ve missed that could send productivity soaring. Response: You are simply not dumb enough to have missed something so fundamental. You are continually investigating new approaches and trying out the ones that make the most sense. None of the measures you’ve taken or are likely to take can actually make productivity soar. What they do, though, is to keep everybody healthy: People like to keep their minds engaged, to learn, and to improve. The line that there is some magical innovation out there that you’ve missed is a pure fear tactic, employed by those with a vested interest in selling it.\nOther managers are getting gains of 100 percent or 200 percent or more! Response: Forget it. The typical magical tool that’s touted to you is focused on the coding and testing part of the life cycle. But even if coding and testing went away entirely, you couldn’t expect a gain of 100 percent. There is still all the analysis, negotiation, specification, training, acceptance testing, conversion, and cutover to be done.\nTechnology is moving so swiftly that you’re being passed by. Response: Yes, technology is moving swiftly, but (the High-Tech Illusion again) most of what you’re doing is not truly high-tech work. While the machines have changed enormously, the business of software development has been rather static. We still spend most of our time working on requirements and specification, the low-tech part of our work. Productivity within the software industry has improved by 3 to 5 percent a year, only marginally better than the steel or automobile industry.*\nChanging languages will give you huge gains. Response: Languages are important because they affect the way you think about a problem, but again, they can have impact only on the implementation part of the project. Because of their exaggerated claims, some of our newer languages qualify as laetrile. Sure, it may be better to implement a new feature in Java, for example, rather than PHP, but even before Java came along, there were better ways to do whatever you needed to do: niche tools that made certain classes of function pretty easy to implement. Unless you’ve been asleep at the switch for the past few decades, change of a language won’t do much for you. It might give you a 5-percent gain (nothing to sneeze at), but not more.\nBecause of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately. Response: The much talked about software backlog is a myth. We all know that projects cost a lot more at the end than what we expected them to cost at the beginning. So the cost of a system that didn’t get built this year (because we didn’t have the capacity for it) is optimistically assumed to be half of what it would actually cost to build, or even less. The typical project that’s stuck in the mythical backlog is there because it has barely enough benefit to justify building it, even with the most optimistic cost assumptions. If we knew its real cost, we’d see that project for what it is: an economic loser. It shouldn’t be in the backlog, it should be in the reject pile.\nYou automate everything else; isn’t it about time you automated away your software development staff? Response: This is another variation of the High-Tech Illusion: the belief that software developers do easily automatable work. Their principal work is human communication to organize the users’ expressions of needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle. And it’s not likely to be automated.\nYour people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure. Response: They won’t—they’ll just enjoy it less.\n\n\n\nThe manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.\n\n\nThree rules of thumb seem to apply whenever you measure variations in performance over a sample of individuals.\n• Count on the best people outperforming the worst by about 10:1.\n• Count on the best performer being about 2.5 times better than the median performer.\n• Count on the half that are better-than-median performers outdoing the other half by more than 2:1.\n\n\nWhile this [10 to 1] productivity differential among programmers is understandable, there is also a 10 to 1 difference in productivity among software organizations.\n\n\nThen, without warning, open-plan seating was upon us like a plague upon the land. The advocates of the new format produced not one shred of evidence that effectiveness would not be impaired. They really couldn’t. Meaningful measurement of productivity is a complex and elusive thing.\n\n\nAcross the whole Coding War Games sample, 58 percent complained that their workplace was not acceptably quiet; 61 percent complained that it wasn’t sufficiently private; 54 percent reported that they had a workplace at home that was better than the workplace provided by the company.\n\n\nGilb’s Law: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.\n\n\nFactor = Uninterrupted Hours/Body-Present Hours\n\n\nE-Factor = Uninterrupted Hours/Body-Present Hours\n\n\nMany of the everyday tasks performed by professional workers are done in the serial processing center of the left brain. Music will not interfere particularly with this work, since it’s the brain’s holistic right side that digests music.\n\n\nThe creativity penalty exacted by the environment is insidious. Since creativity is a sometime thing anyway, we often don’t notice when there is less of it.\n\n\nThe term unprofessional is often used to characterize surprising and threatening behavior. Anything that upsets the weak manager is almost by definition unprofessional.\n\n\nEntropy is levelness or sameness. The more it increases, the less potential there is to generate energy or do work.\n\n\nEntropy is always increasing in the organization. That’s why most elderly institutions are tighter and a lot less fun than sprightly young companies.\n\n\nAptitude tests are almost always oriented toward the tasks the person will perform immediately after being hired.\n\n\nThe aptitude tests we’ve seen are mostly left-brain oriented. That’s because the typical things new hires do are performed largely in the left brain. The things they do later on in their career, however, are to a much greater degree right-brain activities. Management, in particular, requires holistic thinking, heuristic judgment, and intuition based upon experience.\n\n\nBut from the corporate perspective, late promotion is a sign of health. In companies with low turnover, promotion into the first-level management position comes only after as much as ten years with the company. (This has long been true of some of the strongest organizations within IBM, for example.) The people at the lowest level have on the average at least five years’ experience. The hierarchy is low and flat.\n\n\nOne of our clients, a builder of network protocol analyzers and packet sniffers, estimates that it takes more than two years to bring a new worker up to speed.\n\n\nThe purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment.\n\n\nThere is a sense of eliteness on a good team. Team members feel they’re part of something unique. They feel they’re better than the run of the mill.\n\n\nOur short list of teamicide techniques is:\n\nDefensive management\nBureaucracy • Physical separation\nFragmentation of people’s time\nQuality reduction of the product\nPhony deadlines\nClique control\nSome of these techniques will look awfully familiar. They are things that companies do all the time.\n\n\n\nPaper pushers just can’t get themselves into SWAT Team mode. They can’t see themselves hell-bent for success.\n\n\nParticipant at one of our seminars made this observation: “The only time our management shows any awareness of teams is when it takes specific steps to break them up.”\n\n\nThe team phenomenon, as we’ve described it, is something that happens only at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n\n\nMost organizations don’t set out consciously to kill teams. They just act that way.\n\n\nRemove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship.\n\n\nWhen people talk about an organization that you’d have to be “sick” to work for, they’re not referring to physiological sickness. They mean that working in such a place would require them to disregard certain mental survival rules, rules that protect the well-being of the psychological self. The most important of these rules has to do with self-regard. A job situation that hurts your self-regard is itself “sick.”\n\n\nSkunkworks implies that the project is hidden away someplace where it can be done without upper management’s knowing what’s going on.\n\n\nThe amusing thing is that skunkworks is really just another word for insubordination. Management says no, and the project goes on anyway.\n\n\nPeople look out for their Open Kimono managers. They’re determined to make them look good, even though the managers may botch an occasional decision. Defensive managers are on their own.\n\n\nFor all the deference paid to the concept of leadership (a cult word in our industry), it just doesn’t have much place here.\n\n\nIn Australia, where striking uses up nearly as much labor time as working, there is a charming form of strike called work to rule. Rather than walk off the job, workers open up a fat book of procedures and announce, “Until you give us what we’re asking for, we’re going to work exactly to the rule.”\n\n\nBut how about the risk that you and your own team won’t meet your portion of the assigned goals? Of course, you worry about that; you may wake up at night in a sweat over it.\n\n\nThe ultimate management sin is wasting people’s time. It sounds like this should be an easy sin to avoid, but it isn’t.\n\n\nHow common is it that projects are overstaffed early for such political reasons? Oh, not very. Probably no more than 90 percent of all projects suffer from early overstaffing.\n\n\nPrincipal, The Atlantic Systems Guild\n\n\nAnd it should be considered that nothing is more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage, than to put oneself at the head of introducing new orders. For the introducer has all those who benefit from the old orders as enemies, and he has lukewarm defenders in all those who might benefit from the new orders. —Niccolò Machiavelli\n\n\nLearning is limited by an organization’s ability to keep its people.\n\n\nWhat chaos is left in modern society is a precious commodity\n\n\nAlso on the plus side of the ledger is the Hawthorne Effect, the boost in energy and interest that infuses your people when they’re doing something new and different.\n\n\nThe mark of the best manager is an ability to single out the few key spirits who have the proper mix of perspective and maturity and then turn them loose.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Pragmatics-of-Human-Communication":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Pragmatics-of-Human-Communication","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Pragmatics of Human Communication.md","title":"Pragmatics of Human Communication","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","speaking","communication","business-communications","relationships"],"content":"Pragmatics of Human Communication\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about communication between humans, moreso than communications between entities/institutions and humans.

Thus, to take one of his examples, when I open the refrigerator and the cat comes, rubs against my legs, and mews, this does not mean “I want milk”—as a human being would express it—but invokes a specific relationship, “Be mother to me,” because such behavior is only observed in kittens in relation to adult cats, and never between two grown-up animals.\n\n\nTo talk about relationship requires adequate translation from the analogic into the digital mode of communication. Finally we can imagine similar problems when the two modes must coexist, as Haley has noted in his excellent chapter, “Marriage Therapy”:\n\n\nWhen a man and a woman decide their association should be legalized with a marriage ceremony, they pose themselves a problem which will continue through the marriage: now that they are married are they staying together because they wish to or because they must?\n\n\nHuman beings communicate both digitally and analogically.

Most swordsmen make too much of technique, sometimes making it their chief concern.”\n\n\nPowerPoint 1.0 was created in Silicon Valley in 1987 by Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin as a way to display presentations on a Mac. It was cool. And it worked. They sold the application later that year to Microsoft.\n\n\nAccording to John Sweller, who developed the cognitive load theory in the 1980s, it is more difficult to process information if it is coming at us both verbally and in written form at the same time.\n\n\nSince people cannot read and listen well at the same time, displays filled with lots of text must be avoided. On the other hand, multimedia that displays visual information, including visualizations of quantitative information, can be processed while listening to someone speak about the visual content.\n\n\nThe key principles of Presentation Zen are: Restraint in preparation. Simplicity in design. Naturalness in delivery. These principles can be applied to both technical and nontechnical presentations\n\n\nIf You Want to Write by Brenda Ueland (Graywolf Press) is one of the most inspiring and useful books I have ever read.\n\n\nPecha Kucha is a global presentation phenomenon started in 2003 by Tokyo-based expatriate architects Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein.

And why does it matter?\n\n\nPeter Drucker said it best: “The computer is a moron.” You and your ideas (and your audience) are all that matter. So\n\n\nSecond, after you have prepared your presentation, go back and edit like crazy, eliminating parts that are not absolutely crucial to your overall point or purpose. You must be ruthless. When in doubt, cut it out.\n\n\nA presentation is never just about the facts.\n\n\nOur lives are frittered away by detail; simplify, simplify. —Henry David Thoreau\n\n\nA key tenet of the Zen aesthetic is kanso or simplicity. In the kanso concept, beauty and visual elegance are achieved by elimination and omission.\n\n\nMcCloud says cartooning is a form of amplification through simplification because the abstract images in comics are not so much the elimination of detail as they are an effort to focus on specific details.\n\n\nThese four principles—contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity—are not all there is to know about graphic design. But, understanding these simple, related concepts and applying them to slide design can make for far more satisfying and effective designs.\n\n\nDesign matters. But design is not about decoration or ornamentation. Design is about making communication as easy and clear for the viewer as possible.\n\n\nKeep the principle of signal-to-noise ratio in mind to remove all nonessential elements.\n\n\nPeople remember visuals better than bullet points.

The Pan American smile is the fake smile that involves voluntary movement around the mouth only.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/5-Love-Languages":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/5-Love-Languages","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Relationships/5 Love Languages.md","title":"5 Love Languages","links":[],"tags":["book-review","books","non-fiction","relationships"],"content":"5 Love Languages\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThe book defines 5 different ways we need affection from our loved ones. It covers how you can identify which love language your significant other uses and how to strengthen love by talking to them in their language. It does this by using examples of love languages or dialects and shows how others have used them to a great extent.\nThe Five Love Languages\n\n**Words of Affirmation\nQuality Time\nReceiving Gifts\nActs of Service\nPhysical Touch\n\n🎨 Impressions\nI think it was a good book; it gave, in a complicated way, the idea that you need to earn your love from another person by giving her or him the love they needs. It is a good and, I think, true concept. Furthermore, classifying the different love languages makes it easier to understand what the different persons require. Some might be more interested in intimacy and physical presence, while others are more into getting words of affirmation or getting acts of service.\nHow I Discovered It\nI think it was a hacker news board once again.\nWho Should Read It?\nI think if you are interested in having a long and loving relationship, there is no reason not to read this book.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI don’t think the book necessarily changed me that much; more that the concept made sense to me, and I was better able to understand what I needed more than having a profound or lasting epiphany.\nI got somewhat changed; I reflected a lot on my relationships, what I have done, and what I should have done.\nI have become a bit more conscious about my relationship and how love languages can be used to help and enable my love to grow.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIf we are to develop an intimate relationship, we need to know each other’s desires. If we wish to love each other, we need to know what the other person wants.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the husband who says, “Haven’t had an apple pie since the baby was born. Don’t guess I’ll get any more apple pies for eighteen years,” has ceased being an adult and has reverted to adolescent behavior. Such demands do not build intimacy\n\n\n*If your spouse’s love language is Words of Affirmation: 1. To remind yourself that “Words of Affirmation” is your spouse’s primary love language, print the following on a 3x5 card and put it on a mirror or other place where you will see it daily:     \n\nWords are important!      \nWords are important!      \nWords are important!\n\n\n\n*If your spouse’s love language is Words of Affirmation:\n\nTo remind yourself that “Words of Affirmation” is your spouse’s primary love language, print the following on a 3x5 card and put it on a mirror or other place where you will see it daily:      Words are important!      Words are important!      Words are important!\nFor one week, keep a written record of all the words of affirmation you give your spouse each day. At the end of the week, sit down with your spouse and review your record.   On Monday, I said:    \n\n“You did a great job on this meal.”      \n“You really look nice in that outfit.”\n“I really appreciate your picking up the laundry.”\nOn Tuesday, I said:      etc.\nYou might be surprised how well (or how poorly) you are speaking words of affirmation.\n\n\nSet a goal to give your spouse a different compliment each day for one month. If “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” maybe a compliment a day will keep the counselor away. (You may want to record these compliments also, so you will not duplicate the statements.)\nAs you read the newspaper, magazines, and books, or watch TV or listen to radio, look for words of affirmation which people use. Observe people in conversation. Write those affirming statements in a notebook. (If they are cartoons, clip and paste them in your notebook.) Read through these periodically and select those you could use with your spouse. When you use one, note the date on which you used it. Your notebook may become your love book. Remember, words are important!\nWrite a love letter, a love paragraph, or a love sentence to your spouse, and give it quietly or with fanfare! (Chances are, when he dies, you will find your love letter tucked away in some special place.) Words are important!\nCompliment your spouse in the presence of his parents or friends. You will get double credit: Your spouse will feel loved and the parents will feel lucky to have such a great son-in-law or daughter-in-law.\nLook for your spouse’s strengths and tell her how much you appreciate those strengths. Chances are she will work hard to live up to her reputation.\nTell your children how great their mother or father is. Do this behind your spouse’s back and in her presence.\nWrite a poem describing how you feel about your spouse. If you are not a poet, choose a card that expresses how you feel. Underline special words and add a few of your own at the end.\nIf you find speaking “Words of Affirmation” is difficult for you, practice in front of a mirror. Use a cue card if you must, and remember, words are important.\n\n\n\nBy “quality time,” I mean giving someone your undivided attention. I don’t mean sitting on the couch watching television together. When you spend time that way, ABC or NBC has your attention—not your spouse. What I mean is sitting on the couch with the TV off, looking at each other and talking, giving each other your undivided attention.\n\n\nWhen I sit on the couch with my wife and give her twenty minutes of my undivided attention and she does the same for me, we are giving each other twenty minutes of life. We will never have those twenty minutes again; we are giving our lives to each other. It is a powerful emotional communicator of love.\n\n\nMany of us…are trained to analyze problems and create solutions. We forget that marriage is a relationship, not a project to be completed or a problem to solve.\n\nMaintain eye contact when your spouse is talking. That keeps your mind from wandering and communicates that he/she has your full attention.\nDon’t listen to your spouse and do something else at the same time. Remember, quality time is giving someone your undivided attention. If you are watching, reading, or doing something else in which you are keenly interested and cannot turn from immediately, tell your spouse the truth. A positive approach might be, “I know you are trying to talk to me and I’m interested, but I want to give you my full attention. I can’t do that right now, but if you will give me ten minutes to finish this, I’ll sit down and listen to you.” Most spouses will respect such a request.\nListen for feelings. Ask yourself, “What emotion is my spouse experiencing?” When you think you have the answer, confirm it. For example, “It sounds to me like you are feeling disappointed because I forgot .” That gives him the chance to clarify his feelings. It also communicates that you are listening intently to what he is saying.\nObserve body language. Clenched fists, trembling hands, tears, furrowed brows, and eye movement may give you clues as to what the other is feeling. Sometimes body language speaks one message while words speak another. Ask for clarification to make sure you know what she is really thinking and feeling.\nRefuse to interrupt. Recent research has indicated that the average individual listens for only seventeen seconds before interrupting and interjecting his own ideas. If I give you my undivided attention while you are talking, I will refrain from defending myself or hurling accusations at you or dogmatically stating my position. My goal is to discover your thoughts and feelings. My objective is not to defend myself or to set you straight. It is to understand you.\n\n\n\nIf receiving gifts is my primary love language, I will place great value on the ring you have given me and I will wear it with great pride. I will also be greatly moved emotionally by other gifts that you give through the years. I will see them as expressions of love. Without gifts as visual symbols, I may question your love.\n\n\nPhysical presence in the time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if your spouse’s primary love language is receiving gifts.\n\n\n*If Your spouse’s love language is Receiving Gifts:\n\nTry a parade of gifts: Leave a box of candy for your spouse in the morning (yogurt candy if health is an issue); have flowers delivered in the afternoon (unless your spouse is allergic to flowers); give him a shirt in the evening. When your spouse asks, “What is going on?” you respond: “Just trying to fill your love tank!”\nLet nature be your guide: The next time you take a walk through the neighborhood, keep your eyes open for a gift for your spouse. It may be a stone, a stick, or a flower (be sure to ask your neighbor, if the flower is not in your own yard). You may even attach special meaning to your natural gift. For example, a smooth stone may symbolize your marriage with many of the rough places now polished. A rose may remind you of the beauty you see in your spouse.\nDiscover the value of “handmade originals.” Make a gift for your spouse. This may require you to enroll in an art or crafts class: ceramics, silversmithing, painting, wood carving, etc. Your main purpose for enrolling is to make your spouse a gift. A handmade gift often becomes a family heirloom.\nGive your spouse a gift every day for one week. It need not be a special week, just any week. I promise you it will become “The Week That Was!” If you are really energetic, you can make it “The Month That Was!” No—your spouse will not expect you to keep this up for a lifetime.\nKeep a “Gift Idea Notebook.” Every time you hear your spouse say: “I really like that,” or “Oh, I would really like to have one of those!” write it down in your notebook. Listen carefully and you will get quite a list. This will serve as a guide when you get ready to select a gift. To prime the pump, you may look through a shopping catalog together.\n“Help! I’m confused!” If you really don’t have a clue as to how to select a gift for your spouse, ask a friend or family member who knows your wife or husband well to help you. Most people enjoy making a friend happy by getting them a gift, especially if it is with your money.\nOffer the gift of presence. Say to your spouse: “I want to offer the gift of my presence at any event or on any occasion you would like this month. You tell me when, and I will make every effort to be there.” Get ready! Be positive! Who knows, you may enjoy the symphony or the hockey game.\nGive your spouse a book and agree to read it yourself. Then offer to discuss together a chapter each week. Don’t choose a book that you want him or her to read. Choose a book on a topic in which you know your spouse has an interest: sex, football, needlework, money management, child rearing, religion, or backpacking.\nGive a lasting tribute. Give a substantial gift to your spouse’s church or favorite charity in honor of her birthday, your anniversary, or another occasion. Ask the charity to send a card informing your spouse of what you have done. The church or charity will be excited and so will your spouse.\nGive a living gift. Purchase and plant a tree or flowering shrub in honor of your spouse. You may plant it in your own yard, where you can water and nurture it, or in a public park or forest where others can also enjoy it. You will get credit for this one year after year. If it is an apple tree, you may live long enough to get an apple. One warning: Don’t plant a crab apple tree!\n\n\n\nOnly one thing is certain about our behavior: It will not be the same behavior we exhibited when we were caught up in being “in love.”\n\n\nLove is a choice and cannot be coerced.\n\n\nDue to the sociological changes of the past thirty years, there is no longer a common stereotype of the male and female role in American society.\n\n\n*If your spouse’s love language is Acts of Service:\n\nMake a list of all the requests your spouse has made of you over the past few weeks. Select one of these each week and do it as an expression of love.\nCut out some heart-shaped note cards and print the following: “Today I will show my love for you by…” Complete the sentence with one of the following: mowing the lawn, vacuuming the floor, washing dishes, taking the dog for a walk, cleaning the fish bowl, etc. Give your spouse a love note accompanied by the act of service every three days for a month.\nAsk your spouse to make a list of ten things he or she would like for you to do during the next month. Then ask your spouse to prioritize those by numbering them 1–10, with 1 being the most important and 10 being least important. Use this list to plan your strategy for a month of love. (Get ready to live with a happy spouse.)\nWhile your spouse is away, get the children to help you with some act of service for him. When he walks in the door, join the children in shouting “Surprise! We love you!” Then share your act of service.\nWhat one act of service has your spouse nagged about consistently? Why not decide to see the nag as a tag? Your spouse is tagging this as really important to him or her. If you choose to do it as an expression of love, it is worth more than a thousand roses.\nIf your spouse’s requests for acts of service come across as nags or put-downs, try writing them in words that would be less offensive to you. Share this revised wording with your spouse. For example, “Honey, I love you so much. You are a hardworking man and I really appreciate you. I’d love to thank you in advance for mowing the lawn this week before Thursday when Mary and Bob come over for dinner.”\n\n\n\n*If your spouse’s love language is Acts of Service:\n\nMake a list of all the requests your spouse has made of you over the past few weeks.

I’d love to thank you in advance for mowing the lawn this week before Thursday when Mary and Bob come over for dinner.” Your husband might even respond: “Where is the lawn mower, I can’t wait!” Try it and see.\nDo some major acts of service like washing the car, cooking a meal, painting a bedroom, or washing the deck, and then post a sign that reads, “To (spouse’s name) with love,” and sign your name.\nIf you have more money than time, hire someone to do the acts of service that you know your spouse would like for you to do, such as the lawn, the housecleaning, the car washing, the laundry. If you take the responsibility for getting it done, you will be speaking love even when you are away.\nAsk your spouse to tell you the daily acts of service that would really speak love to him or her. These might include such things as putting your dirty clothes in the hamper, getting the hairs out of the sink, hanging up your clothes at night, closing the door when you go outside, preparing a meal, and washing the dishes. Seek to work these into your daily schedule. “Little things” really do mean a lot.\nPeriodically ask your spouse, “If I could do one special act of service this week, what would you request?” If possible, do it and watch your spouse’s love tank fill up!\n\n\n\nThe old-timers used to say, “The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” Many a man has been “fattened for the kill” by women who have believed this philosophy.\n\n\nPhysical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communicate hate or love.\n\n\nIf your spouse’s primary love language is physical touch, nothing is more important than holding her as she cries.\n\n\n*If your spouse’s love language is Physical Touch:\n\nAs you walk from the car to the shopping mall, reach out and hold your spouse’s hand. (Unless, of course, you have three preschool children with you.)\nWhile eating together, let your knee or foot drift over and touch your spouse. Be careful you are not rubbing the dog.\nWalk up to your spouse and say, “Have I told you lately that I love you?” Take her in your arms and hug her while you rub her back and continue. “You are the greatest!” (Resist the temptation to rush to the bedroom.) Untangle yourself and move on to the next thing.\nWhile your spouse is seated, walk up behind her and initiate a shoulder massage. Continue for five minutes unless your spouse begs you to stop.\nIf you sit together in church, when the minister calls for prayer reach over and hold your spouse’s hand.\nInitiate sex by giving your spouse a foot massage. Continue to other parts of the body as long as it brings pleasure to your spouse.\nRun the water in the Jacuzzi and announce to your spouse that you are looking for a partner to join you.\nRiding down the road together, reach over and touch your spouse on the leg, stomach, arm, hand, or…If he or she says “stop!” by all means put on the brakes.\nWhen family or friends are visiting, touch your spouse in their presence. A hug, running your hand along his or her arm, putting your arm around his as you stand talking, or simply placing your hand on her shoulder can earn double emotional points. It says, “Even with all these people in our house, I still see you.”\nWhen your spouse arrives at home, meet him or her one step earlier than usual and give your mate a big hug. If you normally meet at the door, go to the garage. If you normally meet in the garage, go to the street. Then, as the car turns into the driveway, stop your mate, lean into the lowered window, and give him or her a kiss. If you normally meet at the street, hide in the parking area and step out as your mate opens the door and give him or her a hug. (Be sure your mate sees you before you hug him or her.)\n\n\n\n*Having heard the five emotional love languages,\n\n**Words of Affirmation\nQuality Time\nReceiving Gifts\nActs of Service\nPhysical Touch\n\n\n\nMost sexual problems in marriage have little to do with physical technique but everything to do with meeting emotional needs.\n\n\nSpend some time writing down what you think is your primary love language. Then list the other four in order of importance.\n\n\ndisequilibrium of the “in love experience.” That is, almost never do two people fall in love on the same day, and almost never do they fall out of love on the same day.\n\n\nWhen the tank is low…we have no love feelings toward our spouse but simply experience emptiness and pain.\n\n\nIf you claim to have feelings that you do not have, that is hypocritical…. But if you express an act of love that is designed for the other person’s benefit or pleasure, it is simply a choice.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Crucial-Conversations-Tools-for-Talking-When-Stakes-are-High":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Crucial-Conversations-Tools-for-Talking-When-Stakes-are-High","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High.md","title":"Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High","links":[],"tags":["non-fiction","self-improvement","communication"],"content":"Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about identifying and navigating crucial moments in communication and getting to the desired end state.

You can predict with nearly 90 percent accuracy which projects will fail—months or years in advance.\n\n\nWhen sharing a story, strike a blend between confidence and humility. Share in a way that expresses appropriate confidence in your conclusions while demonstrating that, if called for, you want your conclusions challenged. To do so, change “The fact is̵ to “In my opinion.” Swap “Everyone knows that” for “I’ve talked to three of our suppliers who think that.” Soften “It’s clear to me” to “I’m beginning to wonder if.”\n\n\nIn fact, this is the first principle of dialogue—Start with Heart. That is, your own heart. If you can’t get yourself right, you’ll have a hard time getting dialogue right. When conversations become crucial, you’ll resort to the forms of communication that you’ve grown up with—debate, silent treatment, manipulation, and so on.\n\n\nPeople who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it’s true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell—after all, we do make them up of our own accord—once they’re told, the stories control us.

How do you encourage the flow of meaning in the face of differing opinions and strong emotions? Given the average person’s track record, it can’t be all that easy. In fact, given that most people’s style is based on longstanding habits, it’ll probably require a lot of effort. The truth is, people can change. In fact, we’ve trained these skills to millions around the world and have seen dramatic improvements in results and relationships. But it requires work. You can’t simply drink a magic potion and walk away changed. Instead, you’ll need to take a long, hard look at yourself. In\n\n\nAnd that’s the first problem we face in our crucial conversations. Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It’s that our motives do—a fact that we usually miss. So the first step to achieving the results we really want is to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails us. It’s our dogmatic conviction that “if we could just fix those losers, all would go better” that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress\n\n\nhave known a thousand scamps; but I never met one who considered himself so.

When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why.

Confidence does not equate to arrogance or pigheadedness. Skilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don’t have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.\n\n\nBe careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don’t hear more than you intend.\n\n\nWe mentioned that the key to sharing sensitive ideas is a blend of confidence and humility. We express our confidence by sharing our facts and stories clearly. We demonstrate our humility by then asking others to share their views—and meaning it.\n\n\nTalking tentatively simply means that we tell our story as a story rather than disguising it as a hard fact.\n\n\nWhy soften the message? Because we’re trying to add meaning to the pool, not force it down other people’s throats. If we’re too forceful, the information won’t make it into the pool. One of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become.\n\n\nFirst, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you—perhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics—or perhaps they retreat into silence.\n\n\nOne of the best ways to persuade others is with your ears—by listening to them. —DEAN RUSK\n\n\nThere are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus. These four options represent increasing degrees of involvement.\n\n\nConsulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice. You can consult with experts, a representative population, or even everyone who wants to offer an opinion.\n\n\nIf you don’t make an actual assignment to an actual person, there’s a good chance that nothing will ever come of all the work you’ve gone through to make a decision.\n\n\nLearn from Hughes. When you’re first agreeing on an assignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn’t want to take the time to think carefully about the “deliverables” and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren’t met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one?\n\n\nI can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don’t even invite me. —DAVE BARRY\n\n\nCONCLUSION—IT’S NOT ABOUT COMMUNICATION, IT’S ABOUT RESULTS\n\n\nRather, we wanted to identify crucial moments—moments when people’s actions disproportionately affect their organizations, their relationships, and their lives. Our research led us time and again to focus on moments when people need to step up to emotionally and politically risky conversations. That’s why we came to call these moments crucial conversations.\n\n\nOur emotions are incredibly plastic. In crucial moments they are almost always wrong. With practice, we can gain incredible power to change them. And as we change them, not only do we learn to change how we see those around us, but we learn to change our very lives as well.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Millennial-Love":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Millennial-Love","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Relationships/Millennial Love.md","title":"Millennial Love","links":[],"tags":["books","non-fiction","love","dating","sexuality"],"content":"Millennial Love\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a gathering of all things related to the art of modern dating.

It is a deeply personal tale, with examples and anecdotes that underlines the cold hard numbers.\n🎨 Impressions\nI had a nonchalantly good impression of it, when she told stories she had heard and her own experiences, the message resonated more loudly than when she tried to become to political.

I also can’t speak French, which was unhelpful. All of which led to me sobbing into a bowl of cold ravioli in the worst Italian restaurant in Paris.\n\n\nSometimes I want to be the kind of woman who dances through life and needs no one.

If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.’\n\n\nThis brings me to a specific form of sliding into someone’s DMs known as ‘Tindstagramming’, a harmful dating trend that was first reported about in 2017. This is how it works: someone who you’ve rejected on a dating app finds you on Instagram and slides into your DMs to give it another shot. Tindstagramming became easier in 2015, when Tinder allowed users to link their Instagram accounts to the app.\n\n\nIn 2015, Tara Marshall, a British psychologist at Brunel University, found that as many as one-third of people stalk an ex-partner on social media at least once a week.\n\n\nRoughly one in three people have used either dating apps or websites – this figure increases to almost half among 18- to 29-year-olds.[] More than 340 million people have downloaded Tinder since its launch.

But it is an honest book, that says that you should start with yourself and become a person people likes and you are comfortable with. Real men are vulnerable and in charge of their feelings.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a good book to read, in the sense that it is a book about dating that is aligned with my values and how I would like to live my life. It was mostly nice to read about the same values I want to embrace. I did not like the sexual parts that much, as they were a bit conflicting with my values. Asking for permission to do sex is considered to be a bit of a turn-off, but for me, it is important that this is clear and understandable for everyone.\nHow I Discovered It\nOn Nikitas’s Everything I Know wiki page about relationships.

I felt like it was a good companion when it came to being vulnerable and not caring too much about rejection. I think the moments I have felt hurt have been because I was vulnerable and set myself up to be disappointed.\nAlso, I think that it should not be a bad thing to approach women outside apps and stuff.

It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It’s a reflection of your neediness. Non-needy people don’t date needy people and vice-versa. They can’t because there’s no attraction to begin with.\n\n\nThe biggest aphrodisiac in the world is someone who likes you, genuinely likes you. A woman’s desire is to be desired.\n\n\nNarcissism means you only respect yourself. Neediness means you only respect others.\n\n\nRejection exists for a reason — it’s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.\n\n\nHere are some other common examples of reciprocation: - She ignores her friends to stay and talk to you. - She keeps very strong eye contact and laughs a little too much at everything you say. - When you touch her, she touches you in return. - When you put your arm around her, she leans into you. - When you take her hand to move somewhere, she holds it in return. - When you ask her out on a date, she offers a place to go or mentions something she’d like to do with you.\n\n\nstrongly believe in the idea of “Fuck Yes or No.” That is, I want women to say “Fuck Yes,” once they’ve gotten to know me. And if they aren’t enthusiastic and excited about being with me, then I’m not interested in them anymore.\n\n\nTrying to sabotage a woman’s relationship so you can swoop in and “steal” her is not only ineffectual but morally fucked up. It’s neediness and narcissism to an extreme degree.\n\n\nThe amazing thing about polarization is that the simple act of doing it demonstrates non-neediness and will then inspire more Neutral women to become Receptive than other strategies or tactics.\n\n\nEverything that is attractive is polarizing.\n\n\nBusiness guru Dan Kennedy once said, “Your ability to deal with the failure will determine how much you get to deal with success.”\n\n\nThe Three Fundamentals are: 1.

It asks if society as a whole, with liberalised sex, has been a disadvantage to society.\n🎨 Impressions\nI thought it was an interesting book in the sense that it asks if not being a sex-liberal society has been a disadvantage to girls. I think this might be true. Maybe the best way we have a truly better society is to limit the sex available for boys. Maybe all men should have a limit on how many they can date/have sex with. Same for girls maybe, then we can develop meaningful relationships instead of just having some boys do all the sex. I think most of us would be happier with that result.\nI think it is an okay book, but only people who are very liberal feminists should read it as it is not that interesting for people who are not in that category. It was not that good either.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nMonroe reportedly told a friend that she had ‘never even received a thank-you from all those who made millions off a nude Marilyn photograph. I even had to buy a copy of the magazine to see myself in it.’\n\n\nHe supposedly once said that his best pick-up line was simply the sentence ‘Hi, my name is Hugh Hefner.’\n\n\nThe 2 percent of Western European men who report watching more than 7 hours of porn a week are not a healthy and happy group, and nor are the men whose porn use may be less time-consuming but is nevertheless personally destructive. The continuing influence of the NoFap movement is a testament to the sexual dissatisfaction that often comes with porn use.\n\n\nLiberal feminism takes this market-orientated ideology and applies it to issues specific to women. For instance, when the actress and campaigner Emma Watson was criticized in 2017 for showing her breasts on the cover of Vanity Fair, she hit back with a well-worn liberal feminist phrase: ‘Feminism is about giving women choice … It’s about freedom.’\n\n\nWestern sexual culture in the twenty-first century doesn’t properly balance these interests – instead, it promotes the interests of the Hugh Hefners of the world at the expense of the Marilyn Monroes. And the influence of liberal feminism means that too many women don’t recognize this truth, blithely accepting Hefner’s claim that all of the downsides of the new sexual culture are just a small price to pay for personal freedom’.\n\n\nSexual disenchantment is a natural consequence of the liberal privileging of freedom over all other values, because, if you want to be utterly free, you have to aim for any kind of social restrictions that limit you, particularly the belief that sex has some unique, intangible value\n\n\nS. Lewis coined the phrase ‘chronological snobbery’ to describe ‘The uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate of our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that count discredited.’\n\n\nI reject the poisonous dichotomy that insists that the past must be either all good or all bad. I don’t think that we should imitate any sexual culture of the past, but nor do I think that what we have seen over the last sixty years has been a process of relentless improvement.\n\n\n1950s home economics book offering ‘tips to look after your husband’ went viral on social media. The housewife was advised that, when her husband got home from work, she should have dinner on the table, her apron off and a ribbon in her hair, and that she should always make sure to let her husband ‘talk first’.\n\n\nBut the would-be Hugh Hefners are also hurt by the pretence, albeit in a less obvious way. Mouldering away in the Playboy mansion doesn’t kill a person, but it does corrode them. True happiness is not to be found on a soiled mattress being ridden by a woman who doesn’t even like you.\n\n\nThe famous quote from Against Our Will, in which she describes rape as ‘nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.’4 Brownmiller’s model understands rape as an expression of political, as well as physical, dominance.\n\n\nPlus there really is some truth to the claim – workplace sexual harassment, for instance, is almost never perpetrated by junior men against more senior women. Instead it follows a predictable gradient: perpetrated by those with more power against those with less.\n\n\nIf we think that rape is ‘natural behaviour’ then we must – according to Brownmiller’s view here – also think of it as, firstly, permissible and, secondly, inevitable. This first claim is a textbook example of the naturalistic fallacy: the false belief that because something is natural it must necessarily be good. But the second claim is more difficult. If rape is indeed a product of evolution, does that make it inevitable? Well, not necessarily, but it certainly does make it more difficult to eradicate,\n\n\nBrownmiller writes in Against Our Will that ‘no zoologist, as far as I know, has ever observed that animals rape in their natural habitat, the wild. This statement is wrong – egregiously wrong, in fact, because plenty of other animals commit rape, and they also behave in all of the other horrible ways in which human beings sometimes behave.\n\n\nWe are closer to harbour seals than we are to elephant seals, since our females weigh on average just 25 per cent less than our males and most of our societies are only mildly polygynous. But there is some degree of sexual dimorphism that, while it may be tempered by cultural conditions, remains evident in every human society.\n\n\nIn hand grip strength, 90 per cent of females produce less force than 95 per cent of males. In other words, almost all women are weaker than almost all men, and any feminist analysis of the power dynamic between men and women has to begin with the recognition of this fact.\n\n\njust as the United States women’s national football team in 2017 were beaten by the Dallas under-fifteen boys’ team, composed of boys who had just crossed the crucial puberty line and so had begun to develop the strength and power of adult men.\n\n\nthe central feminist question ought not to be ‘How can we all be free?’ but, rather, ‘How can we best promote the wellbeing of both men and women, given that these two groups have different sets of interests, which are sometimes in tension?’\n\n\nsuch a high proportion of rape victims are teenagers.\n\n\nFemale rape victimization and female sexual attractiveness peak at exactly the same age – the two graphs map onto each other almost perfectly. Socialization theory can’t account for this because, if ‘rape is about power, not sex’, why would rapists just happen to target the age group that also just happens to be the most sexually desirable to men?\n\n\nAnd Buss adds that, in terms of personality, rapists tend to be more impulsive, hostile, disagreeable, promiscuous, hyper-masculine, and low in empathy compared with other men.\n\n\nWhich is true, of course it is! But here’s the point: rapists don’t care what feminists have to say.\n\n\nwas only after Savile died, unpunished, in 2011 that the scale of his crimes became clear. It is now believed that, over the course of at least forty years, BBC staff turned a blind eye to the rape and sexual assault of up to 1000 girls and boys by Savile in the corporation’s changing rooms and studios.\n\n\nsuccessful apps are brightly coloured like fresh fruit and glint like fresh water.\n\n\nPorn is to sex as McDonald’s is to food. These two capitalist enterprises take our natural appetites, pluck out the most compulsive and addictive elements, strip away anything truly nutritious, and then encourage us to consume more\n\n\nMost submissives (‘subs’) are female and most dominants (‘doms’) are male. One 2013 study of participants in a BDSM online forum found that only 34 per cent of men consistently preferred the sub position, while an even smaller proportion of women – 8 per cent – identified as doms.\n\n\nAny man who can maintain an erection while beating up his partner is a man to steer well clear of, but those with an interest in masochism don’t want to hear that kind of grim truth, and those with an interest in sadism don’t want to be forced to repress their desires.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Simply-Said":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Communication/Simply-Said","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Communication/Simply Said.md","title":"Simply Said","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","presentation","communication","writing","email","business","consulting"],"content":"Simply Said\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about how to communicate simply and efficiently.

People assume you are smart. You’re graded on having impact. That means getting people to take action based on your ideas.\n\n\nIntroducing yourself from the perspective of how you add value communicates not only your contribution to the world around you, but that you view yourself as having impact, rather than just having status.\n\n\nWe just saw that as X decreases, Y increases by a factor of ten.

It’s practical. We are all at work to get something done.\n\n\nLook at one person at a time for a complete sentence. If you stay with someone for a full thought, five to seven seconds, you’ll experience a number of benefits. First, you’ll relax. Most of us aren’t afraid of speaking to one person. If you only talk to one person, regardless of how many are in the room, you’ll automatically calm yourself.\n\n\nIn general, it takes less energy to be nice to everyone than to figure out whom you have to be nice to.\n\n\nThe goal with inflection is variety.

His facial expression was so flat you would have thought he was telling me he ordered a salad for lunch.”\n\n\nWhen presenting information face-to-face, one of the keys is to smile. I mentioned this earlier when discussing tone of voice. But it’s equally important from the perspective of an overall impression.\n\n\nHe said, “Not much. But I am conscious of giving someone my attention. When someone comes into my office, I put my laptop screen down and I flip my iPhone over. Then I push them to the side so there is no barrier between me and the person I am talking to. That’s all.” This is Charlie Murphy’s differentiator. He built an extremely strong personal brand as a good listener by getting the clutter out of the way and giving all of his attention to the person sitting across from him. Little changes, huge impact.\n\n\n“Why listening skills?” they responded that a leader needs to be known as a good listener in order “to gain trust and respect.” We have all known people who aren’t good listeners. People tend to avoid them. They are viewed as being wrapped up in themselves. Think of someone at work who is known as a good listener. People seek that person’s advice and guidance because she comes across as looking at the bigger picture, as being able to see beyond herself.\n\n\nHow can I help? It’s the most basic question, and yet all too often we don’t ask it.\n\n\nListener: So what’s the toughest job you ever had? Speaker: It was back in college. I sold organs. It was mostly to older people. Listener: Wow! That sounds really interesting. How did you find your target market? Speaker: Well, they gave us lists of people to call who had expressed interest or a need. They’re pretty easy to use. Listener: (Looking a bit puzzled) I wasn’t aware that kind of list existed. Was it from some national database? Speaker: I don’t remember. There was also a lot of cold calling involved. Even though these are big purchases, a lot of people buy them around the holidays. Listener: (Looking very puzzled) It must have been very difficult to cold call someone to sell an organ. How did you do that? Speaker: (Seeming nonchalant) It was no big deal. They gave us a script. The conversation progressed a bit further, but soon I could see they were both in trouble, so I interrupted. I turned to the speaker and said, “These organs you’re talking about, they’re similar to player pianos, right?” “Yes,” he replied. “Oh!” the listener said. “I thought you were selling, like, kidneys!”\n\n\nAsk questions that can’t be answered in one word. I avoid: “How many …” “How much …” and I ask very few “When’s.”  Instead, I ask: “What was it like?” “What did you think of… ?” “How did you decide to…?” and “Then, what happened?” I listen and respond with whatever comes naturally like: “Wow.” “Really!” “That sounds (tough, exciting, terrible, challenging).” and I follow up with another question.\n\n\nRead the heading: “Acme’s Performance” Identify the type of graph: “Here we have a bar chart showing our sales performance compared to goal for last year.” Define the parameters: “Along the vertical, we have the sales in millions from 0 to 50 million.

In the most common interpretation, a data model is a visual representation of the data, in the context you are analyzing.\n\n\nAn important part of data modeling is naming, such as in the example that we have seen previously, which provides the basic layer of semantics, while another important aspect is to explain how different pieces of data are related to each other.\n\n\n*Attribute: An attribute is a property of an entity for which we want to store values, such as a car plate, a customer, or the total amount of a transaction\n\n\nRelationship: A relationship is a connection between two entities that are related to each other and captures how they are related, such as the ownership relation between a car and its owner, or the purchasing relation between a customer and a product\n\n\nNatural Key (NK): This is a key that has a business significance and uniquely identifies the instances of the entity in the given context. An NK also exists outside of the database world. It is something printed on forms or that a person might use to identify an instance of the entity in the real world.\n\n\nOne-to-one cardinality: In this case, both entities could have a reference, an FK, to the other entity, but that is usually not a good idea as you get into the chicken-egg problem, and you also risk having inconsistencies.\n\n\nOne-to-many cardinality: This is the most common cardinality and the simplest case, as the many side will have an FK toward the one side.\n\n\nMany-to-many cardinality: This is a case where model and reality cannot align. An FK in an instance on any of the two sides can only contain one reference to the other side and cannot therefore correctly contain the multiple references needed for a many-to-many relationship.\n\n\nThe fan trap problem causes the calculations done on measures joined from the one side of the one-tomany relationship to be wrong.\n\n\nA chasm trap is an unmanaged and often unintentional many-to-many relationship. Because it is unmanaged, it becomes an unintended partial Cartesian product.\n\n\nThe difference between a chasm trap and a real many-to-many relationship is that in the latter you have the mapping table that limits the Cartesian product to only those occurrences that make sense.\n\n\nIn a star schema, a fact table containing the events or records containing the measures of interest is surrounded by several dimension tables. A dimension table is a denormalized table that contains the descriptive data at the lowest level of detail that you want to access and should not contain measures (in the original Kimball definition) to avoid the fan trap issue.\n\n\nThe following figure shows a typical star schema organized around an Order fact:\n\n\nIn a star schema, a fact table containing the events or records containing the measures of interest is surrounded by several dimension tables. A dimension table is a denormalized table that contains the descriptive data at the lowest level of detail that you want to access and should not contain measures (in the original Kimball definition) to avoid the fan trap issue. A measure is a number that you want to use for calculations.\n\n\nA data mart is a collection of data, generally a small subset of all the available data, that is selected to satisfy the BI needs of a specific business area, such as a department, or use case.\n\n\nAnother limitation according to the Kimball rules is that facts are only connected to dimensions, not other facts.\n\n\nThe data mesh approach was born in some of the most tech-heavy companies to obviate a very common problem that affects most of the data engineering industry: data ownership.\n\n\nThe pain is real and widespread: the people in charge of building the enterprise-wide unified data platform have no knowledge of the source data and the business; they receive at best weak support from their colleagues that run the business applications and have little to no opportunity or ability to interact with the key people that really understand the business and how data is used and interpreted on the business side.\n\n\nThe solution in the tech-heavy companies that invented the data mesh has been to use the same approach that has worked for application software delivery. They took the microservice architecture and the DevOps way of working and applied it to the data realm creating the data mesh. The data mesh can be thought of in a simplistic way as a microservice architecture where a microservice is a data warehouse.\n\n\n*An application that allows doing something using the underlying data that you do not have but is in the system providing the product.  An example could be the verification that a customer is active or is authorized to place an order of some amount. Another could be a customer-facing application to require the estimation of their house value or a quote for the car insurance.\n\n\nAn interface that allows retrieving data with a clear semantic.  An example could be the marketing department providing recent customer actions or touchpoints, a production site making available the status of an assembly line, or the logistics department making available data about distance, fuel consumption, or CO2 produced by their trucks or associated with their deliveries.\n\n\nThe flexibility of dbt also allows having multiple dbt projects interacting through clear APIs, which are the sources for one project and the exposures for the other.\n\n\nData engineering is the discipline of taking data that is born elsewhere, generally in many disparate places, and putting it together to make more sense to business users than the individual pieces of information in the systems they came from.\n\n\nTo put it another way, data engineers do not create data; they manage and integrate existing data.\n\n\nData comes from “ datum ”, and it means “given.”\n\n\nThese ideas are exemplified by the four-eyes principle, requiring each piece of code to be seen and approved by at least two people (through pairing, pull requests, or code walkthroughs), and the boy scout rule, which prompts you to ensure a piece of code you touch is left in better shape than it was before you touched it, independently of the person that wrote it, therefore improving the work over time.\n\n\nSRP: The single-responsibility principle says that a model should have one, and only one, reason to change. In practice, this means that a model should focus on doing one thing, hopefully doing it well and making obvious what it does.\n\n\nOCP: The open/closed principle says that a model should be open for extension and closed for (interface) modification. This means that the models that we use as connecting points between systems and models should be stable in the interfaces they expose and should also be easily extensible.\n\n\nISP: The interface segregation principle says that a client should not depend upon an interface it does not use. Seems trivial, but we all have seen customer dimensions with over 100 columns. Again, it is quite simple to adhere to this principle in the data world by using a view that provides access to the underlining refined data exposing only the required information, and not everything available “just because.” In this way, we limit the “blast radius” of eventual changes that make some fields unavailable or change semantics.\n\n\nLSP: The least surprise principle says that a model should do what seems obvious it would do from its name and position in a project.\n\n\nThe seed loading mechanism in dbt is not a general-purpose way to load high amounts of data from CSV files – it is only intended as a utility tool to load small amounts of data (up to hundreds or a few thousands of lines) that are strictly connected with the current project and do not make much sense to maintain or load in a different place or with a different tool.\n\n\nIntermediate transformation (TR): This is a catch-all type for models that you create for intermediate calculations that do not represent a proper business concept or that cannot exist by themselves, in the sense that you will not expect other developers to use such a model without knowing the specific caveats.\n\n\nRefined model (REF): This is the type for models that represent a recognizable business concept, at any level, with the level needing to be clear from the name if it is not for general use. We expect that anyone needing this concept at that level should reuse this model and not build their own.\n\n\nMapping model (MAP): This is the type for models that support conversion from one reference system to another, by providing the mapping for keys in one system to the equivalent key in the other system.\n\n\nMaster Data Dimension (MDD) model: This is the type for models that implement dimensions provided directly from the master data management system.\n\n\nAggregated (AGG) model: This is the type for models that contain aggregated or summarized data.\n\n\nPivoted (PIVOT) model: This is the type for models that contain pivoted data. This is a specialized model type that you can use if you happen to deal with pivoted data. It is listed here to make clear that you can create new model types according to your needs. The goal should always be to provide clear communication of what the model does.\n\n\nApplying the You Aint Gonna Need It (YAGNI) principle, you should not introduce things (features, models, and any other complication) until they are really needed. Following this principle is essential in big projects, and for this reason, we think that adding a temporary or skeleton REF model would only be a good idea when you already have a good plan on how to develop it, you are ready to do that development in a short time frame, and splitting the model in two would ease the work of the development team.\n\n\nPre-hooks and post-hooks are dbt features that allow you to execute one or more SQL queries before or after the creation of a model, including seed tables.\n\n\nCopying and pasting code is one of the safest ways to quickly reach maintenance hell. It wastes time and is error prone and maintenance will quickly get out of scale, as every change will need to be made manually in all the places that you have copied and pasted the code, but good luck finding them all!\n\n\nRemember that in dbt Cloud, the environment variables have strict names that must start with DBT_ orDBT_ENV_SECRET_. The difference between the two is the ability of dbt Cloud to remove its printed values from logs and not show or print out the secret ones in the UI.\n\n\nDbt_profiler package This package provides macros to profile the content of your relations, providing many measures for each column, such as the proportion of not null, min, max, and the number of distinct values.\n\n\nThis dbt package builds a data mart to analyze the executions and usage of dbt components, such as models, tests, and exposures, ultimately describing the dbt project where you install the package. snowflake_spend package\n\n\nWe will use the MD5 hashing algorithm, which produces a 128-bit digest, generally represented by 16 bytes or 32 hexadecimal characters. Using MD5, the collision risk is so low that in a table with 200 billion hashes, the chance of collision is negligible (p=10-18) being 10,000 times less probable than the odds of a meteorite landing on the data center holding your data (p=10-14). In any case, we can easily test that we do not have collisions.\n\n\nTest categories from version 0.8.0 of the dbt_expectations package: table shape, missing values, unique values and types, sets and ranges, string matching, aggregate functions, and multi-column and distributional functions.\n\n\nWriting dbt tests on sources is so simple and quick that it is often the single best way to get acquainted with some new data that you do not know well enough.\n\n\nOf course, one ideal way to do such explorations is to use the dbt_profiler package, but if you do not have that installed, using tests is a quick and commonplace way to check your initial expectations and document your findings with the rest of your team.\n\n\nThe Primary Key (PK) and the Business Key (BK): Getting the PK/BK right is essential to be able to identify an entity and store their history of changes. They enable us to join facts and dimensions, and the BK is essential to be able to identify the same entity across different systems.\n\n\nBusiness rules (BRs): BRs come in many flavors and are the spice that gives most of the value to our data platform. It is impossible to make a complete list of BR types, as they can range from calculations to ways of connecting entities to ways of formatting data.\n\n\nPKs and BKs are essential, and we must do all that we can to get them right; otherwise, we will be unable to properly join data or store the history of changes, and we will likely generate duplicates.\n\n\nWith over two decades of experience working in different countries, companies, sectors, and functions, I can say that developers love their work, and they hate doing nothing or, even worse, stupid, pointless things.\n\n\nRemember that with dbt, it is easier to let all the columns to flow forward in the ELT than to remove some from the flow, and the drawback of that in a columnar database is pretty much only the cost of cheap storage, so the common scenario is that a model has all the columns from the models that it is derived from.\n\n\nFact: The fact is the table at the center of the star schema, providing the numbers that describe what has happened in the organization that is what we want to analyze.\n\n\nBase fact as the native information that an organization produces. These are often the facts that are named by the business when they make their requests, and this is what we usually get from the organization’s systems.\n\n\nEnter the composite fact. A composite fact is created by putting together information from multiple base facts, using the relations that exist naturally between the base facts.\n\n\nThe general progression of this S2 story, which generally overlaps with the final part of the S1 story, is a kind of recursive process to find where is and how to connect the required information that is not yet available to produce the desired refined models.\n\n\nS4 – an acceptance test of the data produced in the data mart\n\n\nManual acceptance test: This is still the most common case where you ask the business or colleagues from another team to verify that the data that you produced is correct.\n\n\nThe most important aspect for a team to be able to work together is alignment, which I will simply define as the ability and desire of team members to go in the same direction. It is important to reflect on both dimensions – ability and desire.\n\n\nTeam members must be able to work in the same direction; they must know and clearly understand the expected common direction (that must be the same of the management),\n\n\nThe main difference when using the build command is that it will execute and immediately test each node so that nodes that depend on a resource that fails to execute or have a failing test will not be executed.\n\n\nHooks The hook feature allows you to attach the execution of arbitrary SQL to specific moments in the life cycle of models and project runs.\n\n\non-run-end: The SQL will be run at the end of the dbt command\n\n\nHooks allow you to run arbitrary SQL, but the most common use has been to apply grants to models when they are built.\n\n\nSource definition: The source definition’s role is to reference external data in a way that’s easy and flexible to manage, adding semantics by naming groups of inputs and flexibility through a layer of indirection.\n\n\nSnapshot: The snapshot’s role is to store changes in an input entity when you receive periodic snapshots from the source. It is a core dbt component\n\n\nDIM model: The DIM model’s role is to represent a Kimball-style dimension or hierarchy.\n\n\nREPORT model: The REPORT model’s role is to represent a table that can power a report.\n\n\nMaster Data Dimensions (MDDs): This is the dimension that contains the “gold records” of the business concept. Often, there is not a full dimension but only a list of master data codes, maybe with a name or description for human use.\n\n\nMapping tables (MAPs): This is a table that allows us to convert the codes from one domain into another – for example, converting Italian product codes into EMEA codes. These mapping tables are at the heart of every MD initiative as they are the tools for making data interoperable.\n\n\nThe far superior solution, called self-completing dimension, is to keep the correct data in the facts, loading them independently of each dimension, and instead add the orphan FKs from the facts in the dimensions, completing them with a copy of a default record for each orphan FK from the facts.\n\n\nIngesting data into the platform is still one of the key aspects of building any data platform – without data, there is no data platform.\n\n\nEXTERNAL TABLE: In Snowflake, it is possible to define external tables that point to a folder in a container on an external storage service and the table will parse the files according to the provided file format and expression for the fields.\n\n\nThe organization of the fields in a file or table is called the schema of the file/table and it includes the name, type, and eventual organization (nesting) of columns. The name “schema” is overused in data, but this is the most common use.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Engineering/Fundamentals-of-Data-Engineering":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Engineering/Fundamentals-of-Data-Engineering","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Data/Data Engineering/Fundamentals of Data Engineering.md","title":"Fundamentals of Data Engineering","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","data-engineering","data-science","data-drift","programming","ETL"],"content":"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book covers the fundamentals of data engineering and how to solve problems. of data engineering without going to much into detail of the programming.

We both had the experience of being assigned to data science projects, then struggling to execute these projects due to a lack of proper foundations.\n\n\nThe big idea of this book is the data engineering lifecycle: data generation, storage, ingestion, transformation, and serving. Since the dawn of data, we’ve seen the rise and fall of innumerable specific technologies and vendor products, but the data engineering life cycle stages have remained essentially unchanged.\n\n\nWe assume that infrastructure and systems are ephemeral and scalable, and that data engineers will lean toward deploying managed services in the cloud.\n\n\nData engineering is a set of operations aimed at creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information.\n\n\nAnother famous and succinct description of big data is the three V’s of data: velocity, variety, and volume.\n\n\nOnce a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road. ​—​Stewart Brand\n\n\nThe need for production-ready data science is a significant driver behind the emergence of the data engineering profession.\n\n\nWe divide the data engineering lifecycle into the following five stages: Generation Storage Ingestion Transformation Serving data\n\n\nThe feature store is a recently developed tool that combines data engineering and ML engineering.

Some of the most interesting examples are Prefect and Dagster, which aim to improve the portability and testability of DAGs to allow engineers to move from local development to production more easily. Argo is an orchestration engine built around Kubernetes primitives; Metaflow is an open source project out of Netflix that aims to improve data science orchestration. We must point out that orchestration is strictly a batch concept. The streaming alternative to orchestrated task DAGs is the streaming DAG. Streaming DAGs remain challenging to build and maintain, but next-generation streaming platforms such as Pulsar aim to dramatically reduce the engineering and operational burden.\n\n\nDataOps maps the best practices of Agile methodology, DevOps, and statistical process control (SPC) to data.\n\n\nOne of the tenets of the DataOps Manifesto is “Embrace change.”\n\n\nAs Werner Vogels is famous for saying, “Everything breaks all the time.”\n\n\nData architecture reflects the current and future state of data systems that support an organization’s long-term data needs and strategy.\n\n\nIn the big data era, we saw a Cambrian explosion of data-processing frameworks inside the Hadoop ecosystem.\n\n\nJeff Bezos is credited with the idea of one-way and two-way doors.1 A one-way door is a decision that is almost impossible to reverse. For example, Amazon could have decided to sell AWS or shut it down. It would be nearly impossible for Amazon to rebuild a public cloud with the same market position after such an action. On the other hand, a two-way door is an easily reversible decision: you walk through and proceed if you like what you see in the room or step back through the door if you don’t.\n\n\nGood data architecture is flexible and easily maintainable.\n\n\nDesign for automation. Be smart with state. Favor managed services. Practice defense in depth. Always be architecting.\n\n\nRecovery time objective The maximum acceptable time for a service or system outage. The recovery time objective (RTO) is generally set by determining the business impact of an outage.\n\n\nPer the EABOK, an architect’s job is to develop deep knowledge of the baseline architecture (current state), develop a target architecture, and map out a sequencing plan to determine priorities and the order of architecture changes.\n\n\nWhen the architecture of the system is designed to enable teams to test, deploy, and change systems without dependencies on other teams, teams require little communication to get work done. In other words, both the architecture and the teams are loosely coupled.\n\n\nIn 2002, Bezos wrote an email to Amazon employees that became known as the Bezos API Mandate: All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. It doesn’t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols—doesn’t matter. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. The advent of Bezos’s API Mandate is widely viewed as a watershed moment for Amazon.\n\n\nWith the FinOps Foundation and O’Reilly’s Cloud FinOps. We also suggest that data engineers involve themselves in the community process of creating FinOps practices for data engineering— in such a new practice area, a good deal of territory is yet to be mapped out.\n\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about breaking apart a monolith, we suggest reading the fantastic, pragmatic guide Software Architecture: The Hard Parts by Neal Ford\n\n\nProjects roughly fall into two buckets: brownfield and greenfield. Brownfield projects Brownfield projects often involve refactoring and reorganizing an existing architecture and are constrained by the choices of the present and past. Because a key part of architecture is change management, you must figure out a way around these limitations and design a path forward to achieve your new business and technical objectives\n\n\nA popular alternative to a direct rewrite is the strangler pattern: new systems slowly and incrementally replace a legacy architecture’s components.\n\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, a greenfield project allows you to pioneer a fresh start, unconstrained by the history or legacy of a prior architecture. Greenfield projects tend to be easier than brownfield projects, and many data architects and engineers find them more fun!\n\n\nThere’s also a temptation to do resume-driven development, stacking up impressive new technologies without prioritizing the project’s ultimate goals. Always prioritize requirements over building something cool.\n\n\nA data warehouse is a central data hub used for reporting and analysis. Data in a data warehouse is typically highly formatted and structured for analytics use cases. It’s among the oldest and most well-established data architectures.\n\n\nIn 1990, Bill Inmon originated the notion of the data warehouse, which he described as “a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions.” Though technical aspects of the data warehouse have evolved significantly, we feel this original definition still holds its weight today.\n\n\nThe organizational data warehouse architecture has two main characteristics: Separates analytics processes (OLAP) from production databases (online transaction processing) This separation is critical as businesses grow. Moving data into a separate physical system directs load away from production systems and improves analytics performance. Centralizes and organizes data Traditionally, a data warehouse pulls data from application systems by using ETL. The extract phase pulls data from source systems. The transformation phase cleans and standardizes data, organizing and imposing business logic in a highly modeled form.\n\n\nGoogle BigQuery, Snowflake, and other competitors popularized the idea of separating compute from storage. In this architecture, data is housed in object storage, allowing virtually limitless storage.\n\n\nA data mart is a more refined subset of a warehouse designed to serve analytics and reporting, focused on a single suborganization, department, or line of business; every department has its own data mart, specific to its needs.\n\n\nData marts exist for two reasons. First, a data mart makes data more easily accessible to analysts and report developers. Second, data marts provide an additional stage of transformation beyond that provided by the initial ETL or ELT pipelines.\n\n\nInstead of imposing tight structural limitations on data, why not simply dump all of your data—structured and unstructured—into a central location? The data lake promised to be a democratizing force, liberating the business to drink from a fountain of limitless data. The first-generation data lake, “data lake 1.0,” made solid contributions but generally failed to deliver on its promise.\n\n\nDespite the promise and hype, data lake 1.0 had serious shortcomings. The data lake became a dumping ground; terms such as data swamp, dark data, and WORN were coined as once-promising data projects failed.\n\n\nIn particular, the data lakehouse supports atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions, a big departure from the original data lake, where you simply pour in data and never update or delete it. The term data lakehouse suggests a convergence between data lakes and data warehouses.\n\n\nAdditional Resources “Separating Utility from Value Add” by Ross Pettit “Tactics vs. Strategy: SOA and the Tarpit of Irrelevancy” by Neal Ford The Information Management Body of Knowledge website “The Modern Data Stack: Past, Present, and Future” by Tristan Handy “Potemkin Data Science” by Michael Correll “A Comparison of Data Processing Frameworks” by Ludovik Santos “Modern CI Is Too Complex and Misdirected” by Gregory Szorc “Questioning the Lambda Architecture” by Jay Kreps “End-to-End Serverless ETL Orchestration in AWS: A Guide” by Rittika Jindal “A Brief Introduction to Two Data Processing Architectures—Lambda and Kappa for Big Data” by Iman Samizadeh “How to Beat the Cap Theorem” by Nathan Marz “The Log: What Every Software Engineer Should Know About Real-Time Data’s Unifying Abstraction” by Jay Kreps “Run Your Data Team Like a Product Team” by Emilie Schario and Taylor A.\n\n\n“What’s Wrong with MLOps?” by Laszlo Sragner\n\n\nFalling Back in Love with Data Pipelines” by Sean Knapp\n\n\nThere is a continuum of simple to complex technologies, and a team’s size roughly determines the amount of bandwidth your team can dedicate to complex solutions.\n\n\nWe sometimes see small data teams read blog posts about a new cutting-edge technology at a giant tech company and then try to emulate these same extremely complex technologies and practices. We call this cargo-cult engineering, and it’s generally a big mistake\n\n\nTechnology, speed to market wins. This means choosing the right technologies that help you deliver features and data faster while maintaining high-quality standards and security.\n\n\nWe’ve discussed, typical cloud spending is inherently opex: companies pay for services to run critical data processes rather than making up-front purchases and clawing back value over time.\n\n\nThe goal of FinOps is to fully operationalize financial accountability and business value by applying the DevOps-like practices of monitoring and dynamically adjusting systems.\n\n\nGoing multicloud can introduce significant complexity. Companies must now manage a dizzying array of services across several clouds; cross-cloud integration and security present a considerable challenge; multicloud networking can be diabolically complicated.\n\n\nThe last thing you want is for your technology choice to be stuck in limbo while waiting for budget approval. As the old saying goes, time kills deals.\n\n\nOf course, the monolith has cons. For one thing, monoliths are brittle. Because of the vast number of moving parts, updates and releases take longer and tend to bake in “the kitchen sink.” If the system has a bug—hopefully, the software’s been thoroughly tested before release!—it can harm the entire system.\n\n\nAtomicity, consistency, isolation, durability). Consistency means that any database read will return the last written version of the retrieved item. Isolation entails that if two updates are in flight concurrently for the same thing, the end database state will be consistent with the sequential execution of these updates in the order they were submitted. Durability indicates that committed data will never be lost, even in the event of power loss.\n\n\nBy contrast, a stream is an append-only log of event records.\n\n\nData is stored in a table of relations (rows), and each relation contains multiple fields (columns); see Figure 5-7. Note that we use the terms column and field interchangeably throughout this book. Each relation in the table has the same schema (a sequence of columns with assigned static types such as string, integer, or float).\n\n\nGraph databases explicitly store data with a mathematical graph structure (as a set of nodes and edges).\n\n\nWebhooks are a simple event-based data-transmission pattern. The data source can be an application backend, a web page, or a mobile app. When specified events happen in the source system, this triggers a call to an HTTP endpoint hosted by the data consumer. Notice that the connection goes from the source system to the data sink, the opposite of typical APIs. For this reason, webhooks are often called reverse APIs.\n\n\nA data contract is a written agreement between the owner of a source system and the team ingesting data from that system for use in a data pipeline.\n\n\nAutomation There’s the automation impacting the source system, such as code updates and new features.\n\n\nLike Memcached, Redis is a key-value store, but it supports somewhat more complex data types (such as lists or sets) Redis also builds in multiple persistence mechanisms, including snapshotting and journaling. With a typical configuration, Redis writes data roughly every two seconds.\n\n\nHadoop is similar to object storage, but with a key difference: Hadoop combines compute and storage on the same nodes, where object stores typically have limited support for internal processing.\n\n\nThe data lake was originally conceived as a massive store where data was retained in raw, unprocessed form.\n\n\nThe data lakehouse is an architecture that combines aspects of the data warehouse and the data lake. As it is generally conceived, the lakehouse stores data in object storage just like a lake. However, the lakehouse adds to this arrangement features designed to streamline data management and create an engineering experience similar to a data warehouse.\n\n\nA data catalog is a centralized metadata store for all data across an organization. Strictly speaking, a data catalog is not a top-\n\n\nA data catalog is a centralized metadata store for all data across an organization. Strictly speaking, a data catalog is not a top-level data storage abstraction, but it integrates with various systems and abstractions. Data catalogs typically work across operational and analytics data sources, integrate data lineage and presentation of data relationships, and allow user editing of data descriptions.\n\n\nDeleting any raw files in the underlying object store. Databricks and other data lake management technologies sometimes also support a notion of deep copying, whereby all underlying data objects are copied.\n\n\nHot data Hot data has instant or frequent access requirements. The underlying storage for hot data is suited for fast access and reads, such as SSD or memory.\n\n\nWarm data is accessed semi-regularly, say, once per month. No hard and fast rules indicate how often warm data is accessed, but it’s less than hot data and more than cold data.\n\n\nOn the other extreme, cold data is infrequently accessed data. The hardware used to archive cold data is typically cheap and durable, such as HDD, tape storage, and cloud-based archival systems. Cold data is mainly meant for long-term archival, when there’s little to no intention to access the data. Though storing cold data is cheap, retrieving cold data is often expensive.\n\n\nData is an asset that (hopefully) has an ROI. On the cost side of ROI, an obvious storage expense is associated with data. Consider the timeline in which you need to retain data.\n\n\nWe can think about software engineering in the context of storage in two ways. First, the code you write should perform well with your storage system. Make sure the code you write stores the data correctly and doesn’t accidentally cause data, memory leaks, or performance issues. Second, define your storage infrastructure as code and use ephemeral compute resources when it’s time to process your data.\n\n\nData ingestion is the process of moving data from one place to another.\n\n\nWhereas data ingestion is data movement from point A to B, data integration combines data from disparate sources into a new dataset.\n\n\nA data pipeline is the combination of architecture, systems, and processes that move data through the stages of the data engineering lifecycle.\n\n\nEvents that cannot be ingested need to be rerouted and stored in a separate location called a dead-letter queue.\n\n\nODBC uses a driver hosted by a client accessing the database to translate commands issued to the standard ODBC\n\n\nThe bulk of software engineering is just plumbing. ​—​Karl Hughes\n\n\nEngineers should also be aware of the file formats to export. CSV is still ubiquitous and highly error prone at the time of this writing. Namely, CSV’s default delimiter is also one of the most familiar characters in the English language—the comma! But it gets worse.\n\n\nAccessing and sending data both from secure FTP (SFTP) and secure copy (SCP) are techniques you should be familiar with, even if data engineers do not typically use these regularly (IT or security/secOps will handle this).\n\n\nWebhooks, as we discussed in Chapter 5, are often referred to as reverse APIs. For a typical REST data API, the data provider gives engineers API specifications that they use to write their data ingestion code. The code makes requests and receives data in responses.\n\n\n*Traditional approach is a careful command-and-control review process. Working with clients at large enterprises, we have been quoted lead times of six months for the addition of a single field. This is an unacceptable impediment to agility. *\n\n\nWe often refer to data as a silent killer. If quality, valid data is the foundation of success in today’s businesses, using bad data to make decisions is much worse than having no data.\n\n\nOne of the inherent differences between DevOps and DataOps is that we expect software regressions only when we deploy changes, while data often presents regressions independently because of events outside our control.\n\n\nA common technique for improving query performance is to pre-join data. If you find that analytics queries are joining the same data repeatedly, it often makes sense to join the data in advance and have queries read from the pre-joined version\n\n\nA database commit is a change within a database, such as creating, updating, or deleting a record, table, or other database objects.\n\n\nA data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions. The data warehouse contains granular corporate data. Data in the data warehouse is able to be used for many different purposes, including sitting and waiting for future requirements which are unknown today.\n\n\nThe second salient characteristic of the data warehouse is that it is integrated. Of all the aspects of a data warehouse, integration is the most important. Data is fed from multiple, disparate sources into the data warehouse. As the data is fed, it is converted, reformatted, resequenced, summarized, etc. The result is that data—once it resides in the data warehouse —has a single physical corporate image.\n\n\nI’ve always been a fan of ETL because of the fact that ETL forces you to transform data before you put it into a form where you can work with it. But some organizations want to simply take the data, put it into a database, then do the transformation… I’ve seen too many cases where the organization says, oh we’ll just put the data in and transform it later. And guess what? Six months later, that data [has] never been touched.\n\n\nData wrangling takes messy, malformed data and turns it into useful, clean data. This is generally a batch transformation process.\n\n\nData wrangling has long been a major source of pain and job security for ETL developers. For example, suppose that developers receive EDI data from a partner business regarding transactions and invoices, potentially a mix of structured data and text.\n\n\nETL scripts are notorious for breaking the DRY principle.\n\n\nIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently. ​—​Warren Buffett\n\n\nAbove all else, trust is the root consideration in serving data; end users need to trust the data they’re receiving.\n\n\nData validation is analyzing data to ensure that it accurately represents financial information, customer interactions, and sales. Data observability provides an ongoing view of data and data processes.\n\n\nWhen engineers recognize the need to focus on value and use cases, they become much more valuable and effective in their roles.\n\n\nA good definition of a data product is a product that facilitates an end goal through the use of data. ​—​DJ Patil\n\n\nJupyter stands for Julia, Python, and R —\n\n\nData scientists are notorious for doing most development on their local machines.\n\n\nData engineers should avoid using CSV files in pipelines because they are highly error-prone and deliver poor performance.\n\n\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has emerged as the new standard for data exchange over APIs, and it has also become an extremely popular format for data storage.\n\n\nJSON Lines (JSONL) is a specialized version of JSON for storing bulk semistructured data in files.

It is about the inner workings of the spark engine and how to manipulate it.\n🎨 Impressions\nI found it interesting, and i think re-reading the quotes after working a little time on Spark and learning by doing and then revisit.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nApache Spark is currently one of the most popular systems for large-scale data processing, with APIs in multiple programming languages and a wealth of built-in and third-party libraries.\n\n\nApache Spark is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters.\n\n\nSpark’s key driving goal is to offer a unified platform for writing big data applications.\n\n\nA cluster, or group, of computers, pools the resources of many machines together, giving us the ability to use all the cumulative resources as if they were a single computer. Now, a group of machines alone is not powerful, you need a framework to coordinate work across them. Spark does just that, managing and coordinating the execution of tasks on data across a cluster of computers.\n\n\nThe DataFrame concept is not unique to Spark. R and Python both have similar concepts. However, Python/R DataFrames (with some exceptions) exist on one machine rather than multiple machines. This limits what you can do with a given DataFrame to the resources that exist on that specific machine.\n\n\nStructured APIs apply to both batch and streaming computation. This means that when you work with the Structured APIs, it should be simple to migrate from batch to streaming (or vice versa) with little to no effort.\n\n\nThe Structured APIs are the fundamental abstraction that you will use to write the majority of your data flows.\n\n\nThe Structured APIs are a tool for manipulating all sorts of data, from unstructured log files to semi-structured CSV files and highly structured Parquet files.\n\n\nDataFrames and Datasets are (distributed) table-like collections with well-defined rows and columns.\n\n\nA schema defines the column names and types of a DataFrame. You can define schemas manually or read a schema from a data source (often called schema on read). Schemas consist of types, meaning that you need a way of specifying what lies where.\n\n\nSpark uses an engine called Catalyst that maintains its own type information through the planning and processing of work.\n\n\nHere’s an overview of the steps: Write DataFrame/Dataset/SQL Code. If valid code, Spark converts this to a Logical Plan. Spark transforms this Logical Plan to a Physical Plan, checking for optimizations along the way. Spark then executes this Physical Plan (RDD manipulations) on the cluster.\n\n\nDefinitionally, a DataFrame consists of a series of records (like rows in a table), that are of type Row, and a number of columns (like columns in a spreadsheet) that represent a computation expression that can be performed on each individual record in the Dataset. Schemas define the name as well as the type of data in each column. Partitioning of the DataFrame defines the layout of the DataFrame or Dataset’s physical distribution across the cluster. The partitioning scheme defines how that is allocated. You can set this to be based on values in a certain column or nondeterministically.\n\n\nWhen working with big data, the second most common task you will do after filtering things is counting things.\n\n\nSpark takes advantage of the complete power of Java regular expressions. The Java regular expression syntax departs slightly from other programming languages, so it is worth reviewing before putting anything into production.\n\n\nAs a best practice, you should always use nulls to represent missing or empty data in your DataFrames. Spark can optimize working with null values more than it can if you use empty strings or other values.\n\n\nOne of the most powerful things that you can do in Spark is define your own functions. These user-defined functions (UDFs) make it possible for you to write your own custom transformations using Python or Scala and even use external libraries.\n\n\nSkewness and kurtosis are both measurements of extreme points in your data. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the values in your data around the mean, whereas kurtosis is a measure of the tail of data.\n\n\nSemi joins are a bit of a departure from the other joins. They do not actually include any values from the right DataFrame. They only compare values to see if the value exists in the second DataFrame. If the value does exist, those rows will be kept in the result, even if there are duplicate keys in the left DataFrame. Think of left semi joins as filters on a DataFrame, as opposed to the function of a conventional join:\n\n\nNatural joins make implicit guesses at the columns on which you would like to join. It finds matching columns and returns the results.\n\n\nThe last of our joins are cross-joins or cartesian products. Cross-joins in simplest terms are inner joins that do not specify a predicate. Cross joins will join every single row in the left DataFrame to ever single row in the right DataFrame.\n\n\nSpark approaches cluster communication in two different ways during joins. It either incurs a shuffle join, which results in an all-to-all communication or a broadcast join.\n\n\nIn a shuffle join, every node talks to every other node and they share data according to which node has a certain key or set of keys (on which you are joining). These joins are expensive because the network can become congested with traffic, especially if your data is not partitioned well.\n\n\nOne thing we did not mention but is important to consider is if you partition your data correctly prior to a join, you can end up with much more efficient execution because even if a shuffle is planned, if data from two different DataFrames is already located on the same machine, Spark can avoid the shuffle.\n\n\nThe foundation for reading data in Spark is the DataFrameReader. We access this through the SparkSession via the read attribute: spark.read After we have a DataFrame reader, we specify several values: The format The schema The read mode A series of options\n\n\nThe line-delimited versus multiline trade-off is controlled by a single option: multiLine. When you set this option to true, you can read an entire file as one json object and Spark will go through the work of parsing that into a DataFrame. Line-delimited JSON is actually a much more stable format because it allows you to append to a file with a new record (rather than having to read in an entire file and then write it out), which is what we recommend that you use. Another key reason for the popularity of line-delimited JSON is because JSON objects have structure, and JavaScript (on which JSON is based) has at least basic types.\n\n\nWe recommend writing data out to Parquet for long-term storage because reading from a Parquet file will always be more efficient than JSON or CSV. Another advantage of Parquet is that it supports complex types.\n\n\nORC is a self-describing, type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop workloads.\n\n\nYou can use the collect_list function, which creates a list of values. You can also use the function collect_set, which creates an array without duplicate values.\n\n\nJoinWith is roughly equal to a co-group (in RDD terminology) and you basically end up with two nested Datasets inside of one. Each column represents one Dataset and these can be manipulated accordingly. This can be useful when you need to maintain more information in the join or perform some more sophisticated manipulation on the entire result, like an advanced map or filter.\n\n\nYou should generally use the lower-level APIs in three situations: You need some functionality that you cannot find in the higher-level APIs; for example, if you need very tight control over physical data placement across the cluster. You need to maintain some legacy codebase written using RDDs. You need to do some custom shared variable manipulation.\n\n\nIn short, an RDD represents an immutable, partitioned collection of records that can be operated on in parallel. Unlike DataFrames though, where each record is a structured row containing fields with a known schema, in RDDs the records are just Java, Scala, or Python objects of the programmer’s choosing.\n\n\nIn general, you should not manually create RDDs unless you have a very, very specific reason for doing so. They are a much lower-level API that provides a lot of power but also lacks a lot of the optimizations that are available in the Structured APIs.\n\n\nThe Spark driver The driver is the process “in the driver seat” of your Spark Application. It is the controller of the execution of a Spark Application and maintains all of the state of the Spark cluster (the state and tasks of the executors). It must interface with the cluster manager in order to actually get physical resources and launch executors. At the end of the day, this is just a process on a physical machine that is responsible for maintaining the state of the application running on the cluster.\n\n\nSpark executors are the processes that perform the tasks assigned by the Spark driver. Executors have one core responsibility: take the tasks assigned by the driver, run them, and report back their state (success or failure) and results. Each Spark Application has its own separate executor processes.\n\n\nThe Spark Driver and Executors do not exist in a void, and this is where the cluster manager comes in. The cluster manager is responsible for maintaining a cluster of machines that will run your Spark Application(\n\n\nLastly, if you want to use RDDs, we definitely recommend using Scala or Java.\n\n\nAcross all languages, DataFrames, Datasets, and SQL are equivalent in speed. This means that if you’re using DataFrames in any of these languages, performance is equal. However, if you’re going to be defining UDFs, you’ll take a performance hit writing those in Python or R, and to some extent a lesser performance hit in Java and Scala. If you want to optimize for pure performance, it would behoove you to try and get back to DataFrames and SQL as quickly as possible.\n\n\nAvoiding Cartesian joins or even full outer joins is often low-hanging fruit for stability and optimizations because these can often be optimized into different filtering style joins when you look at the entire data flow instead of just that one particular job area.\n\n\nJoins are a common area for optimization. The biggest weapon you have when it comes to optimizing joins is simply educating yourself about what each join does and how it’s performed. This will help you the most. Additionally, equi-joins are the easiest for Spark to optimize at this point and therefore should be preferred wherever possible.\n\n\nBeyond that, simple things like trying to use the filtering ability of inner joins by changing join ordering can yield large speedups. Additionally, using broadcast join hints can help Spark make intelligent planning decisions when it comes to creating query plans,\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Data-Science-the-Hard-Parts":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Data-Science-the-Hard-Parts","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Data/Data Science/Data Science the Hard Parts.md","title":"Data Science the Hard Parts","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","data","data-science","data-analysis","communication","corporate","business","business-communications","metrics","data/lift-analysis","data/hypothesis-testing","data/communication","stakeholder-management"],"content":"Data Science the Hard Parts\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book dives into the difficult aspects of data science. The difficult aspects are business value proposition, communication and measuring impact. These topics are discussed and methods for doing this the right way are presented.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked this book, mostly the first part, as the second part was more of a walkthrough of hypothesis testing, and I felt I slipped a bit on that part.\nThe most important aspect was that a data science output in itself is just information; therefore, the only concrete value from such a project is the actions that come from it.\nThe aspect of communication discussed is important; as a data scientist, you are responsible for outputting models, communicating the results, and acting as an evangelist. My experience so far reflects this as well. So it was very nice to know that I am not the only one.\nI did find the concept of lift to be quite interesting, and I would like to work more on this concept.\nAnother important aspect is that a data scientist owns the data, which is a huge advantage in all discussions.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nI’ll posit that learning and practicing data science is hard. It is hard because you are expected to be a great programmer who not only knows the intricacies of data structures and their computational complexity but is also well versed in Python and SQL. Statistics and the latest machine learning predictive techniques ought to be a second language to you, and naturally you need to be able to apply all of these to solve actual business problems that may arise.\n\n\nBut the job is also hard because you have to be a great communicator who tells compelling stories to nontechnical stakeholders who may not be used to making decisions in a data-driven way.\n\n\nIn my book Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science (O’Reilly), I presented this general approach to value creation with data:\nThe idea is simple: data by itself creates no value. The value is derived from the quality of the decisions that are made.\n\n\nData scientists have one advantage over the rest of the organization: they own the data and are constantly asked to calculate and present the key metrics of the team.\n\n\nI’ve seen this mistake over and over: a data scientist spends a lot of time running their model or analysis, and when it’s time to deliver the presentation, they just read the nice graphs and data visualizations they have.\n\n\nWhenever I decide to start a new project, I always solve the problem backwards: how can the decision-maker use the results of my analysis or model? What are the levers that they have? Is it even actionable? Never start without the answers to these questions.\n\n\nOnce you have figured out the so what, it’s a great practice to write it down. Don’t let it play a secondary role by focusing only on the technical stuff.\n\n\nThe best data scientists I’ve seen are go-getters who own the project end to end: they ensure that every team plays its part. They develop the necessary stakeholder management and other so-called soft skills to ensure that this happens.\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to make product recommendations even when the product manager disagrees with you, or to suggest alternative communication strategies when your marketing stakeholder believes you’re trespassing.\n\n\nYour aim is to create measurable value. How do you do that? Here’s one trick that applies more generally. A data scientist does X to impact a metric M with the hope it will improve on the current baseline. You can think of M as a function of X: Impact of X = M ( X ) - M ( baseline ) Let’s put this principle into practice with a churn prediction model: X Churn prediction model\n\n\n*Your aim is to create measurable value. How do you do that? Here’s one trick that applies more generally. A data scientist does X to impact a metric M with the hope it will improve on the current baseline. You can think of M as a function of X: Impact of X = M ( X ) - M ( baseline *\n\n\n*Do you see how value is derived from actions and not from data or a model? So let’s adjust the principle to make it absolutely clear that actions (A) affect the metric: Impact of X = M ( A ( X ) ) - M ( A ( baseline *\n\n\nYou can have a great ML model that is predictive and hopefully interpretable. But if the actions taken by the actual decision-makers don’t impact the metric, the value of your team will be zero (so what).\n\n\nI’ve found Survival of the Savvy: High-Integrity Political Tactics for Career and Company Success by Rick Brandon and Marty Seldman (Free Press) quite useful for dealing with company politics in a very pragmatic way.\n\n\nMetrics are measurable by definition.\n\n\nFunnels are a sequence of actions that go one after the other.\n\n\nStock-flow decompositions are useful when you care about a metric that accumulates. Let’s start by defining these concepts: a stock variable is one that accumulates and is measured at a specific point in time. Flow variables don’t accumulate and are measured over a period of time. A useful analogy is a bathtub: the volume of water at time t is equal to the volume at time t − 1, plus the water that came in through the faucet between these two moments in time, minus the water that went down the drain.\n\n\nAnother common scenario is trying to improve revenue. The trick here is to multiply and divide by a reasonable metric to arrive at submetrics that are most easily leveraged: Revenue = Revenue UnitsSold × Units Sold = Unit Price × Sales This shows how to decompose revenue as the product of unit (average) price and sales: R = p × q . To increase revenue you can either increase the price or sales.\n\n\nDesirable properties that good metrics should have. A good metric must be measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.\n\n\nFunnel-type decompositions are easy to use, and once you get used to them, you’ll start to see funnels everywhere.\n\n\nFinding root causes for changes in time is usually very hard. You need enough variation in the drivers to estimate impacts.\n\n\nGrowth decompositions are useful to get hints about the underlying root causes.\n\n\nBelieve that a natural growth path in data science (DS) is to go from making things overly complex to doing smart simplification. By smart I mean what Einstein expressed when saying you should aim at making “everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”\n\n\nThe Laws of Simplicity by John Maeda (MIT Press) takes a designer’s point of view on how to achieve simplicity.\n\n\nThe KPI is a function of your ML model performance metric. I emphasize the function part because you need to be able to convert the performance metric into a monetary value, like revenue, to make it comparable with the costs.\n\n\nConsider the lift of having women as CEOs in the US. Under a random selection baseline, there should be roughly 50% female CEOs. One study estimates this number at 32%. The lift of the current job market selection mechanism is 0.32/0.5 = 0.64, so women are underrepresented relative to the baseline population frequency.\n\n\nAs the name suggests, the lift measures how much the aggregate in one group increases or decreases relative to the baseline. A ratio larger or smaller than one is known as uplift or downlift, respectively. If there’s no lift, the ratio is one.\n\n\nYou can compute lifts with classifier models by showing the predictive performance of the model relative to the overall sample. I presented a churn prediction example and computed lifts for true positive rates across score deciles.\n\n\nA lift is a ratio of an aggregate metric for one group to another. Averages are the most common aggregation method.\n\n\nMore generally, lifts can be applied to understand the extent of self-selection or survivorship bias in your sample.\n\n\nData Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques by Ian Witten et al.\n\n\nTo have end-to-end ownership, it is critical to persuade your stakeholders to take action with your results.\n\n\nWhat is the objective that you want to achieve? In general narratives, it could be to persuade or engage. These apply also to data science (DS), of course, but most importantly, you want to create value, and for that you need to drive actions. A successful story should help you accomplish this objective.

They have become a standard in tech companies, and I’ve made it a practice to always start with one.\n\n\nI tend to structure the TL;DR in the same way as the narrative: What, So What, Now What.\n\n\nA good tip is to think of your document as a news article and think about alternative headlines. Great headlines in data science must have the same properties I’ve been talking about: simple, credible, memorable, and actionable. Credibility restricts you from overselling.\n\n\nIf a slide doesn’t have a clear message consistent with your narrative, drop it.\n\n\nIt Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences: A Writer’s Guide to Crafting Killer Sentences by June Casagrande\n\n\nWith stakeholders, I rarely use histograms or KDEs as these usually have more information than needed to deliver the message.\n\n\nIntuitively, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measures the amount of information provided by the model (signal) relative to that from the unexplained part of the model (noise).\n\n\nA variable is latent if it can’t be directly observed but affects an observable outcome.\n\n\nMarginal effects in classification models measure the impact of an infinitesimal change in one feature on the probability of interest.\n\n\nIn a bivariate setting, the slope depends on the covariance between the outcome and the feature, and the variance of the feature.\n\n\nDirect causation As you would like to interpret it ( x 1 → y ). Reverse causation x 1 ← y , since the covariance is symmetric on the arguments. Confounders A confounder is any third variable that affects both x and y, but these are otherwise unrelated\n\n\nThe Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem (FWL) is a powerful result that helps build a lot of intuition about the inner workings of linear regression. It essentially says that you can interpret the OLS estimates as partialled-out effects, that is, effects net of any other dependencies between features.\n\n\nThe Python script allows you to test that both versions of the general covariance formula give the same results (using the version argument). An important property of OLS is that the estimated residuals are orthogonal to the regressors (or any function of the regressors), a process also known as orthogonalization. You can use this fact to show that the two covariance formulas are equivalent. Importantly, orthogonalization always has to be performed on the feature of interest. If you only orthogonalize the outcome y, the covariance formula is no longer valid, unless the features are already orthogonal with each other, so in general: α k ≠ Cov(y ˜ k ,x k ) Var(x k ) Why Should You Care About FWL? I’ve presented several versions of the orthogonalization result, so you should expect it to be relevant. The main takeaway is this: You\n\n\nYou can interpret each coefficient from linear regression\n\n\nVariables like Dl and Dr = 1 − Dl are perfectly correlated, it’s normal to find both ranking very high in terms of feature importance. Since they provide the exact same information, the performance of the algorithm doesn’t improve by including both. This is one useful intuitive fact that arises naturally by understanding OLS.\n\n\nAs the name suggests, data leakage occurs when some of the data used for training a model isn’t available when you deploy your model into production, creating subpar predictive performance in the latter stage.\n\n\nAs a starting point, I separate the learning process into two stages: Training stage This is the stage where you train a model by dividing your sample into training and testing, etc. Scoring stage Once you’ve trained your model and you’ve deployed it in production, you use it to score a sample. It can be a one-at-a-time prediction, as in online, real-time scoring, or scoring of a larger sample.\n\n\nA typical symptom of leakage is having unusually high predictive performance on your test sample. You must rely on your knowledge of the problem and the company’s experience with these models.\n\n\nThe litmus test for an ML model is its performance in production. You should direct all of your time and effort to ensure that this is the case.\n\n\nA more direct definition is that a model is production ready when it’s set for consumption by the end user, be it a human or a system. By consumption I mean making use of the predictive scores, which can take place offline or online, and can be done by a human or by another system or service\n\n\nWhatever you decide to use, my recommendation is to keep it simple. Often, all you need is a dashboard that plots this metadata, which enables you to set up simple alerts for when changes occur. When you productionize a model, it’s often the case that the simpler, the better.\n\n\nDeploying in production is a complex sequence of steps, so the recommendation is to keep each of these as simple as possible. Unnecessary complexity may end up compounding, making it very hard to find the source of a problem when this comes up\n\n\nEx ante storytelling has four main steps: defining the problem, creating hypotheses, feature engineering, and training the model\n\n\nWhat do you want to predict and why? This is better done early and collaboratively with your stakeholders to ensure you have their buy-in, as many promising ML projects fail because of this.\n\n\nSome high-level recommendations to come up with hypotheses for your problem are: Know your problem really well. The not-so-secret sauce to building great ML models is to have substantial domain expertise. Be curious. This is one defining trait that makes a data scientist a scientist. Challenge the status quo. Don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo. This includes challenging your own hypotheses and iterating when needed (be aware of any signs of confirmation bias on your side).\n\n\nAccumulated local effects (ALE) is a relatively new method that takes care of the shortcomings of PDPs when handling correlated features.\n\n\nAs discussed, the problem with PDPs arises from imposing unrealistic values of a feature given its correlation with the remaining ones, which end up biasing the estimates.\n\n\nEx ante storytelling starts by creating stories or hypotheses about what drives the outcome you aim to predict. These are then translated to features through a multistep feature engineering stage.\n\n\nRolf Dobelli’s The Art of Thinking Clearly (Harper) is good if you want to gain some knowledge of the many biases and heuristics that are present in human behavior.\n\n\nSoledad Galli’s Python Feature Engineering Cookbook,\n\n\nOn ML interpretability, I highly recommend Christoph Molnar’s Interpretable Machine Learning:\n\n\nFinally, Michael Munn and David Pitman give a very comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different techniques in Explainable AI for Practitioners: Designing and Implementing Explainable ML Solutions\n\n\nAt the time of writing, two Python packages are available that calculate ALEs: ALEPython and alibi.\n\n\nIn “Expanding AI’s Impact With Organizational Learning”, Sam Ransbotham and his collaborators argue that only “10% of companies obtain significant financial benefit from artificial intelligence technologies.”\n\n\nMoving from prediction to decisions is critical if you want to find positive ROI for your data science practice. ML is a set of predictive algorithms that can, first and foremost, greatly improve your organization’s decision-making capabilities.\n\n\nThreshold decision rules abound in ML. Many regression and classification models give rise to simple decision rules that trigger actions if the predicted outcome is greater than, equal to, or lower than a predetermined threshold.\n\n\nIn the past I’ve argued that incrementality is the holy grail of data science. This statement depends critically on the hypothesis that I’ve maintained throughout: that data science creates value by improving a company’s decision-making capabilities.\n\n\nIncrementality is just another name for causal inference applied to decision-making analytics. If you recall from Figure 14-1, a typical decision comprises an action or lever, and an outcome that depends on the underlying uncertainty. If the lever improves the outcome, and you’re able to isolate any other factors that might explain the change, you can say (with some degree of confidence) that it was incremental. For later reference, the action is also known as the treatment, following the more classical medical literature of controlled experiments, where some patients receive a treatment, and the remaining control group receives a placebo.\n\n\nThis process is often called the back-door criterion: with confounders you have to close any back doors by controlling for them, and with colliders the opposite applies; otherwise, you open those back doors and can’t identify the causal effect.\n\n\nCausalML is another Python library, created by Uber. It includes several ML-based causal inference estimators for uplift modeling,\n\n\nTo understand uplift modeling, imagine that you train a cross-selling classifier that will predict which of your customers will purchase a given product in your company. Once trained, you can plot the distribution of scores where I’ve divided all scored customers into three groups. Group A are customers with a high probability of a purchase. Customers in group B are less likely, and C are deemed highly unlikely to purchase. Which customers should you target in your campaign? Many people decide to target group A, but these customers are most likely going to make an organic purchase, so you can use this costly incentive to target other customers. On the other side, group C are so unlikely that the incentive will be prohibitively costly. With this rationale, group B is a better candidate to be targeted.\n\n\nIncrementality is causal inference applied to estimating whether a change in a lever improved a business outcome.\n\n\nUnder the assumption that data science creates value by improving our decision-making capabilities, incrementality is critical to understand which decisions are worthy of expanding and which should be rolled back.\n\n\nIn its simplest form, an A/B test is a method to evaluate which one of two alternatives is better in terms of a given metric. A denotes the default or baseline alternative, and B is the contender.\n\n\nA/B tests are also called randomized controlled trials because, by design, selection into the treatment is random, thereby breaking any confounder or selection bias that may arise.\n\n\nThe minimum detectable effect (MDE) is the minimum effect of the experiment that you can detect for a given significance level and statistical power.\n\n\nDon’t forget, the MDE refers to the incremental change in a metric caused by the treatment, which follows from the definition of the random variable you’re doing inference on: θ ^ = Y ¯ B - Y ¯ A\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Data/Data Science/Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science.md","title":"Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","streamlit","data/data-visualization","data","python","deployment","dashboards"],"content":"Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a welcoming introduction to a Python module that has seen rapid growth. It offers a brief overview of the application’s capabilities and shows how its user-friendly nature makes it an inclusive tool for both new and experienced data scientists.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a good book; I liked that I had some very brief experience with it before starting. I just did the Hello World application, plus some other stuff. I think it is a very interesting tool for data scientists to use and deploy; I bet there are a ton of applications that live protected by a simple password.\nDeployment is key here; being able to deploy easily would be something that would be very interesting to look into.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nStreamlit is a web application framework that helps you build and develop Python-based web applications that can be used to share analytics results, build complex interactive experiences, and illustrate new machine learning models.\n\n\nI truly believe that Streamlit could be as valuable to you and your work as it has been to mine and wrote this to bring you quickly up to speed so you can accelerate your learning curve and get to building web applications in minutes and hours instead of days.\n\n\nStreamlit run and then pointing Streamlit toward the Python script that houses our app’s code.\n\n\nSt.pyplot() is a function that lets us use all the power of the popular matplotlib library and push our matplotlib graph to Streamlit.\n\n\nMore specifically, st.title() will place a large block of text in our app, st.header() uses a slightly smaller font than st.title(), and st.subheader() uses an even smaller one. Other than those three, st.markdown() will allow anyone already familiar with Markdown to use the popular markup language in our Streamlit apps.\n\n\nWe broadly have two options for Streamlit development. Develop in Streamlit and st.write() as a debugger. Explore in Jupyter and then copy to Streamlit.\n\n\nThe easiest way to make a Streamlit app more efficient is through caching, which is storing some results in memory so that the app does not repeat the same work whenever possible.\n\n\nImporting Python visualization libraries into Streamlit. In this section, we will cover the following libraries:  (a) Plotly (for interactive visualizations) (b) Seaborn+Matplotlib (for classic statistical visualizations) (c) Bokeh (for interactive visualization in web browsers) (d) Altair (for declarative, interactive visualizations) (e) PyDeck (for interactive map-based visualizations\n\n\nWe can use the st.stop() function to stop the app from running if the password is incorrect using the following code:\n\n\nPassword_guess = st.text_input(‘What is the Password?’) if password_guess != st.secrets[“password”]: st.stop(\n\n\nThroughout this chapter, we’ll work with elements including sidebars, columns, colors, and themes to extend our ability to make beautiful Streamlit applications.\n\n\nHowever, Streamlit allows us to format our app into dynamic columns using the st.beta_columns() feature. As of now, the columns feature is in beta\n\n\nCol1, col2, col3 = st.beta_columns((1,1,1)) with col1: st.write(‘First column’) with col2: st.write(‘Second column’) with col3: st.write(‘Third column’\n\n\nSt.beta_columns() defines three columns of equal length, and we use the with notation to print some text in each. We can also call the st.write() function (or any other Streamlit function that writes content to our Streamlit app) directly on our predefined columns for the same outcome, as shown in the following code.\n\n\nStreamlit allows us to configure a few essential page-specific features at the top of each Streamlit app.\n\n\nGetting specific colors in user input through the st.color_picker() feature, and finally learning how to use Streamlit themes.\n\n\nStreamlit-lottie uses the lottie open source library to allow us to add web-native animations (such as a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) file) into our Streamlit apps. It is frankly a wonderful library for beautifying Streamlit apps and was created by Andy Fanilo, a prolific Streamlit app creator.\n\n\nThe popular pandas Python library is the standard Python data analysis library and often tops the list of the most popular and useful Python libraries for data scientists. pandas-profiling creates an automatically generated EDA on top of any DataFrame we create and shows us everything, from descriptive statistics to how many duplicate rows we have.\n\n\nStreamlit Sharing is quick, easy, and very effective for most applications but has a few downsides, mainly that we are limited by only being able to host three free applications at once and that we also are limited in the computational power at hand.\n\n\nHeroku account: Heroku is a popular platform that data scientists and software engineers use to host their applications, models, and APIs (application programming interfaces), and is owned by Salesforce.\n\n\nHeroku Command-Line Interface (CLI): To use Heroku effectively, we will need to download the Heroku CLI, which will allow us to run Heroku commands.\n\n\nHeroku is slightly faster and simpler than AWS, and more cumbersome than Streamlit Sharing.\n\n\nAWS has literally hundreds of service options for everything from deploying ML models to compute resources to everything in between. In this book so far, we have referred to the services listed in the following screenshot under the central name AWS, but to be more precise, we are going to be using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or Amazon EC2 for short.\n\n\nWe need to set our Security settings in a way to allow other users online to interact with our web app by adding a new Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) rule by clicking Add Rule and setting the Port Range column to 8501, the custom Streamlit port.\n\n\nOften, AWS commands feel like magic incantations, especially when you are first getting started.\n\n\nComprehension of a topic goes through the roof when I actually apply it myself in practice. Streamlit is perfect for this. It allows you to give new ideas a shot in a responsive, fun environment that can be easily shared with others. Learning data science can be collaborative, which leads me to the next reason for creating data projects in Streamlit.\n\n\nOne feature currently in beta on Streamlit for Teams but with an expected release date of late 2021 is Google-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication for our applications.\n\n\nNumPy was certainly pre 1.0, and there was kind of this revelation that there was this amazing library called NumPy, all of a sudden, that made Python as good as MATLAB, and then after a while, way was better than MATLAB. That was the beginning of Python becoming the dominant language of numerical computation, and then ultimately machine learning.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Modelling-Mindsets":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Data-Science/Modelling-Mindsets","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Data/Data Science/Modelling Mindsets.md","title":"Modelling Mindsets","links":["Science/Math/Statistics/Calling-Bullshit","Science/Math/Statistics/A-Field-Guide-to-Lies"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","modeling","data-science","statistics","bayesian"],"content":"Modelling Mindsets\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is mostly about different ways of thinking about models, in the context of making models of real-world phenomena. It dives into the cons and benefits of each mindset and tries to explain how knowing each is a good advantage.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is similar to the Bernoullis Fallacy book in that it delves into Bayesian versus frequentist statistical modelling.  It is also interesting when it comes to comparison with books such as Calling Bullshit and A Field Guide to Lies which talks about the pitfalls of some of these mindsets.\nIt is important to have more than one mindset.\nI have not experienced Likelihoodism as a mindset before, so interesting to learn more about that.\n“A Modelling mindset limits the questions that can be asked” - Very interesting thought and makes sense.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nData are noisy and high-dimensional – most of the information will be irrelevant to the task. No matter how long a human analyzes the data, it’s difficult to gain insights just by sheer human willpower.\n\n\nA model simplifies and represents an aspect of the world.\n\n\nFor our purpose, we’ll go with this definition: a mathematical model that consists of variables and functions.\n\n\nMindsets differ in how they interpret probabilities – or whether probabilities are central to the mindset at all.\n\n\nIn supervised machine learning, for example, everything becomes a prediction problem, while in Bayesian inference, the goal is to update beliefs about the world using probability theory.\n\n\nA modelling mindset limits the questions that can be asked.\n\n\nPremise: The world is best approached through probability distributions. Consequence: Estimate aspects of these distributions using statistical models to reason under uncertainty.\n\n\nAnother assumption is homoscedasticity: The variance of the target is independent of other variables.\n\n\nHomoscedasticity can be checked with a residual\n\n\nHomoscedasticity can be checked with a residual plot, which shows on the x-axis the values of a variable and on the y-axis the residuals (actual target minus its predicted value) against each of the other variables.\n\n\nOnce you understand frequentist inference, you can understand the analysis section of many research articles.\n\n\nThe focus on p-values encourages p-hacking: the search for significant results to get a scientific paper published. P-hacking leads to many false findings in research.\n\n\nParameters are variables. Therefore, the modeling goal has to be the parameter distribution given the data. But there is a problem. It’s unclear how parameters given data are distributed. The distribution of data given parameters is more natural to estimate. Fortunately, a mathematical “trick” helps: Bayes’ theorem.\n\n\nThe first consideration in choosing a prior is the parameter space, which is the set or range of values that the parameters can take on. For example, can the parameter only take on positive values? Then the prior must have a probability of zero for negative values, for example, the Gamma distribution\n\n\nLikelihoodism is the purist among the statistical modeling mindsets: it fully embraces the likelihood function as evidence for a statistical hypothesis.\n\n\n“The likelihood principle asserts that two observations that generate identical likelihood functions are equivalent as evidence\n\n\nImagine two experiments that produce the same data: Flip the coin 12 times. Observe 9 heads. Flip the coin until the tail appears 3 times. The third tail appears on the 12th flip. Same outcome but different stopping criteria. Should both experiments come to the same conclusion about the fairness of the coin? Depends on the mindset. Both experiments have the same likelihood, up to a constant factor. Likelihoodists would say that both experiments carry the same evidence. Frequentists might use a hypothesis test with a confidence level of 5%. Since the experiments have different stopping criteria, the frequentist uses different tests. As a result, the frequentist would reject the null hypothesis in experiment 2), but would not reject it in experiment 1).\n\n\nIf the likelihood for hypothesis A is larger than for hypothesis B, given some data, then the data counts as evidence that supports A over B, and the ratio of the likelihoods measures the strength of this evidence\n\n\nThere are many individual methods that aim to provide causal modeling. One example is “honest causal forests,” which are based on random forests and used to model heterogeneity in treatment effects (Athey and Imbens 2016).\n\n\nCausal modeling is mainly a recipe for translating causal models into statistical estimators in the following four steps (Pearl 2009): Formulate causal estimand. Construct causal model. Identify statistical model. Estimate effect.\n\n\nIdentification can be complicated, but there are at least some simple rules that give first hints for which variables to include and which to exclude: Include all confounders and the common causes of both the variable of interest and the outcome. For example, in Figure 8.2, the number of cars confounds the relation between the number of streets and air quality. Exclude colliders. The number of bicycles is a collider. Adding colliders to a model opens an unwanted dependence between the cause of study and the target. Consider mediators. The number of trees mediates the effect of streets on air quality. Inclusion in the model depends on the goal of the analysis (direct, indirect, or total effect of streets).\n\n\nUnsupervised learning is a good approach to the curse of dimensionality, but even so, unsupervised learning can suffer greatly from the curse. The more features, the more difficult the interpretation of clusters becomes, for example.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Turning-Data-Into-Wisdom":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Data/Turning-Data-Into-Wisdom","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Data/Turning Data Into Wisdom.md","title":"Turning Data Into Wisdom","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","data","data/eda","strategy","data/strategy"],"content":"Turning Data Into Wisdom\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the way we use data to communicate.  We are using data to tell stories and to get people to make the right decisions.\n🎨 Impressions\nUnderstanding that the people not the data is the lever is the most important lesson of this book.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nInvestments in data strategy and analytics will be useless—and can even be harmful—unless individuals and organizations can leverage anthropological skills and understand behaviors and psychology to provide the right context for the data\n\n\nThe data-informed decision-making process is iterative and not linear, and different types of decisions may require different parts of the steps or different tools within each step.\n\n\nMost decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions.\n\n\n*The six phases in the process are the following:\n\nFormulate and ask a focused analytical question .\nAcquire the best available data.\nCritically appraise and analyze the data.\nApply the experiences and beliefs of yourself and others to the data to make a decision, being aware of any bias you or others may hold.\nAnnounce and communicate the decision.\nAssess the outcomes from the decision.\n\n\n\nAccording to management consultant W. Edwards Deming, 94 percent of problems in business are systems driven, and only 6 percent are people driven.\n\n\n*There are five key active-listening techniques:\n\nPay attention.\nLet the speaker know you are listening.\nDefer any judgment.\nRespond appropriately.\nProvide feedback.\n\n\n\nData-informed decision-making should follow a systemic and systematic process,\n\n\n“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.”  —Daniel Boorstin\n\n\nProjection bias is the tendency to overpredict future preferences by trying to match them to current preferences.\n\n\nAvailability bias is the tendency to remember and recall something that has happened recently, something you personally observed, or something more vivid and recognizable.\n\n\nAbsence of evidence bias is the tendency to fail to consider the degree of completeness of the information.\n\n\nConfirmation bias is a type of bias that involves favoring information that confirms previously existing beliefs that someone holds.\n\n\nClustering illusion is the tendency to see patterns where there are not any.\n\n\nOptimism bias is the tendency to believe that you are less likely to experience a negative event as a result of your decision, and thus you overestimate the probability of a positive outcome for your decision.\n\n\nOverconfidence bias is similar to optimism bias but relates more to overconfidence in your skills when compared to others.\n\n\nCompetitor neglect is the tendency in business to focus on your own company’s capabilities, plans, and data, neglecting data from external forces and competitors.\n\n\nOstrich bias is the tendency to ignore dangerous or negative information when making your decision.\n\n\nAnchoring bias is the tendency to be influenced by the first shown information. This causes tunnel vision and people failing to make adjustments to account for subsequent information.\n\n\nAmbiguity bias is the tendency to favor an outcome that is more knowable compared to alternatives that are not.\n\n\n“If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing. ”  —W. Edwards Deming\n\n\nType 1 decisions are irreversible decisions, like quitting a job or changing a product direction, and Type 2 decisions are decisions that you can always revert back from if they end up not being ideal, like executing a specific marketing campaign or changing a vendor in your supply chain.\n\n\n“What gets measured gets improved.”  —Peter Drucker\n\n\nVery useful for dealing with qualitative data. For example,\n\n\nANOVA. A statistical test called ANOVA , short for analysis of variance, is the best option when you have more than two levels of an independent variable. For example, if your independent variable is “average annual per capita sales” of your product and your data contains three regions (America, Europe, and Asia), with ANOVA, you can test to see if there is a statistically significant difference in average annual per capita sales between the regions.\n\n\nWith nonparametric tests, there is no need for the distribution to be normally distributed. For independent samples, use the Mann-Whitney U test . For paired groups, use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test . For tests of more than two levels of independent variables, use the Kruskal-Wallis test rather than ANOVA.\n\n\nMarkov analysis is a technique that determines the probability of future occurrences of an event by analyzing presently known probabilities of those events. The Markov analysis process involves defining the likelihood of a future action, given the current state of a variable. Once the probabilities of future actions at each state are defined, a decision tree can be drawn and the probability of a result can be calculated, given the current state of a variable. Markov analysis has a number of applications in business to help companies make data-informed decisions.\n\n\nHowever, there are certain triggers that increase the likelihood of bias being introduced. These include cognitive overload, ambiguous information, perceived threats, being short on time, emotional overload, and overconfidence.\n\n\nIn their book Primal Leadership: Realizing the Power of Emotional Intelligence , Dr. Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, and Annie McKee state that the best leaders act according to one or more of six distinct approaches to leadership: visionary, coaching, affiliative, democratic, pace-setting, and commanding:\n*Visionary. Visionary leaders mobilize their teams toward a vision.\nCoaching. Coaching leaders develop employees for the future. Affiliative. Affiliative leaders create emotional bonds and harmony with their teams.\nDemocratic. Democratic leaders build consensus with their teams through education and participation.\nPace-setting. Pace-setting leaders expect their teams to be self-directed and to excel.\nCommanding. Commanding leaders demand immediate compliance from their teams.\nTheir research concluded that the best results happened with leaders who practice more than one style on any given day.\n\n\nDouble-loop learning, first modeled by business theorist Chris Argyris and organizational consultant Donald Schön, is a reflective process in which the decision-making team challenges the assumptions, norms, and objectives for the decision. Sometimes, feedback from a decision made is that the decision may not have been optimal because the underlying assumptions of the system behind the problem were inaccurate.\n\n\nSingle-loop learning is when the lessons learned are on the actions and decisions taken themselves. Double-loop learning goes further to actually question and modify the system and mental model of the underlying assumptions tied to the problem statement.\n\n\n“Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice.”  —Stephen Few\n\n\nUpstream stakeholders are individuals who are involved in the implementation of the program or offering the decision has set forth. Downstream stakeholders are individuals who will receive, use, or participate in the program or offering the decision has set forth. The downstream stakeholders can be directly or indirectly impacted. Direct impactees are typically employees within the program or offering for which the decision was made, while indirect impactees are typically external to the organization or group.\n\n\nA major part of properly communicating your story is to help stakeholders see what you want them to see while limiting anything that can distract them.\n\n\nColin Ware, author of Information Visualization: Perception for Design , defined four categories of preattentive visual attributes:\nIconic memory , a form of sensory memory, processes and stores visual information automatically, many times unconsciously, and in less than a second. Since this process is automatic and happens unconsciously before we are even paying attention, it is called preattentive processing . This process detects certain visual attributes. These visual attributes “pop out” at us without conscious effort.\n\n\nThe Pyramid principle , first created by business consultant Barbara Minto, advocates that ideas should always form a pyramid under a single thought,\n\n\nThe Pyramid principle is not designed to include the full story and communication. It focuses on the decision itself.

It gives the reader clear and good examples of how the economy functions.\n🎨 Impressions\nI felt it gave me a better understanding of the core principles of economics and how they are applied. Not very difficult to understand concepts, which made it easier to read and reflect on.\nGresham´s Law on how “Bad Money Drives Out Good” was interesting.\nI think reading a book such as this is important for everyone that is interested in politics and society. If this book is easy to read, then it is no excuse for people not to read it. If you don’t understand the principles of economics, you are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI think I became more aware of my tendency to bias myself against issues that I know are right but my personal preferences have made me against it. One example is being very lenient about banning cars and removing parking spaces because personally, I am not a fan of cars. This should not be needed according to basic economic theory.\nHowever, I am not completely convinced that this is a black-and-white matter, considering externalities and other dumb governmental policies that lead to legacy infrastructure.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nOne of the ways of doing this is to look at economic policies and economic systems in terms of the incentives they create, rather than simply the goals they pursue. This means that consequences matter more than intentions—and not just the immediate consequences but also the longer-run repercussions of decisions, policies, and institutions.\n\n\nEconomics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses.\n\n\nDuring the days of the Soviet Union, for example, that country’s industries used more electricity than American industries used, even though Soviet industries produced a smaller amount of output than American industries produced. More steel, cement, and other resources used for producing a given output likewise resulted in less output in the Soviet Union than in countries such as Japan or Germany.\n\n\nYeltsin’s aide said that the Houston supermarket experience destroyed the last vestiges of Yeltsin’s belief in the Communist system, setting the stage for his becoming the first leader of post-Communist Russia.\n\n\nThe price that one producer is willing to pay for any given ingredient becomes the price that other producers are forced to pay for that same ingredient.\n\n\nResources tend to flow to their most valued uses when there is price competition in the marketplace.\n\n\n“From 5 to 15 percent of the workers in the majority of enterprises are surplus and are kept ‘just in case.’”\n\n\nHuman beings are going to make mistakes in any kind of economic system. The key question is: What kinds of incentives and constraints will force them to correct their own mistakes?\n\n\nEvery cow in the European Union gets more subsidies per day than most sub-Saharan Africans have to live on.\n\n\nWhile less than one-fifth of farming income in the United States comes from government subsidies, more than 40 percent of farming income in Japan comes from such subsidies, as does more than 60 percent in South Korea and Norway.\n\n\nTherefore, the net effect of price control was that “the city lived in high spirits until all at once provisions gave out” and Antwerp had no choice but to surrender to the Spaniards.\n\n\nWe need education in the obvious more than investigation of the obscure.\n\n\nThe painful fact that poor people end up paying more than affluent people for many goods and services has a very plain—and systemic—explanation. It often costs more to deliver goods and services in low-income neighborhoods.\n\n\nFor example, an inner city shopping center in one midwestern city had to spend 15 percent more on security guards and lighting than a comparable suburban shopping complex.\n\n\nBut it is both intellectually and emotionally easier to blame high prices on those who collect them, rather than on those who cause them. It is also more politically popular to blame outsiders, especially if those outsiders are of a different ethnic background.\n\n\nRent control “appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.”\n\n\nNothing is easier than thinking of additional requirements that might be useful in some way or other, and nothing is harder than remembering to ask the crucial incremental question: At what cost?\n\n\nIn short, while there are economies of scale, there are also what economists call “diseconomies of scale.”\n\n\nIn the Soviet Union, where there was a fascination with economies of scale and a disregard of diseconomies of scale, both its industrial and agricultural enterprises were the largest in the world. The average Soviet farm, for example, was ten times the size of the average American farm and employed more than ten times as many workers.\n\n\nThe first corporation in America was the Harvard Corporation, formed in the seventeenth century to govern America’s first college.\n\n\nMonopoly is the enemy of efficiency, whether under capitalism or socialism.\n\n\nAs one study noted, “although 54 percent of the workplace is male, men account for 92 percent of all job-related deaths.”\n\n\nDuring the era of the Soviet Union and Cold War competition, the Soviets used to boast of the fact that an average Soviet box car moved more freight per year than an average American box car. But, far from indicating that their economy was more efficient, this showed that Soviet railroads lacked the abundant capital of the American railroad industry, and that Soviet labor had less valuable alternative uses of its time than did American labor\n\n\nAlmost by definition, all these organizations exist to keep the price of labor from being what it would be otherwise in free and open competition in the market.\n\n\nThe promotion of economic equality and the alleviation of poverty are distinct and often conflicting.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the market does not depend on officials understanding it.\n\n\nEstimated in the early twenty-first century that a million Chinese a month were rising out of poverty.\n\n\nIt is also true that unemployed Americans spend more time per day looking for work—more than four times as much time as unemployed workers in Germany, Britain or Sweden.\n\n\nA tourist in New York’s Greenwich Village decided to have his portrait sketched by a sidewalk artist. He received a very fine sketch, for which he was charged $100. “That’s expensive,” he said to the artist, “but I’ll pay it, because it is a great sketch. But, really, it took you only five minutes.” “Twenty years and five minutes,” the artist replied.\n\n\nRisk-taking is the mother’s milk of capitalism.\n\n\nBonds differ from stocks because bonds are legal commitments to pay fixed amounts of money on a fixed date. Stocks are simply shares of the business that issues them, and there is no guarantee that the business will make a profit in the first place, much less pay out dividends instead of re-investing these profits in the business itself.\n\n\nAs one development economist put it, land reform can be “a bad joke played on those who can least afford to laugh.”\n\n\nFor example, the median ages in Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Tanzania are all below twenty, while the median ages in Japan, Italy, and Germany are all over forty. Such huge age gaps mean that the real significance of some international differences in income may be seriously overstated.\n\n\nAs John Maynard Keynes said, “It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.”\n\n\n“Wall Street and Washington expend megawatts of energy trying to decipher the delphic pronouncements of Alan Greenspan.”\n\n\nThe study of human institutions is always a search for the most tolerable imperfections.\n\n\nYou know, doing what is right is easy. The problem is knowing what is right.\n\n\nForeign firms which hired Russian workers and even Russian executives made it a point not to hire Russian accountants.\n\n\n“Politically linked firms are most common in countries famous for high levels of corruption.” Russia has led the way in this practice, in which firms with 80 percent of the country’s market capitalization were linked to public officials.\n\n\n“politically linked firms are most common in countries famous for high levels of corruption.” Russia has led the way in this practice, in which firms with 80 percent of the country’s market capitalization were linked to public officials. The comparable figure for the United States was less than 10 percent, partly due to American laws restricting this practice.\n\n\nWhat property rights mean to property owners is far less important than what they mean to the economy as a whole.\n\n\nFor example, various affluent communities in California, Virginia, and other places have required land to be sold only in lots of one acre or more per house, thereby pricing such land and homes beyond the reach of most people and thus neutralizing the greater aggregate purchasing power of less affluent people.\n\n\nAmong United Nations representatives who have diplomatic immunity from local laws in New York City, diplomats from various Middle East countries let numerous parking tickets go unpaid—246 by Kuwaiti diplomats—while not one diplomat from Denmark, Japan, or Israel had any unpaid parking tickets.\n\n\nWhen laws and policies make honesty increasingly costly, then government is, in effect, promoting dishonesty. Such dishonesty can then extend beyond the particular laws and policies in question to a more general habit of disobeying laws, to the detriment of the whole economy and society.\n\n\nIn the United States, some government agencies have been trying to restrict smoking while other government agencies have been subsidizing the growing of tobacco.\n\n\nIn Italy, for example, working men retire at an average age of 61 and those working in what are defined as “arduous” occupations—miners, bus drivers, and others—retire at age 57. The cost of this generosity consumes 15 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product, and Italy’s national debt in 2006 was 107 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\n\nPoliticians lack the courage to privatize the huge, loss-making public sector because they are afraid to lose the vote of organized labor. They resist dismantling subsidies for power, fertilizers, and water because they fear the crucial farm vote. They won’t touch food subsidies because of the massive poor vote. They will not remove thousands of inspectors in the state governments, who continuously harass private businesses, because they don’t want to alienate government servants’ vote bank. Meanwhile, these giveaways play havoc with state finances and add to our disgraceful fiscal deficit. Unless the deficit comes under control, the nation will not be more competitive; nor will the growth rate rise further to 8 and 9 percent, which is what is needed to create jobs and improve the chances of the majority of our people to actualize their capabilities in a reasonably short time.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Congress of the United States passed a farm subsidy bill—with bipartisan support—that has been estimated to cost the average American family more than $4,000 over the next decade in inflated food prices.\n\n\nFacts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. John Adams\n\n\n“That is more than three times the global total in foreign aid, making ‘remittances’ the main source of outside money flowing to the developing world.” Remittances are one-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product of Bosnia, 25 percent of the GDP of Honduras and 35 percent of the GDP of Laos.\n\n\nFour-fifths of the doughnut shops in California are owned by people of Cambodian ancestry and more than half the doctors in Britain were born outside of Britain.\n\n\nDuring the first Five-Year Plan, 40 percent of export earnings came from grain shipments. In 1931 one third of the machinery and equipment imported in the world was purchased by the U.S.S.R. Of all the equipment put into operation in Soviet factories during this period, 80 to 85 percent was purchased from the West.\n\n\nProtectionism is never about “saving jobs,” but about saving specific jobs of politically useful groups.\n\n\nFor example, whole sectors of the Ugandan economy collapsed after 50,000 Indians and Pakistanis were forced to leave the country in the 1970s.\n\n\nDuring the days of the Soviet Union, that country’s only airline, Aeroflot, became notorious for bad service and rudeness to passengers. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a new privately financed airline began to have great success, in part because its passengers appreciated being treated like human beings for a change. The management of the new airline declared that its employment policy was that it would not hire anyone who had ever worked for Aeroflot.\n\n\nBeware the people who moralize about great issues; moralizing is easier than facing hard facts. John Corry\n\n\nPeople who deplore greed often show a disdain for wealth. Although a disdain for wealth may be admired, only those who already have a certain amount of wealth can afford to disdain any further pursuit of it. The hungry do not disdain food nor the homeless disdain shelter. Wealth means options and who would want fewer options?\n\n\nHere, as elsewhere, the prevention of competition is essential to exploitation.\n\n\nWhat Say’s Law, in its most basic sense, argued was that the production of output and the generation of real income for those producing that output were not processes independent of each other.\n\n\nWe shall not grow wiser before we learn that much that we have done was very foolish.

It is a classic Austrian school of Economics type of book, and contains the usual arguments from that school. It uses 200 pages to conclude that you should not tamper with it.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked it well enough that I am partially inclined to the school of Austrian economics, with some degree of moderation in relation to their more “enthusiastic” notions. But all in all, it is a good book. When you tamper with a system, it will behave unexpectedly.\nThe central tenet of the book is that economics, like most things in this world, is non-linear, and we, therefore, cannot hope to understand it fully. And only a fool thinks in linearities.\nI think people who would like a pure reminder of why interventions and political meddling in the economy are destructive should read it.\nI am getting increasingly convinced that you need to understand chaos and non-linear theories to understand the world. It is such an important concept, and I don’t know if there are any more critical drivers in the world today.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nEconomics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident.\n\n\nThe bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond.\n\n\nDoesn’t the fellow who gets drunk know that he will wake up next morning with a ghastly stomach and a horrible head? Doesn’t the dipsomaniac know that he is ruining his liver and shortening his life? Doesn’t the Don Juan know that he is letting himself in for every sort of risk, from blackmail to disease?\n\n\nIt confuses need with demand. The more war destroys, the more it impoverishes, and the greater is the postwar need. Indubitably. But need is not demand.\n\n\nEverything we get, outside of the free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for. The world is full of so-called economists who in turn are full of schemes for getting something for nothing.\n\n\nThere is a strange idea abroad, held by all monetary cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. Credit, on the contrary, is something a man already has. He has it, perhaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it.\n\n\nThus private lenders (except the relatively small proportion that have got their funds through inheritance) are rigidly selected by a process of survival of the fittest. The government lenders, on the other hand, are either those who have passed civil service examinations, and know how to answer hypothetical questions hypothetically, or they are those who can give the most plausible reasons for making loans and the most plausible explanations of why it wasn’t their fault that the loans failed.\n\n\nIn Houston, Texas, master plumbers and the plumbing union agreed that piping prefabricated for installation would be installed by the union only if the thread were cut off one end of the pipe and new thread were cut at the job site.\n\n\nVarious locals of the painters’ union imposed restrictions on the use of spray-guns, restrictions in many cases designed merely to make work by requiring the slower process of applying paint with a brush.\n\n\nA local of the teamsters’ union required that every truck entering the New York metropolitan area have a local driver in addition to the driver already employed.\n\n\nThe economic goal of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest results with the least effort. The whole economic progress of mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor.\n\n\nHitler provided full employment with a huge armament program. The war provided full employment for every nation involved. The slave labor in Germany had full employment.\n\n\nWages and employment are discussed as if they had no relation to productivity and output\n\n\nTo save the coal industry Congress passed the Guffey Act, under which the owners of coal mines were not only permitted, but compelled, to conspire together not to sell below certain minimum prices fixed by the government. Though Congress had started out to fix “the” price of coal, the government soon found itself (because of different sizes, thousands of mines, and shipments to thousands of different destinations by rail, truck, ship and barge) fixing 350, separate prices for coal! One effect of this attempt to keep coal prices above the competitive market level was to accelerate the tendency toward the substitution by consumers of other sources of power or heat—such as oil, natural gas and hydro-electric energy.\n\n\nBut the central error, as we have hinted, comes from looking at only one industry, or even at several industries in turn, as if each of them existed in isolation. Each of them in fact exists in relation to all the others, and every important decision made in it is affected by and affects the decisions made in all the others.\n\n\nElementary illustrations like this are sometimes ridiculed as “Crusoe economics.” Unfortunately, they are ridiculed most by those who most need them, who fail to understand the particular principle illustrated even in this simple form, or who lose track of that principle completely when they come to examine the bewildering complications of a great modern economic society.\n\n\nBut wartime price-fixing, wise or not, is in almost all countries continued for at least long periods after the war is over, when the original excuse for starting it has disappeared.\n\n\n“A power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.”\n\n\nFor as Alexander Hamilton pointed out in the Federalist papers a century and a half ago, “A power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.”\n\n\nIt was a common story from many European countries that people were able to get enough to stay alive only by patronizing the black market. In some countries the black market kept growing at the expense of the legally recognized fixed-price market until the former became, in effect, the market.\n\n\nOne of these is the idea that labor is being “underpaid” generally. This would be analogous to the notion that in a free market prices in general are chronically too low.\n\n\nThe belief that they do so rests on a series of delusions. One of these is the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc, which sees the enormous rise in wages in the last half century, due principally to the growth of capital investment and to scientific and technological advance, and ascribes it to the unions because the unions were also growing during this period. But the error most responsible for the delusion is that of considering merely what a rise of wages brought about by union demands means in the short run for the particular workers who retain their jobs, while failing to trace the effects of this advance on employment, production and the living costs of all workers, including those who forced the increase.\n\n\nOne of the greatest dangers to production today comes from government price-fixing policies. Not only do these policies put one item after another out of production by leaving no incentive to make it, but their long-run effect is to prevent a balance of production in accordance with the actual demands of consumers.\n\n\nWhat inflation really does is to change the relationships of prices and costs. The most important change it is designed to bring about is to raise commodity prices in relation to wage rates, and so to restore business profits, and encourage a resumption of output at the points where idle resources exist, by restoring a workable relationship between prices and costs of production.\n\n\nLike every other tax, inflation acts to determine the individual and business policies we are all forced to follow. It discourages all prudence and thrift. It encourages squandering, gambling, reckless waste of all kinds. It often makes it more profitable to speculate than to produce. It tears apart the whole fabric of stable economic relationships. Its inexcusable injustices drive men toward desperate remedies. It plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably in bitter disillusion and collapse.\n\n\nFrom time immemorial proverbial wisdom has taught the virtues of saving, and warned against the consequences of prodigality and waste. This proverbial wisdom has reflected the common ethical as well as the merely prudential judgments of mankind. But there have always been squanderers, and there have apparently always been theorists to rationalize their squandering.\n\n\nEconomics, as we have now seen again and again, is a science of recognizing secondary consequences. It is also a science of seeing general consequences. It is the science of tracing the effects of some proposed or existing policy not only on some special interest in the short run, but on the general interest in the long run.\n\n\nOne can say of it what Santayana says of logic (and what could be equally well said of mathematics), that it “traces the radiation of truth,” so that “when one term of a logical system is known to describe a fact, the whole system attaching to that term becomes, as it were, incandescent.”\n\n\n“What is prudence in the conduct of every private family,” said Adam Smith’s strong common sense in reply to the sophists of his time, “can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/Finance/The-Quants":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/Finance/The-Quants","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Economics/Finance/The Quants.md","title":"The Quants","links":[],"tags":["books","economics","mathematics","finance","quantitative-analysis","machine-learning","anti-fragile","black-swan","game-theory"],"content":"The Quants\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis is a history book of people who revolutionized finance with math, game theory, and computers to model how the market work. However, the real world is not a model, and quants are also humans, as the financial crisis showed.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a book about the major players and the history of quantitative finance from the focal point of the major players. It was interesting, and i liked it as some sort of history book.\nIt was an interesting story, but i did not learn that much about the quantitative models outside of the shallowest one-liners.\nI did think the random walk vs. chaos theory models of the market was quite intersting.\nHow I Discovered It\nOn a fateful journey of N.N. Taleb´s Twitter timeline.\nWho Should Read It?\nIts a bit of a niche book, so only people with a history of the finance world.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nNot much, more interested in learning about chaos and non-linearities, as it is important for me to understand everything about it.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe Truth was a universal secret about the way the market worked that could only be discovered through mathematics.\n\n\n“The Great Moderation,” the speech told of a bold new economic era in which volatility—the jarring jolts and spasms that wreaked havoc on people’s lives and their pocketbooks—was permanently eradicated. One of the primary forces behind this economic Shangri-la, he said, was an “increased depth and sophistication of financial markets.”\n\n\nThe law of entropy essentially means everything in the universe will eventually turn into a homogenous, undifferentiated goop.\n\n\nThe future movement of a stock—a variable known to quants as volatility—is random, and therefore quantifiable.\n\n\nThe letter contained a draft of a paper that Black had written with another Chicago economist, Myron Scholes, about a formula for pricing stock options. It would become one of the most famous papers in the history of finance, though few people, including its authors, had any idea how important it would be.\n\n\nJust as Einstein’s discovery of relativity theory in 1905 would lead to a new way of understanding the universe, as well as the creation of the atomic bomb, the Black-Scholes formula dramatically altered the way people would view the vast world of money and investing.\n\n\nLike Thorp’s methodology for pricing warrants, an essential component of the Black-Scholes formula was the assumption that stocks moved in a random walk. Stocks, in other words, are assumed to move in antlike zigzag patterns just like the pollen particles observed by Brown in 1827.\n\n\nOn April 26, 1973, one month before the Black-Scholes paper appeared in print, the Chicago Board Options Exchange opened for business. And soon after, Texas Instruments introduced a handheld calculator that could price options using the Black-Scholes formula.\n\n\nHotshot trader named Gerry Bamberger who’d just abandoned a post at Morgan Stanley. Bamberger had created a brilliant stock trading strategy that came to be known as statistical arbitrage, or stat arb—one of the most powerful trading strategies ever devised, a nearly flawless moneymaking system that could post profits no matter what direction the market was moving.\n\n\nAs the meeting ended, APT’s traders and researchers sat fuming in their chairs. Shaw had crossed the line. Programmers weren’t supposed to trade, or even think about trading.\n\n\nAccording to their probability formula, published in 1995, the likelihood of the crash was a “27-standard-deviation event,” with a probability of 10 to the 160th power:\n\n\nMandelbrot proposed an alternative method to measure the erratic behavior of prices, one that borrows a mathematical technique devised by the French mathematician Paul Lévy, whom he’d studied under in Paris. Lévy investigated distributions in which a single sample radically changes the curve. The average of the heights of 1,000 people won’t change very much as a result of the height of the 1,001st person. But a so-called Lévy distribution can be thrown off by a single wild shift in the sample. Mandelbrot uses the example of a blindfolded archer: 1,000 shots may fall close to the target, but the 1,001st shot, by happenstance, may fall very wide of the mark, radically changing the overall distribution.\n\n\nStocks didn’t move in the tiny incremental ticks predicted by Brownian motion and the random walk theory. They leapt around like Mexican jumping beans.\n\n\nThe joke around Meyer’s office was that they used the law firm of Cookie &amp; Cutter to launch Griffin’s fund. It would eventually be called Citadel Investment Group, a name designed to evoke the image of high ramparts that could withstand the most awesome financial onslaughts imaginable.\n\n\nDuring his summer vacation in 1987, between his freshman and sophomore years, he frequently visited a friend who worked at the First National Bank of Palm Beach. One day, he was describing his ideas about convertible bonds and hedging. A retiree named Saul Golkin happened to step into the office. After listening to Griffin’s spiel for twenty minutes, Golkin said, “I’ve got to run to lunch, I’m in for fifty.” At first, Griffin didn’t understand, until his friend explained that Golkin had just forked over fifty grand to the young whiz kid from Harvard.\n\n\nGriffin started trading, and calling everyone on Wall Street who would speak with him. A typical reaction: “You’re running two hundred grand out of your dorm room? Don’t ever call me again.” Slam.\n\n\nGriffin set up shop in Chicago in late 1989 with his $1 million in play dough, and was quickly making money hand over fist trading convertibles with his handcrafted software program. In his first year of trading, Griffin posted a whopping 70 percent return. Impressed, Meyer decided to help Griffin launch his own fund. He thought about other funds with similar strategies, and that’s when Ed Thorp came to mind.\n\n\nBefore the interview, Muller made a pit stop in the men’s bathroom and was horrified by what he saw: a cigarette butt. A compulsive neat freak and health nut, Muller despised cigarettes. The butt was nearly a deal killer. He thought about canceling the interview. There was simply no way he would work in an office where people smoked.\n\n\nBy 1985, BARRA was the West Coast axis mundi of the quant universe.\n\n\nHe noticed that just as patients’ reactions to drugs differed, stocks exhibited strange, seemingly inexplicable behavior over time. There must be a logical way to find order beneath the chaos, he thought.\n\n\nThe professor, Eugene Fama, had been teaching at the University of Chicago since the early 1960s. Now, in September 1989, he was universally acknowledged as one of the brightest thinkers about financial markets and economics on the planet.\n\n\n“There are a number of consequences to market efficiency,” Fama said, facing the classroom. “One of the most important is that it’s\n\n\n“There are a number of consequences to market efficiency,” Fama said, facing the classroom. “One of the most important is that it’s statistically impossible to know where the market is going next. This is known as the random walk theory, which means that the future course of the market is like a coin toss.\n\n\n“The mathematical expectation of the speculator is zero.”\n\n\nAnother acolyte was Burton Malkiel, who went on to write A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\n\n\nIn the financial planning community, so-called Monte Carlo simulations, which can forecast everyday investors’ portfolio growth over time, used the idea that the market moves according to a random walk. Thus, an annual gain or loss of 5 percent a year is far more likely, since it falls near the center of the bell curve. A gain or loss of 50 percent, such as the stock market crash seen in the credit crisis of 2008 (or the 23 percent single-day plunge seen on Black Monday, for that matter) was so unlikely as to be a virtual impossibility—in the models, at least.\n\n\nThe most important element in determining a stock’s potential future return is its beta, a measure of how volatile the stock is compared with the rest of the market. And according to CAPM, the riskier the stock, the higher the potential reward.\n\n\nSuch a finding was nothing short of lobbing a blazing Molotov cocktail into the most sacred tent of modern portfolio theory. Decades of research were flat-out wrong, the two professors alleged. Perhaps even more surprising were Fama and French’s findings about the market forces that did, in fact, drive stock returns. They found two factors that determined how well a stock performed during their sample period for 1963 to 1990: value and size.\n\n\nAsness knew that momentum was a direct challenge to Fama, and he expected a fight. He cleared his throat. “My paper is going to be pro-momentum,” he said with a wince. Fama rubbed his cheek and nodded. Several seconds passed. He looked up at Asness, his massive forehead wrinkled in concentration. “If it’s in the data,” he said, “write the paper.” Asness was stunned and elated. Fama’s openness to whatever the data showed was a remarkable display of intellectual honesty, he felt.\n\n\nAccording to Soros: “The increasing skill in measuring risk and modeling risk led to the neglect of uncertainty at LTCM, and the result is you could use a lot more leverage than you should if you recognize uncertainty. LTCM used leverage far above what should have been the case. They didn’t recognize that the model is flawed and it neglected this thick tail in the bell curve.”\n\n\nRenaissance’s flagship Medallion fund, launched in the late 1980s, is considered by many to be the most successful hedge fund in the world.\n\n\nA Markov process, named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, models a sequence of events in a system that have no direct relation to one another.\n\n\nMercer, meanwhile, was simply known as the “big gun” at Renaissance. When a thorny problem cropped up that required focused attention, the firm would “just aim Bob at it and fire,” said a former employee.\n\n\nElsesser was one of the first to hit the road, moving on to study gender issues in the workplace at UCLA. She’d grown sick of Morgan’s Big Swinging Dick, macho culture, even though she was relatively isolated from the worst behavior under PDT’s protective bubble. Traders often treated her as if she were Muller’s secretary. One time soon after they’d launched PDT, Elsesser was trading futures contracts electronically. A man walked into PDT’s office, stared at Elsesser, looked around, left. He came again, looked, and left. The next time he came, looking around in confusion, scratching his crotch, Elsesser finally asked, “Can I help you?” “They keep telling me some quant trader is in here trading futures and I keep telling them there’s nobody back here.” After a furious pause, Elsesser said, “That’s me.” The guy stood staring at her slack-jawed, then left again without saying a word.\n\n\nBlack was eventually brought to the firm’s options desk to meet the head of trading. “So you’re Fischer Black,” the trader said, reaching out a hand to greet the legend. “Nice to meet you. Let me tell you something: you don’t know shit about options.” Welcome to Wall Street, Mr. Black.\n\n\nAs Asness went to meet the firm’s notoriously prickly and long-jawed COO, he thought back to the day he’d gone to tell Fama about his research on momentum. Asness respected Fama far more than Paulson, whom he barely knew. So why was he so nervous? The presentation involved, among other things, the various markets Global Alpha traded in. Asness rattled off a string of regions and countries: North America, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Japan. “We trade in all of the countries in the EAFE index,” Asness added. Paulson had been silent throughout the presentation. So he shocked Asness when he suddenly blurted out, “Hold it.” Asness froze. “How many countries are in that index?” “Well,” Asness said, “it comprises Europe, Australasia, the Far East—” “That’s not what I asked,” Paulson said curtly. “How many countries?” “I believe twenty-one,” Asness said. “Name ’em.” Asness looked at Paulson in shock. Name them? Is this guy screwing with me? Paulson wasn’t laughing. Asness swallowed hard and started to tick off the names. France, Germany, Denmark, Australia, Japan, Singapore … He listed every country in the EAFE index. His broad forehead had sprouted a dew of sweat. Paulson sat there coolly watching Asness with his steely eyes, clenching his massive mandible. There was an awkward silence. “That’s eighteen,” Paulsen said. He’d been counting the names. And Asness had come up short—or so Paulson was implying. There was little Asness could say. He fumbled through the rest of the presentation and left in confusion. Great way to show your appreciation for my hard work, he thought.\n\n\nIn November 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which had cleaved the investment banking and commercial banking industry in two—separating the risk-taking side of banks from the deposit side—was repealed.\n\n\nPeople who know Weinstein say his name is on more than one Vegas casino’s list of players banned for card counting.\n\n\n“There is no free lunch,” Taleb boomed in his thick Levant accent, his forefinger wagging in Muller’s face. “If ten thousand people flip a coin, after ten flips the odds are there will be someone who has turned up heads every time. People will hail this man as a genius, with a natural ability to flip heads. Some idiots will actually give him money. This is exactly what happened to LTCM. But it’s obvious that LTCM didn’t know shit about risk control. They were all charlatans.”\n\n\nBrown got sick of seeing the same rich kids he’d suckered at Harvard lord it over the quants in trading-floor games such as Liar’s Poker. That’s when he decided to bust up Liar’s Poker with quant wizardry.\n\n\nAs Ranieri once said, “Mortgages are math.”\n\n\nLi often discussed the problem with colleagues from academia who were experts in an actuarial science called survival analysis. One concept they studied was the fact that after the death of a spouse, people tend to die sooner than their demographic peers. In other words, they were measuring correlations between the deaths of spouses.\n\n\n“The Gaussian copula was the Black-Scholes for credit derivates,” said Michel Crouhy, Li’s boss at CIBC in the 1990s.\n\n\nThe Gaussian copula was, in hindsight, a disaster. The simplicity of the model hypnotized traders into thinking that it was a reflection of reality. In fact, the model was a jury-rigged formula based on the irrationally exuberant, self-reinforcing, and ultimately false wisdom of the crowd that assigned make-believe prices to an incredibly complex product. For a while it worked, and everyone was using it. But when the slightest bit of volatility hit in early 2007, the whole edifice fell apart.\n\n\nMagnetar’s trade was ingenious, and possibly diabolical. It would hold the riskiest slices of CDOs, known as the “equity”—those most vulnerable to defaults. But it also was buying protection on less-risky slices higher up the stack of the CDO’s structure, essentially betting on a wave of defaults. The roughly 20 percent yield on the equity slices provided the cash to purchase the less-risky slices. If the equity imploded, as it did, the losses would mean little if the higher-quality slices also saw significant losses, which they did.\n\n\nThe SEC complied. It also decided to rely on the banks’ own quantitative models to determine how risky their investments were. In essence, in a move that would come to haunt not just the agency but the entire economy, the SEC outsourced oversight of the nation’s largest financial firms to the banks’ quants.\n\n\nAll the bad news made it clear that many CDOs were worth far less than most had thought. The losses proved jaw-droppingly large. Later that year, Morgan took a loss of $7.8 billion, much of it from Hubler’s desk.\n\n\nCitadel, AQR, and Saba believed they were the smart guys in the room and had either hedged against losses or were on the right side of the trade and were poised to cash in.\n\n\nMargin call: two of the most frightening words in finance. Investors often borrow money from a prime broker to buy an asset, say a boatload of subprime mortgages. They do this through margin accounts. When the value of the asset declines, the prime broker calls up the investor and asks for additional cash in the margin account. If the investor doesn’t have the cash, he needs to sell something to raise it, some liquid holding that he can get rid of quickly.\n\n\nThe losses in Medallion, however, were the most perplexing. Simons had never seen anything like it. Medallion’s superfast trading strategy, which acts as a liquidity provider for the rest of the market, was buying up the assets from quant funds that were frantically trying to exit positions. Medallion’s models predicted that the positions would move back into equilibrium. But the snapback didn’t happen. The positions kept declining. There was no equilibrium. Medallion kept buying, until its portfolio was a near mirror image of the funds that were in a massive deleveraging. It was a recipe for disaster. The\n\n\nPissed-off plain-vanilla investors vented their rage on the quants as they saw their portfolios unravel. “You couldn’t get a date in high school and now you’re ruining my month,” was one sneer Muller heard.\n\n\nThe worst fear of quants such as Asness was that their Chicago School guru, Eugene Fama, had been right all along: the market is efficient, brutally so. Long used to gobbling up the short-term inefficiencies like ravenous piranhas, they’d had a big chunk taken out of their own flesh by forces they could neither understand nor control.\n\n\nDick Fuld was putting on a classic performance. The Lehman Brothers CEO, known as the “Gorilla” for his heavy-browed Cro-Magnon glare, monosyllabic grunts, and fiery rampages, had been ranting for more than a half hour to a roomful of managing directors. Fuld screamed. Jumped up and down. Shook his fists in defiance. It was June 2008. Lehman’s stock had been getting hammered all year as investors fretted about the firm’s shaky balance sheet.\n\n\nSomeone raised a hand. “We hear everything you’re saying, Dick. But talk is cheap. Acting is louder than words. When are you going to buy a million shares?” Fuld didn’t miss a beat. “When Kathy sells some art.” Fuld was referring to his wife, Kathy Fuld, known for her expensive art collection. Was he joking? Some wondered. Fuld wasn’t laughing\n\n\nSomeone raised a hand. “We hear everything you’re saying, Dick. But talk is cheap. Acting is louder than words. When are you going to buy a million shares?” Fuld didn’t miss a beat. “When Kathy sells some art.” Fuld was referring to his wife, Kathy Fuld, known for her expensive art collection. Was he joking? Some wondered. Fuld wasn’t laughing. There was the classic furrowed brow. It was a moment when some of Lehman’s top lieutenants started to wonder in earnest whether Lehman was in fact doomed. Their CEO seemed detached from reality. When Kathy sells some art?\n\n\nFor more than a year, Greenspan had argued time and again that he wasn’t to blame for the meltdown. Several weeks earlier, President George W. Bush had signed a $700 billion government bailout plan for a financial industry devastated by the housing market’s collapse. In July, Bush had delivered a blunt diagnosis for the troubles in the financial system. “Wall Street got drunk,” Bush said at a Republican fund-raiser in Houston. “It got drunk, and now it’s got a hangover. The question is, how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments?” The credit meltdown of late 2008 had shocked the world with its intensity. The fear spread far beyond Wall Street, triggering sharp downturns in global trade and battering the world’s economic engine. On Capitol Hill, the government’s finger-pointing machinery cranked up to full throttle. Among the first called to account: Greenspan. Greenspan, many in Congress believed, had been\n\n\nGreenspan’s confession was stunning. It marked a dramatic shift for the eighty-two-year-old banker who for so long had been hailed variously as the most powerful man on the planet and the wise central banker with a Midas touch. In a May 2005 speech he’d hailed the system he now doubted.\n\n\nAs Boaz Weinstein liked to say, it wasn’t rocket surgery.\n\n\nTo quants, unprecedented is perhaps the dirtiest word in the English language. Their models are by necessity backward-looking, based on decades of data about how markets operate in all kinds of conditions. When something is unprecedented, it falls outside the parameters of the models. In other words, the models don’t work anymore. It was as if a person flipping a coin a hundred times, expecting roughly half to turn up heads and the rest tails, experienced a dozen straight flips where the coin landed on its edge.\n\n\nMany of the rumors cropped up on a popular Wall Street blog called Dealbreaker.

Renaissance has a concept known as the “second forty hours.” Employees are each allotted forty hours to work on their assigned duties—programming, researching markets, building out the computer system. Then, during the second forty hours, they’re allowed to venture into nearly any area of the fund and experiment.\n\n\nCharismatic, extremely intelligent, easy to get along with, Simons had created a culture of extreme loyalty that encouraged an intense desire among its employees to succeed. The fact that very few Renaissance employees over the years had left the firm, compared to the river of talent flowing out of Citadel, was a testament to Simons’s leadership abilities.\n\n\nThe Ph.D.’s might know their sines from their cosines, but they often had little idea how to distinguish the fundamental realities behind why the market behaved as it did.\n\n\nThe truth is that there are no fundamental laws in finance.\n\n\nTo ensure that the quant-driven meltdown that began in August 2007 would never happen again, the two über-quants developed a “modelers’ Hippocratic Oath”: I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations. Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so. Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights. I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.\n\n\n“Beware of geeks bearing formulas,” Buffett warned.\n\n\n“People assume that if they use higher mathematics and computer models they’re doing the Lord’s work,” observed Buffett’s longtime partner, the cerebral Charlie Munger. “They’re usually doing the devil’s work.”\n\n\n“Mandelbrot, like Prime Minister Churchill before him, promises us not utopia but blood, sweat, toil, and tears,” he read. “If he is right, almost all of our statistical tools are obsolete.\n\n\nHis investing prowess is legendary, as is his physical stamina.

It goes through the five forces, how to understand business and companies. It shows how to understand the business and its advantages and disadvantages.\n🎨 Impressions\nThe five forces framework is important when it comes to understanding how a market and businesses behave\nThe missing middle phenomenon is important, where companies either tend to differentiate into high-end markets or low end markets slowly over time.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nVery early in his career, he went after the single biggest and most consequential question in business: Why are some companies more profitable than others?\n\n\nThe thing about classics, as Mark Twain once observed, is that they are often books “that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.”\n\n\n“The essence of strategy,” Porter often says, “is choosing what not to do.”\n\n\nPorter’s prescription: aim to be unique, not best. Creating value, not beating rivals, is at the heart of competition.\n\n\nThe second part is attributable to the company’s relative position within its industry. Strategic positioning reflects choices a company makes about the kind of value it will create and how that value will be created. Here, competitive advantage and the value chain are the relevant frameworks.\n\n\nThe first part is attributable to the structure of the industry in which competition takes place.\n\n\nSTRATEGY IS ONE OF the most dangerous concepts in business. Why dangerous? Because while most managers agree that it is terrifically important, once you start paying attention to how the word is used you will soon be wondering whether it means anything at all.\n\n\nStrategy explains how an organization, faced with competition, will achieve superior performance.\n\n\nMichael Porter has a name for this syndrome. He calls it competition to be the best. It is, he will tell you, absolutely the wrong way to think about competition. If you start out with this flawed idea of how competition works, it will lead you inevitably to a flawed strategy. And that will lead to mediocre performance.\n\n\nIn the vast majority of businesses, there is simply no such thing as “the best.”\n\n\nThis, says Porter, is competitive convergence. Over time, rivals begin to look alike as one difference after another erodes. Customers are left with nothing but price as the basis for their choices.\n\n\nCompanies only have to be “big enough,” which rarely means they have to dominate. Often “big enough” is just 10 percent of the market. Yet companies under the influence of winner-takes-all thinking tend to pursue illusory scale advantages.\n\n\nWhen choice is limited, value is often destroyed.\n\n\nStrategic competition means choosing a path different from that of others.\n\n\nThe real point of competition is not to beat your rivals. It’s to earn profits.\n\n\nThe five forces framework zeroes in on the competition you face and gives you the baseline for measuring superior performance.\n\n\nBecause there are no coherent economic principles underlying SWOT, you end up with random lists of items under each of the four headings, depending on who is in the room and what issues are top of mind that morning.\n\n\nUnit Profit Margin = Price – Cost Costs include all of the resources used in competing, including the cost of capital. These are the resources that the industry transforms to create value. Prices reflect how customers value the industry’s offerings, what they are willing to pay as they weigh their alternatives.\n\n\nIf you have powerful buyers (that is, customers), they will use their clout to force prices down.\n\n\nPowerful buyers will force prices down or demand more value in the product, thus capturing more of the value for themselves.\n\n\nBoth industrial customers and consumers tend to be more price sensitive when what they’re buying is Undifferentiated Expensive relative to their other costs or income Inconsequential to their own performance A counterexample that includes all three of these conditions is the price insensitivity of makers of major motion pictures when they buy or rent production equipment.\n\n\nPowerful suppliers will charge higher prices or insist on more favorable terms, lowering industry profitability.\n\n\nDoctors and airline pilots, to cite two examples, have historically exercised tremendous bargaining power because their skills have been both essential and in short supply.\n\n\nFor decades, OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has fended off substitutes by carefully managing the price of oil to discourage investment in alternative forms of energy.\n\n\nSubstitutes—products or services that meet the same basic need as the industry’s product in a different way—put a cap on industry profitability.\n\n\nThe threat of entry dampens profitability in two ways. It caps prices, because higher industry prices would only make entry more attractive for newcomers. At the same time, incumbents typically have to spend more to satisfy their customers. This discourages new entrants by raising the hurdle they would have to clear in order to compete.\n\n\nEntry barriers protect an industry from newcomers who would add new capacity.\n\n\nDoes producing in larger volumes translate into lower unit costs? If there are economies of scale, at what volumes do they kick in? The numbers matter.\n\n\nWhen rivalry among the current competitors is more intense, profitability will be lower. Incumbents will compete away the value they create by passing it on to buyers in lower prices or dissipating it in higher costs of competing.\n\n\nIf rivalry is intense, companies compete away the value they create, passing it on to buyers in lower prices or dissipating it in higher costs of competing.\n\n\nPrice competition, Porter warns, is the most damaging form of rivalry. The more rivalry is based on price, the more you are engaged in competing to be the best.\n\n\nThe five forces framework applies in all industries for the simple reason that it encompasses relationships fundamental to all commerce.\n\n\nIt matters that you grasp the deeper point: there are a limited number of structural forces at work in every industry that systematically impact profitability in a predictable direction.\n\n\nManagers often mistakenly assume that a high-growth industry will be an attractive one. But growth is no guarantee that the industry will be profitable.\n\n\nFinally, complements are sometimes proposed as a “sixth force.” Complements are products and services used together with an industry’s products—for example, computer hardware and software. Complements can affect the demand for an industry’s product (would you buy an electric car if you had no place to plug it in?), but like the other factors under discussion—growth, government, technology—they affect industry profitability through their impact on the five forces.\n\n\nCompetitive advantage is not about trouncing rivals, it’s about creating superior value.\n\n\nIf you have a real competitive advantage, it means that compared with rivals, you operate at a lower cost, command a premium price, or both.\n\n\nGrowth is another widely embraced goal, along with its sister goal, market share. Like ROS, these fail to account for the capital required to compete in the industry.\n\n\nIn industrial markets, value to the customer (which Porter calls buyer value) can usually be quantified and described in economic terms. A manufacturer might pay more for a piece of machinery because, compared with lower-priced alternatives, it will produce offsetting labor costs that exceed the higher price.\n\n\nI once calculated, for example, that consumers were effectively paying well over $100 an hour for the unskilled labor involved in grating cheese.\n\n\nStrategy choices aim to shift relative price or relative cost in a company’s favor.\n\n\nThe sequence of activities your company performs to design, produce, sell, deliver, and support its products is called the value chain. In turn, your value chain is part of a larger value system.\n\n\nStart by laying out the industry value chain. Every established industry has one or more dominant approaches. These reflect the scope and sequence of activities that most of the companies in that industry perform, and this is as true for nonprofits as for any business.\n\n\nYou begin to see each activity not just as a cost, but as a step that has to add some increment of value to the finished product or service.\n\n\nPorter uses the phrase operational effectiveness (OE) to refer to a company’s ability to perform similar activities better than rivals. Most managers use the term “best practice” or “execution.” Whichever term you prefer, we are talking about a multitude of practices that allow a company to get more out of the resources it uses. The important thing is not to confuse OE with strategy.\n\n\n*In this section of chapters, we’ll cover five tests every good strategy must pass:\n\nA distinctive value proposition\nA tailored value chain\nTrade-offs different from rivals\nFit across value chain\nContinuity over time\n\n\n\n*Porter defines the value proposition as the answer to three fundamental questions:\n\nWhich customers are you going to serve?\nWhich needs are you going to meet?\nWhat relative price will provide acceptable value for customers and acceptable profitability for the company?\n\n\n\nThe value proposition is the element of strategy that looks outward at customers, at the demand side of the business. The value chain focuses internally on operations. Strategy is fundamentally integrative, bringing the demand and supply sides together.\n\n\nThe Enterprise value proposition is based on a simple insight: renting a car meets different needs at different times.\n\n\nEarly in his career, Porter identified a set of generic strategies—focus, differentiation, and cost leadership—that quickly became one of the most widely used tools for thinking about key strategic choices.\n\n\nFocus refers to the breadth or narrowness of the customers and needs a company serves. Differentiation allows a company to command a premium price. Cost leadership allows it to compete by offering a low relative price.\n\n\nAt the same time, Porter described a common strategic mistake, which came to be known as getting stuck in the middle. This happens when a company tries to be all things to all customers and is outflanked by cost leaders on one side, who meet “just enough” of their customers’ needs, and by differentiators on the other side, who do a better job of satisfying customers who “want more” (of some particular attribute they value).\n\n\nEnterprise’s strategic insight was that its particular value proposition would require a completely different value chain from a Hertz or an Avis.\n\n\nChoices in the value proposition that limit what a company will do are essential to strategy because they create the opportunity to tailor activities in a way that best delivers that kind of value.\n\n\nTo establish a competitive advantage, a company must deliver its distinctive value through a distinctive value chain. It must perform different activities than rivals or perform similar activities in different ways.\n\n\n“Strategic competition,” Porter writes, “can be thought of as the process of perceiving new positions that woo customers from established positions or draw new customers into the market.”\n\n\nPorter’s first two tests of strategy: a unique value proposition and the tailored value chain required to deliver it.\n\n\nIf there is one important takeaway message, it is that strategy requires choice. Competitive advantage depends on making choices that are different from those of rivals, on making trade-offs. This is Porter’s third test. Trade-offs play such a critical role that it’s no exaggeration to call them strategy’s linchpin. They hold a strategy together as they contribute to both creating and sustaining competitive advantage.\n\n\nTrade-offs are the strategic equivalent of a fork in the road. If you take one path, you cannot simultaneously take the other.\n\n\nAn intriguing recent study has found a so-called IKEA effect: that self-assembly actually raises, not lowers, the price consumers would be willing to pay.\n\n\nIf you have a strategy, you should be able to link it directly to your P&amp;L.\n\n\nPorter calls what McDonald’s tried to do straddling, and it is the most common form of competitive imitation. The straddler, as the word implies, tries to match the benefits of the successful position while at the same time maintaining its existing position.\n\n\nBritish Airways took this lesson to heart: if you’re going to occupy two distinct positions in the same business, the only way to bypass the trade-offs is to create a separate organization with the freedom to choose its own, tailored value chain. BA’s experience shows that even when you do that, it is still a very hard act to pull off.\n\n\nAfter racking up somewhat-higher-than-expected losses, BA decided that running a low-cost airline was inconsistent with its positioning as a premium carrier. It sold Go to private equity firm 3i. Free from BA, Go launched an aggressive advertising campaign explicitly targeting BA customers. Only a year later, 3i was able to sell a larger Go to low-cost rival EasyJet at four times the price it had paid for the company.\n\n\nTrade-offs are choices that make strategies sustainable because they are not easy to match or to neutralize.\n\n\nWhen you try to offer something for everyone, you tend to relax the trade-offs that underpin your competitive advantage.\n\n\nExecutives often resist making trade-offs for fear they will lose some customers. The irony is that unless they make trade-offs and deliberately choose not to serve all customers and needs, then they are unlikely to do a good job of serving any customers and needs.\n\n\nGood strategies depend on the connection among many things, on making interdependent choices.\n\n\nFit means that the value or cost of one activity is affected by the way other activities are performed.\n\n\nCommon mistake in strategy is to choose the same core competences as everyone else in your industry.\n\n\n“We got good ideas from corporate … Each idea would come, falter, and go, and in six months there would be another idea. After a while we stopped believing in the ideas.”\n\n\nIn 1850, Paul Julius Reuter found an ingenious way to speed the delivery of global financial information to market participants. His new technology was the carrier pigeon. The company Reuter founded survives to this day, although the pigeons gave way to a series of technological innovations, beginning with the telegraph and culminating in the Internet.\n\n\nIn Porter’s view, these so-called inflection points are relatively rare, and companies are more likely to pull away from their strategies prematurely.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, leading change has become the hallmark of a great CEO. The principle of continuity reminds us, however, that not all change is good, that too much change can be bad, and that not all change requires a change in strategy.\n\n\nParadoxically, continuity of strategy actually improves an organization’s ability to adapt to changes and to innovate.\n\n\nThe deliberate and explicit setting of strategy is more important than ever during periods of change and uncertainty.\n\n\nWhat Porter asks of managers is both very simple and very hard. He asks, simply, that managers keep a clear line of sight between their decisions and their performance. But, he says, no cheating allowed—you must be precise and rigorous about it.\n\n\nTen Practical Implications Vying to be the best is an intuitive but self-destructive approach to competition. There is no honor in size or growth if those are profitless. Competition is about profits, not market share. Competitive advantage is not about beating rivals; it’s about creating unique value for customers. If you have a competitive advantage, it will show up on your P&amp;L. A distinctive value proposition is essential for strategy. But strategy is more than marketing. If your value proposition doesn’t require a specifically tailored value chain to deliver it, it will have no strategic relevance. Don’t feel you have to “delight” every possible customer out there. The sign of a good strategy is that it deliberately makes some customers unhappy. No strategy is meaningful unless it makes clear what the organization will not do. Making trade-offs is the linchpin that makes competitive advantage possible and sustainable. Don’t overestimate or underestimate the importance of good execution. It’s unlikely to be a source of a sustainable advantage, but without it even the most brilliant strategy will fail to produce superior performance. Good strategies depend on many choices, not one, and on the connections among them. A core competence alone will rarely produce a sustainable competitive advantage. Flexibility in the face of uncertainty may sound like a good idea, but it means that your organization will never stand for anything or become good at anything. Too much change can be just as disastrous for strategy as too little. Committing to a strategy does not require heroic predictions about the future. Making that commitment actually improves your ability to innovate and to adapt to turbulence.\n\n\nThe granddaddy of all mistakes is competing to be the best, going down the same path as everybody else and thinking that somehow you can achieve better results. This is a hard race to win. So many managers confuse operational effectiveness with strategy.\n\n\nAnother mistake is to overestimate strengths. There’s an inward-looking bias in many organizations. You might perceive customer service as a strong area. So that becomes the “strength” on which you attempt to build a strategy. But a real strength for strategy purposes has to be something the company can do better than any of its rivals.\n\n\nThe worst mistake—and the most common one—is not having a strategy at all. Most executives think they have a strategy when they really don’t.\n\n\nCapital markets have become toxic for strategy. The single-minded pursuit of shareholder value … has been enormously destructive for strategy and value creation.\n\n\nThe pressure to grow is among the greatest threats to strategy.\n\n\nMaking trade-offs often turns out to be harder for managers in nonprofits.\n\n\nStrategic planning often becomes a time-consuming ritual that really doesn’t support strategic thinking at all.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/Finansplaneten":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/Finansplaneten","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Economics/Finansplaneten.md","title":"Finansplaneten","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","economics","history","finance","money"],"content":"Finansplaneten\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the history of mankind as a function of finance and economics.

It is humiliating and destructive. They are not there for your handouts.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nFood subsidies are ubiquitous in the Middle East: Egypt spent $3.8 billion in food subsidies in 2008–2009 (2 percent of the GDP). Indonesia has the Rakshin Program, which distributes subsidized rice. Many states in India have a similar program: In Orissa, for example, the poor are entitled to 55 pounds of rice a month at about 4 rupees per pound, less than 20 percent of the market price.\n\n\nThe inability of the poor to feed themselves properly is also one of the most frequently cited root causes of a poverty trap. The intuition is powerful: The poor cannot afford to eat enough; this makes them less productive and keeps them poor.\n\n\nThe human body needs a certain number of calories just to survive. So when someone is very poor, all the food he or she can afford is barely enough to allow for going through the motions of living and perhaps earning the meager income that the individual originally used to buy that food. This is the situation Pak Solhin saw himself in when we met him: The food he got was barely enough for him to have the strength to catch some fish from the bank. As people get richer, they can buy more food. Once the basic metabolic needs of the body are taken care of, all that extra food goes into building strength, allowing people to produce much more than they need to eat merely to stay alive.\n\n\nMost people living with less than 99 cents a day do not seem to act as if they are starving. If they were, surely they would put every available penny into buying more calories. But they do not. In our eighteen-country data set on the lives of the poor, food represents from 36 to 79 percent of consumption among the rural extremely poor, and 53 to 74 percent among their urban counterparts.\n\n\nIt is not because all the rest is spent on other necessities: In Udaipur, for example, we find that the typical poor household could spend up to 30 percent more on food than it actually does if it completely cut expenditures on alcohol, tobacco, and festivals.\n\n\nWhen very poor people get a chance to spend a little bit more on food, they don’t put everything into getting more calories. Instead, they buy better-tasting, more expensive calories.\n\n\nThe real story of nutrition in India over the last quarter century is not that Indians are becoming fatter: It is that they are in fact eating less and less. Despite rapid economic growth, there has been a sustained decline in per capita calorie consumption; moreover, the consumption of all other nutrients except fat also appears to have declined among all groups, even the poorest.\n\n\nOne reason the poverty trap might not exist is that most people have enough to eat. At least in terms of food availability, today we live in a world that is capable of feeding every person that lives on the planet.\n\n\nStarvation exists in today’s world, but only as a result of the way the food gets shared among us. There is no absolute scarcity. It is true that if I eat a lot more than I need or, more plausibly, turn more of the corn into biofuels so that I can heat my pool, then there will be less for everybody else.\n\n\nHe found that the productivity of a worker on a farm increased at most by 4 percent when his calorie intake increased by 10 percent. Thus, even if people doubled their food consumption, their income would only increase by 40 percent.\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize Laureate and economic historian Robert Fogel calculated that in Europe during the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, food production did not provide enough calories to sustain a full working population. This could explain why there were large numbers of beggars—they were literally incapable of any work.\n\n\nIn Kenya, children who were given deworming pills in school for two years went to school longer and earned, as young adults, 20 percent more than children in comparable schools who received deworming for just one year: Worms contribute to anemia and general malnutrition, essentially because they compete with the child for nutrients.\n\n\nA review study by some of the best experts on nutrition leaves little doubt that proper nutrition in childhood has far-reaching implications. They conclude: “Undernourished children are more likely to become short adults, to have lower educational achievement, and to give birth to smaller infants. Undernutrition is also associated with lower economic status in adulthood.”\n\n\nThe poor often resist the wonderful plans we think up for them because they do not share our faith that those plans work, or work as well as we claim.\n\n\nThe decision to spend money on things other than food may not be due entirely to social pressure. We asked Oucha Mbarbk, a man we met in a remote village in Morocco, what he would do if he had more money. He said he would buy more food. Then we asked him what he would do if he had even more money. He said he would buy better tasting food. We were starting to feel very bad for him and his family, when we noticed a television, a parabolic antenna, and a DVD player in the room where we were sitting. We asked him why he had bought all these things if he felt the family did not have enough to eat. He laughed, and said, “Oh, but television is more important than food!”\n\n\nOnce a village agrees to work with Gram Vikas, the building work starts and continues for one to two years. Only after every single house has received its tap and toilet is the system turned on. In the meantime, Gram Vikas collects data every month on who has gone to the health center to get treated for malaria or diarrhea. We can thus directly observe what happens in a village as soon as the water starts flowing. The effects are remarkable: Almost overnight, and for years into the future, the number of severe diarrhea cases falls by one-half, and the number of malaria cases falls by one-third. The monthly cost of the system for each household, including maintenance, is 190 rupees, or $4 per household (in current USD), only 20 percent of what is conventionally assumed to be the cost of such a system.\n\n\nIn many of the countries in our eighteen-country data set, the poor spend a considerable amount of their own money on health care. The average extremely poor household spends up to 5 percent of its monthly budget on health in rural India, and 3 percent to 4 percent in Pakistan, Panama, and Nicaragua. In most countries, more than one-fourth of the households had made at least one visit to a health practitioner in the previous month. The poor also spend large amounts of money on single health events: Among the poor families in Udaipur, 8 percent of the households recorded total expenditures on health of more than 5,000 rupees ($228 USD PPP) in the previous month, ten times the monthly budget per capita for the average family, and some households (the top 1 percent spenders) spent up to twenty-six times the average monthly budget per capita.\n\n\nThe issue is therefore not how much the poor spend on health, but what the money is spent on, which is often expensive cures rather than cheap prevention.\n\n\nIn India, the local health posts are supposed to be open six days a week, six hours a day. But in Udaipur, we visited over 100 facilities once a week at some random time during working hours for a year. We found them closed 56 percent of the time. And in only 12 percent of the cases was this because the nurse was on duty somewhere else near the center. The rest of the time, she was simply absent. This rate of absence is similar elsewhere.\n\n\nThe overall sense we get from their study about health care in India, both public and private, is frightening. Das and Hammer describe it as the 3-3-3 rule: The median interaction lasts three minutes; the provider asks three questions and occasionally performs some examinations. The patient is then provided with three medicines (providers usually dispense medicine directly rather than writing prescriptions). Referrals are rare (fewer than 7 percent of the time); patients are given instructions only about half the time and only about one-third of doctors offer any guidance regarding follow-up. As if this is not bad enough, things are much worse in the public sector than in the private sector. Public providers spend about two minutes per patient on average. They ask fewer questions, and in most cases don’t touch the patient at all. Mostly, they just ask the patient for a diagnosis and then treat the patient’s self-diagnosis.\n\n\nGiven the very broad consensus that immunization saves lives (2 to 3 million people are estimated to die from vaccine-preventable diseases every year) and the low cost (for the villagers, it is free), this seems like something that would be a priority for every parent. The low immunization rates, it was widely held, must have been the result of the delinquency of the nurses. Mothers would just get tired of walking all the way there with a young child and not finding the nurse.\n\n\nMichael Kremer and his colleagues came up with one method: a (free) chlorine dispenser, called “one turn,” installed next to the village well, where everybody goes to get water, which delivers the right quantity of chlorine at one turn of a knob. This makes the chlorination of water as easy as possible, and because that leads many people to add chlorine every time they collect water, this is the cheapest way to prevent diarrhea among all the interventions for which there is evidence from randomized trials.\n\n\nSchools are available. In most countries, they are free, at least at the primary level. Most children are enrolled. And yet in the various surveys that we have conducted around the world, child absentee rates vary between 14 percent and 50 percent.\n\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals do not specify that children should learn anything in school, just that they should complete a basic cycle of education.\n\n\nIn Kenya, the Uwezo Survey, modeled on ASER, found that 27 percent of children in fifth grade could not read a simple paragraph in English, and 23 percent could not read in Kiswahili (the two languages of instruction in primary school). Thirty percent could not do basic division. In Pakistan, 80 percent of children in third grade could not read a first-grade-level paragraph.8\n\n\nDespite their sometimes dubious credentials, private schools often work better than public schools. The World Absenteeism Survey found that in India, private schools were more likely to be found in villages where the public schools were particularly bad. Furthermore, on average, the private-school teachers were 8 percentage points more likely to be in school on a given day than public-school teachers in the same village. Children who go to private school also perform better. In India in 2008, according to ASER, 47 percent of government-school students in fifth grade could not read at the second-grade level, compared to 32 percent of private-school students.\n\n\nThe lucky boy’s mother explained to us that he was the only intelligent child in the family. The willingness to use words like “stupid” and “intelligent” to refer to one’s own children, often in their presence, is entirely consistent with a worldview that puts a large premium on picking a winner (and in getting everyone else in the family to back the winner).\n\n\nIn Burkina Faso, a study found that adolescents were more likely to be enrolled in school when they scored high on a test of intelligence, but they were less likely to be enrolled in school when their siblings had scored high.\n\n\nThe problem is that there are no straightforward ways to identify talent, unless one is willing to spend a lot of time doing what the education system should have been doing: giving people enough chances to show what they are good at.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the pressure occasionally went much further. In Uttawar, a Muslim village near the capital city of Delhi, all male villagers were rounded up one night by the police, sent to the police stations on bogus charges, and sent from there to be sterilized.\n\n\n“Indira hatao, indiri bachao (Get rid of Indira and save your penis).”\n\n\nIn one of those ironic twists in which historians delight, it is not inconceivable that in the longer term, Sanjay Gandhi actually contributed to the faster growth of India’s population. Tainted by the emergency, family-planning policies in India retreated into the shadows and in the shadows they have remained—some states, such as Rajasthan, do continue to promote sterilization on a voluntary basis, but no one except the health bureaucracy seems to have any interest in it.\n\n\nThe standard message spells out a clear hierarchy of strategies: Abstain, Be faithful, use a Condom … or you Die (or in other words, ABCD). In schools, children are taught to avoid sex until marriage, and condoms are not discussed. For many years, this trend was encouraged by the U.S. government, which focused its AIDS prevention money on abstinence-only programs.\n\n\nA striking feature of HIV is that women from the ages of fifteen to nineteen are five times more likely to be infected than young men in the same cohort. This seems to be because young women have sex with older men, who have comparably high infection rates. The “sugar daddies” program simply informed students about what kind of people are more likely to be infected. Its effect was to sharply cut down sex with older men (the “sugar daddies”) but, also interestingly, to promote protected sex with boys their own age.\n\n\nOne reason the fertility transition takes time is that people other than the wife and husband have a say about it. Fertility is in part a social and a religious norm, and deviations from it do get punished (by ostracism, ridicule, or religious sanctions). Therefore, it matters what the community deems to be appropriate behavior.\n\n\nFor many parents, children are their economic futures: an insurance policy, a savings product, and some lottery tickets, all rolled into a convenient pint-size package.\n\n\nFor the sake of their models, economists often ignore the inconvenient fact that the family is not the same as just one person. We treat the family as one “unit,” assuming that the family makes decisions as if it were just one individual.\n\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, women and men traditionally grow different crops. Men grow coffee and cocoa, whereas women grow bananas, vegetables, and other staples. Different crops are affected differently by the weather: A particular rainfall pattern may result in a good year for the male crops and a bad year for the female crops. In a study with Udry, Esther found that in good “male” years, more is spent on alcohol, tobacco, and personal luxury items for men (such as traditional items of clothing). In good “female” years, more resources are spent on little indulgences for women but also on food purchases for the household. What is particularly odd about these results is that spouses do not seem to be “insuring” each other. Knowing that they will be together for a long time, the husband could gift his wives some extra goodies in a good male year in return for some extras when the weather goes the other way.\n\n\nAlthough many elderly people in the United States would prefer to spend more time with their children and grandchildren (at least if sitcoms are to be believed), the fact that they have the option of surviving on their own—thanks in part to Social Security and Medicare—may be very important for their dignity and their sense of self. It also means that they do not need to have lots of children in order to ensure that there will be someone to take care of them.\n\n\nThe most effective population policy might therefore be to make it unnecessary to have so many children (in particular, so many male children). Effective social safety nets (such as health insurance or old age pensions) or even the kind of financial development that enables people to profitably save for retirement could lead to a substantial reduction in fertility and perhaps also less discrimination against girls.\n\n\nRisk is a central fact of life for the poor, who often run small businesses or farms or work as casual laborers, with no assurance of regular employment.\n\n\nTheir problems started when a business acquaintance they trusted gave them a bad check worth 20 million rupiah ($3,750 USD PPP). They went to the police. Policemen demanded 2.5 million rupiah in bribes even to agree to start investigating; after they were paid, they did manage to arrest the defaulter. He ended up spending a week in prison before he was released, after promising to repay what he owed. After reimbursing 4 million rupiah to Ibu Tina (of which the police claimed another 2 million) and promising to repay the rest over time, he disappeared and has not been heard from since. Ibu Tina and her husband had paid 4.5 million rupiah in bribes to recoup 4 million.\n\n\nA friend of ours from the world of high finance always says that the poor are like hedge-fund managers—they live with huge amounts of risk. The only difference is in their levels of income. In fact, he grossly understates the case: No hedge-fund manager is liable for 100 percent of his losses, unlike almost every small business owner and small farmer. Moreover, the poor often have to raise all of the capital for their businesses, either out of the accumulated “wealth” of their families or by borrowing from somewhere, a circumstance most hedge-fund managers never have to face.\n\n\nBig agricultural disasters, such as the Bangladesh drought of 1974 (when wages fell by 50 percent in terms of purchasing power and, according to some estimates, up to 1 million people died) or food crises in Africa (such as the Niger 2005–2006 drought), naturally attract particular attention from the media, but even in “normal” years, agricultural incomes vary tremendously from year to year. In Bangladesh, in any normal year, agricultural wages could be up to 18 percent above or below their average levels. And the poorer the country, the greater this variability. For instance, agricultural wages in India are twenty-one times more variable than in the United States. This is no surprise: American farmers are insured, receive subsidies, and benefit from the standard social insurance programs; they don’t need to fire their workers or cut wages when they have a bad harvest.\n\n\nFor the poor, every year feels like being in the middle of a colossal financial crisis.\n\n\nHarder to focus, which in turn may make us less productive. In particular, there is a strong association between poverty and the level of cortisol produced by the body, an indicator of stress. And conversely, the cortisol levels go down when households receive some help. The children of the beneficiaries of PROGRESA, the Mexican cash transfer program, have, for example, been found to have significantly lower levels of cortisol than comparable children whose mothers did not benefit from the program.\n\n\nAll of these ways in which the poor cope with risk tend to be very costly. This has been well documented for agriculture: In India, poor farmers use farm inputs in a more conservative but less efficient way when they live in areas where rainfall is more erratic. Poor farmers’ profit rates go up by as much as 35 percent when they live in areas where the yearly rainfall pattern is very predictable. Furthermore, risk affects only the poor in this way: In the case of the richer farmers, there is no relationship between farm profit rates and variability in rainfall, presumably because they can afford a loss of harvest and therefore are willing to take risks.\n\n\nAnother strategy that poor farmers often adopt is to become someone’s share tenant, meaning that the landlord pays a part of the cost of farming and claims a part of the output. This limits the farmer’s risk exposure at the cost of incentives: Knowing that the landlord will take half (for example) of whatever comes out of the ground, the farmer has less reason to work very hard. A study in India showed that farmers put in 20 percent less of their own effort on land that they sharecrop compared to land where they are entitled to the entire crop.13 As a result, these plots are farmed less intensively and less efficiently.\n\n\nA study by Christopher Udry shows both the power and the limits of such informal insurance. Over an entire year that he spent in rural Nigeria, Udry got his fellow villagers to record every gift or informal loan that they gave to each other, as well as the terms under which they repaid those loans. He also asked them every month if something bad had happened to them. He found that at any point in time, the average family owed or was owed money by 2.5 other families. Furthermore, the terms of the loans were adjusted to reflect the situations of both the lender and the borrower. When the borrower suffered a shock, he would reimburse less (often less than the original loan amount), but when it was the lender who had hit a rough patch, the borrower would actually repay more than he owed. The dense network of mutual borrowing and lending did a lot to reduce the risk that any individual was facing. Nevertheless, there was some limit to what this informal solidarity could achieve. Families still suffered a drop in consumption when they experienced a shock, even when the total income of everyone in their network put together had not changed.\n\n\nHealth shocks, in particular, are very badly insured. In Indonesia, consumption drops 20 percent when a household member falls severely\n\n\nIn Chennai, India, when the typical fruit seller reimburses the wholesaler at night for the 1,000 rupees’ ($51 USD PPP) worth of vegetables she got in the morning, she gives him 1,046.9 rupees on average. This interest payment is 4.69 percent per day.\n\n\nThese very high interest rates were the call to action for the founders of microfinance. For instance, Padmaja Reddy, the CEO of Spandana, one of the largest microfinance institutions (MFI) in India, told us that she got the inspiration for starting Spandana after striking up a conversation with a ragpicker in the city of Guntur, in Andhra Pradesh. She realized that if only the ragpicker could come up with the funds to buy one cart, she could be in a position to buy “scores of carts” in just a few weeks with the money saved from not having to pay the daily rental fee. But the ragpicker did not have enough money to buy a cart. Why, Padmaja asked herself, is no one lending her the money to buy one cart? According to Padmaja, the ragpicker explained that the bank would not lend to someone like her.\n\n\nIn the survey we conducted in Udaipur, in rural India, about two-thirds of the poor had a loan. Of these, 23 percent were from a relative, 18 percent from a moneylender, 37 percent from a shopkeeper, and only 6.4 percent from a formal source.\n\n\nAs the French put it, “On ne prête qu’aux riches” (“One lends only to the rich”).\n\n\nEven when the bank manages to get its money back, things can backfire: Banks do not like headlines associating them with “farmer suicides.” And to cap it all off, when elections are around the corner, governments love to write off outstanding loans.\n\n\nGiven all this, it is no surprise that banks find it easier to stay away from lending to the poor altogether, leaving the field to moneylenders. However, although the moneylenders have an advantage in getting their money back, they have to pay a lot more for the money they lend out than the banks.\n\n\nThe typical MFI contract involves loans to a group of borrowers, who are liable for each other’s loans and hence have a reason to try to make sure that the others repay.\n\n\nLike the moneylender, MFIs threaten to cut off all future lending to anyone who defaults outright and do not hesitate to use their connections within village social networks to put pressure on recalcitrant borrowers. Unlike moneylenders, their official policy is never to use actual physical threats.\n\n\nWhen we compared the households in these two sets of neighborhoods, some fifteen to eighteen months after Spandana started lending, there was clear evidence that microfinance was working. People in the Spandana neighborhoods were more likely to have started a business and more likely to have purchased large durable goods, such as bicycles, refrigerators, or televisions. Households that did not start a new business were consuming more in these neighborhoods, but those who had started a new business were actually consuming less, tightening their belts to make the most of the new opportunity.\n\n\nThe fraction of families that started a new business over the fifteen-month period went up from about 5 percent to just over 7 percent—not nothing, but hardly a revolution. As economists, we were quite pleased with these results: The main objective of microfinance seemed to have been achieved. It was not miraculous, but it was working. There needed to be more studies to make sure that this was not some fluke, and it would be important to see how things panned out in the long run, but so far, so good. In our minds, microcredit has earned its rightful place as one of the key instruments in the fight against poverty.\n\n\nThe MFIs responded to the evidence from the two studies (ours, and another by Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman, with even more lukewarm results) with six anecdotes on successful borrowers. This was followed by an op-ed in the Seattle Times by Brigit Helms, CEO of Unitus, that simply declared, “These studies are giving the inaccurate impression that increasing access to basic financial services has no real benefit.”14 It was somewhat surprising to read, since our evidence shows, quite to the contrary, that microfinance is a useful financial product. But that apparently is not enough. Trapped by decades of overpromising, many of the leading players in the microfinance world have apparently decided they would rather rely on the power of denial than take stock, regroup, and admit that microfinance is only one of the possible arrows in the fight against poverty.\n\n\nThe crisis of fall 2010 in Andhra Pradesh was almost a repeat, on a grander scale, of the 2006 crisis. Once again, farmer suicides were used as an argument for politicians to attack the MFIs, and once again, repayments entirely stopped once the government stepped in. It brought some of the biggest microfinance institutions (SKS, Spandana, and Share) to the brink of bankruptcy. Such episodes suggest that MFIs might be right to focus on managing beliefs, and therefore it might make sense for them to insist on prioritizing repayment discipline over everything else. Opening the door to defaults, even as a way to encourage necessary risk taking, may lead to an unraveling of the social contract that allows them to keep repayment rates high and interest rates relatively low.\n\n\nThe necessary focus on repayment discipline implies that microfinance is not the natural or best way to finance entrepreneurs who want to go beyond micro-enterprises. For each successful entrepreneur in the Silicon Valley or elsewhere, many have had to fail. The microfinance model, as we saw, is simply not well designed to put large sums of money in the hands of people who might fail. This is not an accident, nor is this due to some shortcoming in the microcredit vision. It is the necessary by-product of the rules that have allowed microcredit to lend to a large number of poor people at low interest rates.\n\n\nNarayan Murthy and Nandan Nilekani, despite their degrees from the ultra-prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, could not get a loan to start the firm Infosys because the banker objected that the bank could see no inventory to lend against. Infosys today is one of the largest software firms in the world. It is hard not to assume that there are a lot more people like these three, but who just couldn’t make it because they didn’t get the right financing at the right time.\n\n\nIn India, the introduction of faster court action led to much faster loan recovery, larger loans, and lower interest rates. However, this is not a magic bullet, either. When the debt recovery tribunals were introduced, lending to the largest firms increased, but lending to the smaller firms actually went down.\n\n\nWe asked him what he did when he had already purchased fertilizer (but not yet used it) and someone got sick. Wasn’t he tempted to resell it at a loss? His answer was that he never found the need to resell the fertilizer. Instead, he tended to reevaluate the true urgency of any need when there was no money lying around. And if something really needed to be paid for, he would kill a chicken or work a bit harder as a bicycle taxi driver (a job he did on the side when he was not too busy with farming).\n\n\nAnother manifestation of time inconsistency is to buy what we want today (alcohol, sugary or fatty foods, trinkets) but to plan on spending money in more responsible ways tomorrow (school fees, bed nets, roof repairs). In other words, the things we take pride or pleasure in imagining buying in the future are not always what we end up buying today. Knowing that we will have one drink too many again tomorrow gives most of us no pleasure—indeed, it probably makes us unhappy—yet when tomorrow comes along many of us cannot resist it. Alcohol, in this sense, is a temptation good for many people, something that makes immediate claims on us without giving us anticipatory pleasure. In contrast, a television is probably not a temptation good: Many poor people plan and save for months or even years to buy one.\n\n\nAwareness of our problems thus does not necessarily mean that they get solved. It may just mean that we are able to perfectly anticipate where we will fail.\n\n\nSelf-control may also be more difficult for the poor for another reason: Decisions about how much should be saved are difficult decisions for anyone, rich and poor alike. These decisions require thinking about the future (a future probably unpleasant to contemplate, for many of the poor), carefully laying out a number of contingencies, negotiating with a spouse or a child. The richer we are, the more these decisions are made for us.\n\n\nWe saw no point in reminding her that this went diametrically against the view that we heard from so many people, that the worst thing about easy credit for the poor is precisely that it makes it too easy for them to indulge their momentary whims, but it was clearly on our minds when we started to look at the data, some eighteen months after the first round of loans.\n\n\nThe bigger point is that a little bit of hope and some reassurance and comfort can be a powerful incentive. It is easy for those of us who have enough, living a secure life, structured by goals that we can reasonably confidently aspire to achieve (that new sofa, the 50-inch flat screen, that second car) and institutions designed to help us get there (savings accounts, pension programs, home-equity loans) to assume, like the Victorians, that motivation and discipline are intrinsic. As a result, there are always worries about being overindulgent to the slothful poor. Our contention is that for the most part, the problem is the opposite: It is too hard to stay motivated when everything you want looks impossibly far away. Moving the goalposts closer may be just what the poor need to start running toward them.\n\n\nIf you have very little, use your ingenuity to create something out of nothing.\n\n\n“Give poor communities the opportunities, and get out of the way.”\n\n\nSo many have managed to be entrepreneurs in the face of so much adversity, and have made so much out of so little. There are, however, two troubling shadows in this otherwise sunny picture. First, while many of the poor operate businesses, they mainly operate tiny businesses. And second, these tiny businesses are, for the most part, making very little money.\n\n\nEconomists (for once, probably usefully) distinguish between the marginal return on a dollar and the overall return from a business. The marginal return on a dollar is the answer to the question “What would happen to your revenue net of all operating costs (but not interest costs) if you were to invest 1 less, or 1 more?”The marginal return is what is relevant when you ask whether you should cut your investment a little (or grow it a little): If investing 1 less allows you to borrow 1 less and therefore repay 4 cents less in principal and interest, you would want to do so if the marginal return is less than 4 percent and not otherwise. So when people borrow at a rate of interest of 4 percent a month, it must mean that their marginal return is at least 4 percent a month.\n\n\nThis is the paradox of the poor and their businesses: They are energetic and resourceful and manage to make a lot out of very little. But most of this energy is spent on businesses that are too small and utterly undifferentiated from the many others around them. As a result, their operators have no chance to earn a reasonable living. The creative sand-driers of Mumbai had spotted an opportunity to make a profitable use of the resources available to them: some free time and the sand on the beach. But what the businessman’s uncle had failed to point out was that, for all their ingenuity, the profits from this activity were almost surely negligible.\n\n\nThe average small business in the Hyderabad survey, we noted, would actually lose money if it were to pay even minimum wages.\n\n\nIf our diagnosis is correct, the reason that the poor do not grow their businesses is that, for most of them, it is too hard: They cannot borrow to cross the hump, and saving up to get there will take too long unless their businesses have extremely high overall returns.\n\n\nIt is only recently that men in the West have learned to at least pay lip service to the many things that their wife who “does not work” does for them; it would not be astonishing if their developing-country counterparts ascribed more leisure to their spouses than they actually enjoy. It\n\n\nEverywhere we have asked, the most common dream of the poor is that their children become government workers.\n\n\nIn Pakistan, for example, in urban areas, 74 percent of those who are employed and who live on 99 cents or less per day work for a weekly or monthly wage, but 90 percent of those earning 6 to 10 a day do. In rural areas, 44 percent of the very poor who are employed work for a regular wage, and 64 percent of the middle class do.\n\n\nMaquiladoras generally have the reputation of being exploitative and paying poor wages. However, for many women without a high school education, the establishment of the maquiladoras offers the prospect of a better job than the jobs in retail, food services, or transportation that would otherwise be their lot—the hourly wages are not much higher, but they work longer hours and with more regularity.\n\n\nSeveral examples of the effects of risk on household behavior: Poor families take preventive actions to limit risk even at the cost of higher levels of income. Here we see another consequence, possibly even deeper: A sense of stability may be necessary for people to be able to take the long view. It is possible that people who don’t envision substantial improvements in their future quality of life opt to stop trying and therefore end up staying where they are. You\n\n\nKaivan Munshi, for example, found that Mexican villagers migrate to cities where people from their village have already migrated, even if the original round of migration was purely accidental.\n\n\nMicrocredit and other ways to help tiny businesses still have an important role to play in the lives of the poor, because these tiny businesses will remain, perhaps for the foreseeable future, the only way many of the poor can manage to survive. But we are kidding ourselves if we think that they can pave the way for a mass exit from poverty.\n\n\nAcemoglu and Robinson define institutions as follows: “Economic institutions shape economic incentives, the incentives to become educated, to save and invest, to innovate and adopt new technologies, and so on. Political institutions determine the ability of citizens to control politicians.”\n\n\nThe argument in Acemoglu and Robinson’s book Why Nations Fail, which reflects a widely shared view among scholars of political economy, is that these (broad) institutions are the prime drivers of the success or failure of a society. Good economic institutions will encourage citizens to invest, accumulate, and develop new technologies, as a result of which society will prosper. Bad economic institutions will have the opposite effects. One problem is that rulers, who have the power to shape economic institutions, do not necessarily find it in their interest to allow their citizens to thrive and prosper.\n\n\nOur colleague Benjamin Olken hired teams of engineers to excavate a tiny bit of road in 600 or so villages to figure out how much material had actually gone into the road’s construction. The cost estimate was then compared with what was reported. Another team interviewed some of the people who were reported to have worked on the project about how much they had actually been paid. Theft was rife: 27 percent of the wages reported to have been paid had somehow vanished, and so had 20 percent of the materials. To make matters worse, the money was only one part of the waste. The roads that were built were still the same length (otherwise the theft would be too obvious) but the missing materials meant that they were built less well, and therefore more liable to be washed away by the next rains.\n\n\nIn an effort to fight corruption, government officials in charge of the program told the village leaders that the building programs would be audited, and the results would be made public. The government did not hire especially honest auditors—they worked within the existing system. Yet, Olken showed that the threat of audits reduced the theft of wages and materials by one-third, compared to the villages where audits were not conducted (the villages where audits were conducted were randomly selected).\n\n\n“Eve-teasing” (the expression that Indians use to describe harassing women in the streets),\n\n\nBrazil used to have a complex paper ballot. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list, then write in the name (or the number) of the candidate they wanted to vote for on their ballot. In a country where roughly one-fourth of adults are not functionally literate, this led to the de facto disenfranchisement of a large number of voters. In the average election, almost 25 percent of the votes were invalid and not counted.\n\n\nFurther studies elsewhere in India have made it clear that women leaders almost always make a difference.\n\n\nGovernments exist to a large extent to solve problems that markets cannot solve—we have already seen that in many instances government intervention is necessary precisely when, for some reason, the free market cannot do the job.\n\n\nAfter seeing a female pradhan in their village, villagers not only lost their prejudice against women politicians but even started thinking that their daughter might become one, too; teachers who are told that their job is simply to make sure that all the children can read can accomplish that task within the duration of a summer camp. Most important, the role of expectations means that success often feeds on itself. When a situation starts to improve, the improvement itself affects beliefs and behavior.\n\n\nIntestinal worms might be the last subject you want to bring up on a hot date, but kids in Kenya who were treated for their worms at school for two years, rather than one (at the cost of 1.36 USD PPP per child and per year, all included), earned 20 percent more as adults every year, meaning 3,269 USD PPP over a lifetime.\n\n\nWe became development economists because of our mothers, Nirmala Banerjee and Violaine Duflo. In their lives and their work they each constantly express an unwillingness to live with the injustice that they see in the world. We would have had to be deaf and blind to escape their influence.\n\n\nOur fathers, Dipak Banerjee and Michel Duflo, taught us the importance of getting the argument right. We do not always measure up to the exacting standard of precision they set for themselves, but we came to understand why it is the right standard.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/The-Capitalist-Manifesto":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Economics/The-Capitalist-Manifesto","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Economics/The Capitalist Manifesto.md","title":"The Capitalist Manifesto","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","Capitalism","economics","communism"],"content":"The Capitalist Manifesto\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a homage to the progress that capitalism has brought.

And God answered: now take that same onion, hold it out to her in the lake, let her take hold of it, and pull, and if you pull her out of the lake, she can go to paradise, but if the onion breaks, she can stay where she is. The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her: here, woman, he said, take hold of it and I’ll pull. And he began pulling carefully, and had almost pulled her all the way out, when other sinners in the lake saw her being pulled out and all began holding on to her so as to be pulled out with her. But the woman was wicked as wicked could be, and she began to kick them with her feet: ‘It’s me who’s getting pulled out, not you; it’s my onion, not yours.’ No sooner did she say it than the onion broke. And the woman fell back into the lake and is burning there to this day.

It does not authorize all actions. “Everything is permitted” does not mean that nothing is forbidden. The absurd merely confers an equivalence on the consequences of those actions.\n\n\nAll existence for a man turned away from the eternal is but a vast mime under the mask of the absurd.

Freedom all look the same, but oppression has many faces.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a book that shook me, and I really felt like I was taken by Richard Wright´s way of writing. The book is gripping and you really empathise with Richard while he struggles to just be an individual.\nHow I Discovered It\nThe American novel, a lecture series.\nWho Should Read It?\nPeople who are interested in modern American history, why communism failed, and Jim Crow and its effects that still rears its ugly head.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI understand more now why our society has become how it is, and the struggles of the civil rights movement paramount importance not only in the legal sense but also in the societal sense.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n“You almost scared us to death,” my mother muttered as she stripped the leaves from a tree limb to prepare it for my back.\n\n\nI was lashed so hard and long that I lost consciousness. I was beaten out of my senses and later I found myself in bed, screaming, determined to run away, tussling with my mother and father who were trying to keep me still.\n\n\nThe preacher was laughing and joking and the grownups were hanging on his words. My growing hate of the preacher finally became more important than God or religion and I could no longer contain myself. I leaped up from the table, knowing that I should be ashamed of what I was doing, but unable to stop, and screamed, running blindly from the room. “That preacher’s going to eat all the chicken!” I bawled. The preacher tossed back his head and roared with laughter, but my mother was angry and told me that I was to have no dinner because of my bad manners.\n\n\nI trembled. Granny was sending my brother to fetch Grandpa, of whom I was mortally afraid. He was a tall, skinny, silent, grim, black man who had fought in the Civil War with the Union Army. When he was angry he gritted his teeth with a terrifying, grating sound. He kept his army gun in his room, standing in a corner, loaded. He was under the delusion that the war between the states would be resumed.\n\n\nThere was no funeral. There was no music. There was no period of mourning. There were no flowers. There were only silence, quiet weeping, whispers, and fear.\n\n\nAgain paying rent became a problem and we moved nearer the center of town, where I found a job in a pressing shop, delivering clothes to hotels, sweeping floors, and listening to Negro men boast of their sex lives.\n\n\nThere were more violent quarrels in our deeply religious home than in the home of a gangster, a burglar, or a prostitute, a fact which I used to hint gently to Granny and which did my cause no good\n\n\nWherever I found religion in my life I found strife, the attempt of one individual or group to rule another in the name of God. The naked will to power seemed always to walk in the wake of a hymn.\n\n\nThis business of saving souls had no ethics; every human relationship was shamelessly exploited.\n\n\nThat was the way things were between whites and blacks in the South; many of the most important things were never openly said; they were understated and left to seep through to one.

When she reached the sidewalk, the policeman met her, grabbed her, accused her of being drunk, called a patrol wagon and carted her away.\n\n\n“Listen, nigger,” he said to me, “my ass is tough and quarters is scarce.”\n\n\nIf a white man had sought to keep us from obtaining a job, or enjoying the rights of citizenship, we would have bowed silently to his power. But if he had sought to deprive us of a dime, blood might have been split.\n\n\nAmong the topics that southern white men did not like to discuss with Negroes were the following: American white women; the Ku Klux Klan; France, and how Negro soldiers fared while there; Frenchwomen; Jack Johnson; the entire northern part of the United States; the Civil War; Abraham Lincoln; U. S. Grant; General Sherman; Catholics; the Pope; Jews; the Republican party; slavery; social equality; Communism; Socialism; the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; or any topic calling for positive knowledge or manly self-assertion on the part of the Negro.\n\n\n“I’ll never leave this goddamn South,” he railed. “I’m always saying I am, but I won’t…I’m lazy. I like to sleep too goddamn much. I’ll die here. Or maybe they’ll kill me.”\n\n\nI would have agreed to live under a system of feudal oppression, not because I preferred feudalism but because I felt that feudalism made use of a limited part of a man, defined him, his rank, his function in society. I would have consented to live under the most rigid type of dictatorship, for I felt that dictatorships, too, defined the use of men, however degrading that use might be.\n\n\nAs I, in memory, think back now upon those girls and their lives I feel that for white America to understand the significance of the problem of the Negro will take a bigger and tougher America than any we have yet known. I feel that America’s past is too shallow, her national character too superficially optimistic, her very morality too suffused with color hate for her to accomplish so vast and complex a task.\n\n\nThe feud that went on between Brand and Cooke continued. Although they were working daily in a building where scientific history was being made, the light of curiosity was never in their eyes. They were conditioned to their racial “place,” had learned to see only a part of the whites and the white world; and the whites, too, had learned to see only a part of the lives of the blacks and their world.\n\n\nIt was not the economics of Communism, nor the great power of trade unions, nor the excitement of underground politics that claimed me; my attention was caught by the similarity of the experiences of workers in other lands, by the possibility of uniting scattered but kindred peoples into a whole.\n\n\nWas shocked to hear that I, who had been only to grammar school, had been classified as an intellectual. What was an intellectual? I had never heard the word used in the sense in which it was applied to me. I had thought that they might refuse me on the grounds that I was not politically advanced; I had thought they might place me on probation; I had thought they might say I would have to be investigated.\n\n\n“He talks like a book,” one of the Negro comrades had said. And that was enough to condemn me forever as bourgeois.\n\n\nWe two black men sat in the same room looking at each other in fear. Both of us were hungry. Both of us depended upon public charity to eat and for a place to sleep. Yet we had more doubt in our hearts of each other than of the men who had cast the mold of our lives.\n\n\nI talked with white Communists about my experiences with black Communists, and I could not make them understand what I was talking about. White Communists had idealized all Negroes to the extent that they did not see the same Negroes I saw. And the more I tried to explain my ideas the more they, too, began to suspect that I was somehow dreadfully wrong.\n\n\nThe short story, Big Boy Leaves Home, had posed a question: What quality of will must a Negro possess to live and die with dignity in a country that denied his humanity?\n\n\nIt was whispered that I was trying to lead a secret group in opposition to the party. I had learned that denial of accusations was useless. It was now painful to meet a Communist, for I did not know what his attitude would be.\n\n\nI found myself arguing alone against the majority opinion and then I made still another amazing discovery. I saw that even those who agreed with me would not support me. At that meeting I learned that when a man was informed of the wish of the party he submitted, even though he knew with all the strength of his brain that the wish was not a wise one, was one that would ultimately harm the party’s interests.\n\n\nThe artist and the politician stand at opposite poles. The artist enhances life by his prolonged concentration upon it, while the politician emphasizes the impersonal aspect of life by his attempts to fit men into groups. The artist’s enhancement of life may emphasize, at certain times, those aspects that a politician can use. But the politician, at other times, eager to do good for man, may sneer at the artist because the art product cannot be used by him. Hence, the two groups of men, driving in the same direction, committed to the same vision, often find themselves locked in a struggle more desperate than either of them wanted, while their mutual enemies gape at the spectacle in amazement.\n\n\nImportant. I stood on the sidewalks of New York with a black skin, practically no money, and I was not absorbed with the burning questions of the left-wing literary movement in the United States, but with the problem of how to get a bath.\n\n\nTo my astonishment I heard that Buddy Nealson had branded me a “smuggler of reaction.” “Why does he call me that?” I asked. “He says that you are a petty bourgeois degenerate,” I was told. “What does that mean?” “He says that you are corrupting the party with your ideas,” I was told. “How?” There was no answer\n\n\nRacial hate had been the bane of my life, and here before my eyes was concrete proof that it could be abolished. Yet a new hate had come to take the place of the rankling racial hate.\n\n\nWriting had to be done in loneliness and Communism had declared war upon human loneliness.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Hitch-22":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Hitch-22","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Hitch 22.md","title":"Hitch 22","links":["Science/World/Letters-to-a-Young-Contrarian","Mich/Why-Orwell-Matters"],"tags":["memoir","non-fiction","politics","communism","facism","neo-conservatism","journalism","missing-quotes","biography"],"content":"Hitch 22\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThe memoirs of the immaculate Christopher Hitchens.

He writes about the fractions that the government was more interested in fighting amongst themselves than the enemy. And with some indignation, tells on how lies travel half the world before the truth gets its shoes on.\n🎨 Impressions\nOrwell writes so damn well. It is mesmerizing to read his raw and pure tales from a war.\nIt is fascinating how, in war, it is petty disputes and fighting that take the most energy.\nAt the front, we are all together, but in the streets back home, we hiss at each other.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIn the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona, the day before I joined the militia, I saw an Italian militiaman standing in front of the officers’ table.\n\n\nIt was not exactly a uniform. Perhaps a ‘multiform’ would be the proper name for it.\n\n\nA Spaniard’s generosity, in the ordinary sense of the word, is at times almost embarrassing.\n\n\nThe French were very brave, they said; adding enthusiastically: ‘Más valientes que nosotros’ ‘Braver than we are!’\n\n\nThe one Spanish word that no foreigner can avoid learning is mañana - ‘tomorrow’ (literally, ‘the morning’). Whenever it is conceivably possible, the business of today is put off until mañana.\n\n\nThe one Spanish word that no foreigner can avoid learning is mañana - ‘tomorrow’ (literally, ‘the morning’). Whenever it is conceivably possible, the business of today is put off until mañana. This is so notorious that even the Spaniards themselves make jokes about it.\n\n\nIn Spain nothing, from a meal to a battle, ever happens at the appointed time.\n\n\nIt appeared that even in Barcelona there were hardly any bullfights nowadays; for some reason all the best matadors were Fascists.\n\n\nWar, to me, meant roaring projectiles and skipping shards of steel; above all it meant mud, lice, hunger, and cold.\n\n\nIN trench warfare five things are important: firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy. In winter on the Zaragoza front they were important in that order, with the enemy a bad last.\n\n\n‘This is not a war,’ he used to say, ‘it is a comic opera with an occasional death.’\n\n\nThe chief importance of the affair was that it taught me to read the war news in the papers with a more disbelieving eye. A day or two later the newspapers and the radio published reports of a tremendous attack with cavalry and tanks (up a perpendicular hill-side!) which had been beaten off by the heroic English.\n\n\nWhen the fighting broke out on 18 July it is probable that every anti-Fascist in Europe felt a thrill of hope. For here at last, apparently, was democracy standing up to Fascism. For years past the so-called democratic countries had been surrendering to Fascism at every step.\n\n\nIf the war was lost democracy and revolution. Socialism and Anarchism, became meaningless words.\n\n\nThe Communist’s emphasis is always on centralism and efficiency, the Anarchist’s on liberty and equality.\n\n\nIt is also fair to the P.O.U.M. to say that though they might preach endless sermons on revolution and quote Lenin ad nauseam, they did not usually indulge in personal libel.\n\n\nOne of the most horrible features of war is that all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.\n\n\nOne of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.\n\n\nThe people who write that kind of stuff never fight; possibly they believe that to write it is a substitute for fighting.\n\n\nSince 1914-18 ‘war for democracy’ has had a sinister sound.\n\n\nIn stationary warfare there are three things that all soldiers long for: a battle, more cigarettes, and a week’s leave.\n\n\nThe human louse somewhat resembles a tiny lobster, and he lives chiefly in your trousers.\n\n\nBecome instinctive, revolution or no revolution.

In such places things happen quickly, the factions are ready-made, everyone knows the local geography, and when the guns begin to shoot people take their places almost as in a fire-drill.\n\n\nPeople do not begin building barricades unless they have received something that they regard as a provocation.\n\n\nAgain, there are the solitary men, ‘usually Fascists’, who are shooting from the roof-tops. Mr Langdon-Davies does not explain how he knew that these men were Fascists. Presumably he did not climb on to the roofs and ask them.\n\n\nIn the New Republic Mr Ralph Bates stated that the P.O.U.M. troops were ‘playing football with the Fascists in no man’s land’ at a time when, as a matter of fact, the P.O.U.M. troops were suffering heavy casualties and a number of my personal friends were killed and wounded.\n\n\nAs for the two hundred ‘full confessions’, which, if they had existed, would have been enough to convict anybody, they have never been heard of again. They were, in fact, two hundred efforts of somebody’s imagination.\n\n\nThe fact is that every war suffers a kind of progressive degradation with every month that it continues, because such things as individual liberty and a truthful press are simply not compatible with military efficiency.\n\n\nAs for the newspaper talk about this being a ‘war for democracy’, it was plain eyewash. No one in his senses supposed that there was any hope of democracy, even as we understand it in England or France, in a country so divided and exhausted as Spain would be when the war was over.\n\n\nIf we could drive Franco and his foreign mercenaries into the sea it might make an immense improvement in the world situation, even if Spain itself emerged with a stifling dictatorship and all its best men in jail. For that alone the war would have been worth winning.\n\n\nIt was like an allegorical picture of war; the trainload of fresh men gliding proudly up the line, the maimed men sliding slowly down, and all the while the guns on the open trucks making one’s heart leap as guns always do, and reviving that pernicious feeling, so difficult to get rid of, that war is glorious after all.\n\n\nNo one I met at this time - doctors, nurses, practicantes, or fellow-patients failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives it is the luckiest creature alive. I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.\n\n\nIt was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make it.\n\n\nFortunately this was Spain and not Germany. The Spanish secret police had some of the spirit of the Gestapo, but not much of its Competence.\n\n\nI know that in the middle of a huge and bloody war it is no use making too much fuss over an individual death. One aeroplane bomb in a crowded street causes more suffering than quite a lot of political persecution. But what angers one about a death like this is its utter pointlessness. To be killed in battle - yes, that is what one expects; but to be flung into jail, not even for any imaginary offence, but simply owing to dull blind spite, and then left to die in solitude - that is a different matter.\n\n\nFew Spaniards possess the damnable efficiency and consistency that a modern totalitarian state needs.\n\n\nI had been in Barcelona I went to have a look at the cathedral - a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous buildings in the world. It has four crenellated spires exactly the shape of hock bottles. Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution - it was spared because of its ‘artistic value’, people said. I think the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance, though they did hang a red and black banner between its spires.\n\n\nLondon, the barges on the miry river, the familiar streets, the posters telling of cricket matches and Royal weddings, the men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, the red buses, the blue policemen - all sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Soul-in-the-Game":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Soul-in-the-Game","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Fiction/Memoirs/Soul in the Game.md","title":"Soul in the Game","links":[],"tags":["stoicsm","philosophy","classical-music","investing","books"],"content":"Soul in the Game\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nWhat is a meaningful life?

When I moved to the US, I could not eat chicken for ten years.\n\n\nWhen people of science see a loved one facing death, they’ll cling to anything, even the empty promises of pseudoscience.\n\n\nStoic philosophers have a practice called negative visualization. You imagine you are going to lose something or somebody. There are two reasons to do this. First, it may make a loss less painful; and second, you’ll appreciate that thing or person. This is great advice for anyone.\n\n\nRussia had a draft army. It was not concerned about recruitment and thus treated its soldiers very poorly (an understatement). The pay was only high enough for soldiers to afford the postage to write home asking for money. Russian youth looked at serving in the Russian army as akin to a two-year prison sentence (at least when I was there; I have been told that has changed).\n\n\nLet’s start with soul – that’s the immaterial part of us, our essence, the dearest part of ourselves.

That becomes the apprentice’s sole focus for months. He goes through 200 batches before Jiro is satisfied with his egg custard and calls him shokunin – an artisan.\n\n\nArtisans have sacred taboos. They won’t break them for financial benefit.\n\n\nFor an artisan, the love of his craft (which often borders on art) is his primary motivation; financial considerations are always secondary.\n\n\nMaintaining the attitude of being a perpetual learner, being openminded to new knowledge, is paramount in preventing your ego and your success from fossilizing and stifling your learning and self-improvement.\n\n\nFinally, to have soul in the game, your pursuit has to be a net positive for society as a whole.

Swindoll\n\n\nYou might see a “painting,” a Malevich square, painted in one color from side to side. That’s it. A joke goes, “Every time Malevich’s square was stolen, the security guards were able to recreate it before the museum opened the next morning.”\n\n\nAlbert Einstein said, “As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it.” We should welcome “the circumference of darkness” wholeheartedly.\n\n\nMost things in the US are less than a hundred years old.

Carnegie’s was one of the first to be translated into Russian and was “the book to read.” Everyone wanted to be a capitalist, and this book was supposed to make me a better one.

I want to be there for my kids.\n\n\nMy father thought till the last moment that he’d beat the cancer, and so he never expressed his true feelings to me or my sister. A year later my father’s friend told me that my father confided in him that he wished he’d spent more time with us kids.\n\n\nTim Urban estimated that by the time you finish high school, you have spent 93% of the total time you’ll ever spend with your parents.\n\n\n“You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.”\n\n\n“Think of yourself as dead.

Mindfulness is thinking about thinking, or being aware of making decisions.\n\n\nStoic philosophy offered to me what religion could not – an operating system for this life without any promises of an afterlife, no relationship with a friend\n\n\nStoicism was started in ancient Greece around 300 BC by Zeno, a wealthy merchant who lost all his wealth in a shipwreck and barely made it out alive himself.\n\n\nFor a while Zeno’s philosophy was called Zenoism – but maybe because Zeno did not want it to become a cult of Zeno, he named it after a place in Athens where he and his students gathered, the Stoa Poikile (“painted porch”).\n\n\nA few millennia later, this tradition was borrowed by the hedge fund industry in the US, which named their companies after places where the founders grew up, had their first kiss, etc.\n\n\nMy favorite quote from Seneca is only three words long: “Time discovers truth.” It epitomizes a lot of things in life, for instance, it slices to the core of what investing is. As an investor, my goal is to discover the truth (what a company is worth) before time does.\n\n\n“In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice, there is” (which has been ascribed to that great American philosopher Yogi Berra).\n\n\nThere is an Asian proverb:¹¹ “Knowing and not doing is not knowing!”\n\n\nStoics have this wonderful concept: pre-emotion (propatheia). Pre-emotion is an innate, unjudged, unevaluated feeling.\n\n\n“One day you ordered a Happy Meal for the last time  and you didn’t even know it.”   — McDonald’s.\n\n\nAs the great Freddie Mercury put it, “Time waits for no one.”\n\n\nThe Last Time visualization is a useful daily repetition (or prayer, if you like).\n\n\n“A good person dyes events with his own color … and turns whatever happens to his own benefit.”\n\n\nNobody is perfect, yourself included. Remind yourself how many times you were wrong.\n\n\nRichard Feynman, Nobel laureate physicist, said, “You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing.”\n\n\nFirst, he constantly seeks out people he disagrees with so he can learn from them.\n\n\nYou are an average of your five closest friends.\n\n\nCovet away! But covet the whole package. The antidote to coveting is holistic coveting.\n\n\n“As an investor, you get something out of all the deadly sins – except for envy. Being envious of someone else is pretty stupid. Wishing them badly, or wishing you did as well as they did – all it does is ruin your day. Doesn’t hurt them at all, and there’s zero upside\n\n\nBuffett has a friend who survived the Holocaust. When she looks at people, she only asks one question: Would they hide me? Buffett said, “When you are 70 and you look back at your life, and you have a lot of people who would hide you, then you’ll have had a very successful life.”\n\n\nI remember hearing a story of my grandpa threatening to divorce my grandma in his late 70s when she hid his swimming trunks. Grandma called him “old fool” in a vain attempt to prevent him from swimming in the sub-ze ro weather.\n\n\n“It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.”\n\n\n“Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.”\n\n\nThe Stoics viewed money as an external advantage. The goal, however, is not to acquire as many external advantages as possible but to use them wisely.\n\n\n“If this, then…” thinking, is like saving sex for old age.\n\n\n“There is beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success.”\n\n\nStoic philosophy is an operating system for real life, and it’s a way of life that require s practice.\n\n\n“We don’t get paid for activity; we get paid for being right. As to how long we’ll wait, we’ll wait indefinitely.”\n\n\nTo quote the not-so-great Joseph Stalin: “Quantity has a quality of its own.”\n\n\nWent to lunch with a guy who ran a Fortune 500 company, and I asked him what he looked for in the people he hired. He said, “Look for the two C’s: Competency and character. Hire people that will own a task.” This is what I do. Someone gave me another piece of advice that I also took to heart: Hire slowly, but fire fast.\n\n\nThere are four modes of communicating: preacher, prosecutor, politician, and scientist.\n\n\nIf you are in preacher mode, you are fully convinced of your belief and are trying to get others to embrace your gospel. A politician is trying to win the approval of others with a message he may or may not believe in. A prosecutor is trying to build an argument to convince you to change your mind.\n\n\nSteve Jobs, in addition to being a visionary, had the talent of being able to convince others to do what seemed impossible. Apple employees called it “Steve’s reality distortion field.” Jobs was in preacher mode.\n\n\nHowever, scientist mode has its own appeal. A scientist treats ideas as hypotheses that need to be tested. Ideas are just malleable starting points (as opposed to hardened truths) for further investigation.\n\n\nWhat stands between other modes and the scientist mode is our ego. I keep coming back to Epictetus when he says, “It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”\n\n\n“Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.”\n\n\n“I’m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition. I think that I am qualified to speak only when I’ve reached that state.”\n\n\nAdmit where your arguments are weak. This goes to the core of intellectual honesty. This will only make the search for the truth more expeditious.\n\n\nHere is another example. Intellectual debate is deeply embedded in the Jewish legal system. By Jewish law, a court will not accept a capital punishment verdict if it was delivered by a unanimous decision of 23 judges who decide upon capital cases. Yes, you read that right. There has to be at least one dissenting opinion for the death penalty verdict to be accepted. The court wants to make sure there was at least one voice in the proceedings that forced judges to confront the opposing argument. In other words, the court wants to make sure the decision was not merely tribal, but was debated.\n\n\nThe premiere of Rachmaninoff’s first symphony in Saint Petersburg in 1897 was an utter disaster. How bad? One music critic compared it to the ten plagues of Egypt. It was under-rehearsed by the orchestra, and there is even a theory that the conductor was drunk. Rachmaninoff wrote, “If the public were familiar with the symphony, they would blame the conductor (I continue to ‘assume’), but when a composition is both unknown and badly performed, the public is inclined to blame the composer.”\n\n\n“Few people think more than two or three times a year; I have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.”\n\n\nAuthor Tom Clancy once said, “Writer’s block is just an official term for being lazy, and the way to get through it is work.”\n\n\nMy teachers turned Russian literature into Mark Twain’s definition of classic s : Books that people praise and don’t read. I am still trying to get back into Russian literature.\n\n\nTchaikovsky (1840–1893) was a master of emotions. He was a neurotic, highly sensitive person, full of phobias. For instance, he had a phobia that his head would fall off when he was conducting. (He eventually overcame this phobia, since at times he had to earn a living as a conductor.) His music is ridden with emotions; it is the manifestation of his emotions. It is his emotional confession.\n\n\n“I hope to be able to make something of myself, but who can do anything after Beethoven?”   – Franz Schubert\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the American public did not care for Edvard Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A minor, but today it is one of the most-performed piano concertos.\n\n\nCraft is a skill that accumulates with time and is formed by experience, practice, learning, and usually a lot of repetition. It is a fundamental layer of any creative endeavour.\n\n\nAnd then there is art. Art needs tension. This tension is caused by the uncertainty, the fogginess, that lies between the present and a final outcome. It is filled with conflicting emotions.\n\n\n“Little kids don’t let you sleep; big kids don’t let you live”\n\n\nPablo Picasso’s “Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.”\n\n\nIt was common thinking in the early 19th century that Beethoven’s 9th Symphony was the be all and end all of symphonies\n\n\nHeard a story about the French Impressionist painter Edgar Degas. He was a perfectionist and had an incredibly hard time completing his paintings. Often, when he would encounter one of his paintings hanging in someone else’s house, he’d stare at it intensely for a while and then ask the owner of the painting whether he or she would mind lending it to him so he could finish it. Who could say no to this? As the story goes, sometimes the owner would never get the painting back, as Degas would ruin it in the process of trying to make it perfect.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Africa/Dancing-in-the-Glory-of-Monsters":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Africa/Dancing-in-the-Glory-of-Monsters","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Africa/Dancing in the Glory of Monsters.md","title":"Dancing in the Glory of Monsters","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","history","Rwanda","Uganda","Africa","consulting/reflections","history/military","war","civil-war"],"content":"Dancing in the Glory of Monsters\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book covers the civil war of Congo, a long period from the mid-nineties to mid-oughts.

At least the Rwanda massacre got a fucking film.\nYou can say a lot about Africa, but never doubt their sense of humor. They have some of the funniest political jokes in the world. Take, for example Grace Mugabe, who has the following nicknames:\n\nGucci Grace\nGreedy Grace\n“Dis”-Grace\nMy notes from this book are quite extensive, and I think one reason for that is the lack of other materials around this topic made me more able to absorb the knowledge.\n\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nPower is Eaten Whole. —CONGOLESE SAYING\n\n\nThe Congolese war must be put among the other great human cataclysms of our time: the World Wars, the Great Leap Forward in China, the Rwandan and Cambodian genocides.\n\n\nNewspapers with extensive foreign coverage, gave Darfur nearly four times the coverage it gave the Congo in 2006, when Congolese were dying of war-related causes at nearly ten times the rate of those in Darfur.\n\n\nEven Nicholas Kristof, the Times columnist who has campaigned vigorously for humanitarian crises around the world, initially used the confusion of the Congo as a justification for reporting on it less—it is less evil because it is less ideologically defined.\n\n\nThis brutality prompted the first international human rights campaign, led by missionaries and activists, including Mark Twain and Arthur Conan Doyle. Under pressure, King Leopold capitulated and handed the country over to the Belgian government in 1908.\n\n\n“In the Congo, in order to survive, we all have to be a bit corrupt, a bit ruthless. That’s the system here. That’s just the reality of things. If you don’t bribe a bit and play to people’s prejudices, someone else who does will replace you.” He winked and added, “Even you, if you were thrown into this system, you would do the same. Or sink.”\n\n\nThe Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara spent almost a year in the Congo in 1965 fighting with rebels in the east before he abandoned the struggle. Malnourished and depressed, he concluded they “weren’t ready for the revolution.” The Congo has always defied the idealists.\n\n\n“The anti-Tutsi propaganda was part of our military tactics,” he said, smiling affably. “We didn’t believe it, but in a guerrilla war you have to motivate soldiers and indoctrinate the population.”\n\n\nHis guilt came from his obedience, his mindless desire to please his hierarchy.\n\n\nIn late 1990, the political situation in the country deteriorated rapidly. A range of factors contributed to this: The price of Rwanda’s main exports, tin and tea, had collapsed over recent years, leading to a contraction of the national budget by 40 percent. The same year, after seventeen years of one-party rule, Habyarimana decided to open his country to multiparty democracy, prompting a proliferation of political parties with affiliated radio stations and newsletters, some of which resorted to explicit ethnic hate-mongering.\n\n\nWhen talking about the genocide, he emphasized the military, not the human dimension: “The army deployed most of its forces to massacre civilians, diverting trucks, ammunition, and manpower to slaughter them. The genocide caused our resistance to crumble. It was a cafouillage, a real mess.”\n\n\nThe words “chaos,” “mess,” and “confusion” recurred in my discussions with the general. They contrasted with his refrain that all he tried to do during this time was obey orders and uphold discipline. They were two conflicting ways of absolving himself from responsibility, but also means of coping morally and psychologically with the killing around him.\n\n\nHe was, however, part of an organization that caused the deaths of over 800,000 people, and he was in a position to save lives. When I pressed Rwarakabije about his loyalty to the army, even when it became obvious that many of his superiors were involved in the massacres, he shook his head, exasperated: “You are much too logical about this! We were in the middle of a war. We didn’t have time to think whether we were complicit in a genocide—we were just trying to survive!”\n\n\n“He was a disciplinarian to the core. He never really asked why he was fighting; that was for the politicians to decide. And when the politicians ran, he just kept on fighting, like a robot.”\n\n\nRecent studies of the genocide have also revealed the importance of local politics in determining whether an area carried out genocide or not. Seasonal laborers and the landless, for example, were more likely to be manipulated by rural elites who stood to lose if the Hutu regime lost power.\n\n\nSince the Tutsi forces were known as inyenzi, or cockroaches, this offensive was dubbed Operation Insecticide.\n\n\nAnatole Sucyendore was a Hutu doctor who had fled to Goma with the other refugees but had returned to Rwanda several months later to work in the Gisenyi hospital, despite numerous death threats. On February 25, 1995, Hutu rebels broke into his house, shot the doctor, stabbed his two-year-old infant to death, and severely injured his wife and other child.\n\n\n“Did you ever order the killing of civilians?” “No, never.” “But civilians were killed.” Rwarakabije sighed and fidgeted with his loose watch again. “Chain of command … I’m not sure you can apply that to our rebellion.” “You didn’t control some of your own commanders?” “My troops, yes. But the civilian ideologues, the extremists, no.\n\n\nRwarakabije ducked and weaved, denying responsibility, blaming massacres on others, using ends to justify means. “Where elephants fight,” he said, “the grass is trampled.” It was a convenient metaphor. Almost every commander I met in the region used it when I asked them about abuses against civilians.\n\n\nBack to the description of Eichmann’s trial: “Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.”\n\n\nThe refugee camps were set up in July 1994 and stayed in place for over two years. Some would swell to contain more than 400,000 inhabitants, becoming the largest refugee camps in the world and larger than any city in eastern Zaire. Together they housed over a million people. In a perverse way, they provoked a mobilization of international resources that the genocide never had.\n\n\nWomen had other problems, as well. The aid organizations running the camps didn’t provide sanitary napkins, and women had to use rags or tear up sheets to use instead. As there was little soap, these scraps of cloth became hard and caked with blood. To their humiliation, women had no choice but to try to wash these in the same pots they used for cooking. “The bloodied water snaked in rivulets between the tents and little puddles of blood formed here and there.”\n\n\nIn late 1994, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spent $1 million each day on operations in the camps. Its effort was effective: Within weeks of deployment, mortality dropped steeply, saving thousands of lives. At the same time, however, it became obvious that the aid was also sustaining the perpetrators of the genocide\n\n\nDoctors Without Borders, put it: “How can physicians continue to assist Rwandan refugees when by doing so they are also supporting killers?” And they were supporting killers. Camp leaders refused to allow UNHCR to count the refugees for over half a year, inflating their numbers so as to pocket the surplus food, blankets, and clothes for themselves.\n\n\nIn Ngara, Tanzania, food for 120,000 “ghost refugees” was being skimmed off the top, while in Bukavu leaders pocketed aid for 50,000 refugees over six months.\n\n\nEven after censuses were carried out, leaders stole the food of those most in need, pushing thousands of children into severe malnutrition.\n\n\nThe response, as so often in the region, was to throw money at the humanitarian crisis but not to address the political causes.\n\n\nAs a senior French official was quoted anonymously as saying: “We cannot let anglophone countries decide on the future of a francophone one.\n\n\nThe RPF, who were already disgusted by international inaction during the genocide, watched in despair. “By early 1996, it was clear to us that the international community would not take action,”\n\n\nAfrica has the shape of a pistol, and Congo is its trigger. —FRANTZ FANON\n\n\nNo family was spared by the violence. Over 90 percent of children and youths had witnessed violence and believed they would die; only slightly fewer had experienced a death in their family.\n\n\nA study published in a psychiatric journal estimated that one-fourth of all Rwandans suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome.1 They called these people ihahamuka, “without lungs” or “breathless with fear.” They would walk through town, catatonic, jumping when a bus honked or someone came up behind them unannounced.\n\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Habyarimana regime, RPF leaders celebrated victory in Kigali; Ugandan waragi—a strong gin made out of millet—was a favorite. Mixed with Coca Cola, it was dubbed “Kigali Libre” by RPF officers.\n\n\nKagame fulminated to the press: “I think we have learned a lot about the hypocrisy and double standards on the part of people who claim that they want to make this world a better place.”\n\n\nIn a region where international donors supply on average half of government budgets, and where the legacy of French, U.S., and Russian power politics was apparent, blatant violations of sovereignty had to be planned carefully\n\n\nThe war with UNITA was understandably an obsession for the Angolan government. In 1996, there were 1.2 million displaced people in the country, amounting to 10 percent of the total population, and the government was spending over half of its budget on the military.\n\n\nNever had so many African countries united militarily behind one cause, leading some to dub the war Africa’s World War.\n\n\nIt was a regional conflict, pitting a new generation of young, visionary African leaders against Mobutu Sese Seko, the continent’s dinosaur. Never had so many African countries united militarily behind one cause, leading some to dub the war Africa’s World War.\n\n\n“His morphology is suspicious,” one sometimes heard people saying when they suspected someone of being Tutsi. As if you could tell someone’s subversion by his bone structure or the slant of his nose.\n\n\nAcross the border, in Burundi, where many Banyamulenge fled, they were call kijuju after a local plant that looked like cassava but couldn’t be eaten—a useless, treacherous substance.\n\n\nLike layers of an onion, the Congo war contains wars within wars. There was not one Congo war, or even two, but at least forty or fifty different, interlocking wars.\n\n\nIn my interviews, I often made the mistake of asking the interviewee to start from the beginning. “The beginning?” A look of bemused condescension would follow—what does this young foreigner know about our beginnings? “Good idea. Well, in 1885, at the Conference of Berlin. …”\n\n\nA diligent student of Machiavelli—The Prince could often be seen on his bedside table—Mobutu had mastered the art of divide-and-rule politics.\n\n\nBeing part of a minority community in such a turbulent area means living in a pressure cooker in which family loyalty means everything; Papy could recite his clan genealogy six generations back.\n\n\n“As soon as the RPF conquered Rwanda,” he told me, “they set their sights on invading Zaire, much sooner than most people realize.”\n\n\nTembele, whom a UN official remembered as “famous for being afraid of his own soldiers” and stealing cars from the refugees, had been bribed by the Rwandans and even provided Bugera with one of his lieutenants as a liaison officer, institutionalizing his treason.\n\n\nIt is amazing to what extent the ethnic stereotypes and conflicts that were born in Rwanda have contaminated the rest of the region.\n\n\nOne day, when I was arguing that you had to understand Tutsi paranoia, as it had its roots in the massacre of up to 800,000 Tutsi in Rwanda during the genocide, she replied, “Eight hundred thousand? Obviously it wasn’t enough. There are still some left.”\n\n\nLaurent Kabila’s presence is hard to miss in Kinshasa. In the middle of town, he towers as a forty-foot statue (thanks to North Korean sculptors, experts in state-sponsored hagiography),\n\n\nThe Chinese were not the only ones to misjudge the strength of socialism. Che Guevara led an expedition to support Kabila’s insurrection in the eastern Congo in 1965. Fidel Castro’s government, newly in power, had immediately embarked on exporting their revolutionary and anti-imperialist ideology elsewhere.\n\n\nNevertheless, Che’s experience, as well as the insurrection, ended in disaster. The beginning words of his Congo journal were: “This is the history of a failure.”\n\n\nThe nadir was perhaps reached in 1975, when Kabila’s forces snuck into Jane Goodall’s chimpanzee research camp in western Tanzania and kidnapped four American and Dutch students. They subjected their captives to lectures on Marxism and Leninism while demanding a ransom of $500,000. This was the last straw for Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, who had been tolerating the rebels out of disdain for Mobutu.\n\n\nAccording to accounts that filtered out from his commanders, Kabila would resort to a Mobutist subterfuge, regularly sleeping with his commanders’ wives as a display of power and humiliation.\n\n\nKaregeya laughed at me when I questioned their choice of a rebel leader. “You act like we had a lot of options! By 1996, Mobutu had co-opted or locked up almost all of his opposition, with the possible exception of Tshisekedi. Kabila might have been old-school, but he had not been bought off. We gave him some credit for that.”\n\n\nYears later, Bugera laughed when he heard Masasu’s name. “You know he ended up being a popular commander, very popular. But then, he was a kid! They said he had a political party, but he was the only member in it.”\n\n\nFor many Congolese who had labored long—and ultimately unsuccessfully—to overthrow Mobutu peacefully, Kabila was a living symbol of foreign meddling in their country. It is one of the Congo’s historical ironies that the same man came to be seen as a bulwark of patriotism and resistance against Rwandan aggression.\n\n\n“A tree trunk does not turn itself into a crocodile because it has spent some time in the water. In the same way, a Tutsi will forever remain a Tutsi, with his or her perfidy, craftiness and dishonesty.”\n\n\nBy 1996, social conditions in Zaire were ripe for youth-led violence. Due to Mobutu’s predation and disastrous economic policies, the country’s infrastructure and industry had collapsed. By 1996, the country had been through seven years of economic contraction.\n\n\nZairians earned just over half of what they had been making in 1990. According to the United Nations, a full 27 million people, or 60 percent of the population, were undernourished. Even when people were paid, the money was worth little: Inflation soared to 5,000 percent in 1996.\n\n\nIn negotiating bribes, the local official’s main leverage is time.\n\n\nThe chief leaned over and whispered: “The United States is using earthquakes as a weapon of war to destabilize the province!”\n\n\nAlex, a Munyamulenge boy in an Arsenal T-shirt and jeans, demurred: “I don’t know why we have to inherit the sins of our fathers and brothers. For them, we are all guilty.” He paused, then added, “We are all targets.”\n\n\n“Our problem is with leadership,” Remy said in the car. “Imagine that we were CIA agents trying to start a new rebellion here. We would have bought them all off for twenty dollars.”\n\n\nThe heat in the small room became unbearable. The air was getting heavy; in the distance they could hear a thunderstorm moving down the floodplain from Rwanda. The storms from the east were the worst; Congolese used to quip that “all bad things come from Rwanda.”\n\n\nSeleelwa was eager to speak with us about the beginning of the war. “Nobody has ever come to hear our story,” he lamented. “Not the United Nations, not our own government, nobody.”\n\n\nProsecute those leaders, and they will start the war again, the prevailing wisdom goes. Plus, some Congolese leaders say, war is nasty, and people die. One erudite politician reminded me:“Didn’t General Ulysses Grant give an amnesty for Confederate soldiers after the American Civil War? Didn’t the Spanish do the same for crimes committed under Franco? Why should it be different for us?” Unfortunately, the impunity has thus far brought little peace, and the criminals of yesterday become the recidivists of tomorrow.\n\n\n“We didn’t have an army; we had individuals,” Nabyolwa remembered.\n\n\nBy 1996, Zaire was a teetering house of cards—as the Economist quipped, “They call it a country. In fact it is just a Zaire-shaped hole in the middle of Africa.”\n\n\nThe army that Nabyolwa joined in 1973 was a jumble of contradictions. Like the rest of the state apparatus, it was present everywhere, harassing and taxing the population, but effective nowhere.\n\n\nMobutu famously declared in a speech to the army, “You have guns; you don’t need a salary.”\n\n\nIt was another manifestation of his famous “Article 15,” a fictitious clause in an obsolete constitution that called for the population to do anything\n\n\nIs difficult to overstate the impact these policies\n\n\nIt was another manifestation of his famous “Article 15,” a fictitious clause in an obsolete constitution that called for the population to do anything they needed to do to survive. Débrouillez-vous (“improvise” or “get by”) became the modus operandi for Zairians of all classes, in particular the armed forces.\n\n\nEvery time you send us into battle, we get attacked!’ “‘But that’s what war is about!’ “‘You are a sadist!’”\n\n\nInternal tensions also hampered operations. The French, mostly former soldiers from the Foreign Legion, were better connected and paid up to five times as much as the Serbs—up to $10,000 per month for the officers. But the Serbs controlled most of the aircraft and heavy weaponry, old machines leased at inflated prices from the Yugoslav army. The French accused their counterparts of amateurism; the Serbs retorted that the last time the French had won a serious battle was at Austerlitz in 1805.\n\n\nIt is easy to make a mockery of Mobutu’s army and government, to reduce the events that led to his demise to a comedy of errors carried on by a bunch of incompetent, bumbling generals in Kinshasa. But it was not for lack of training or expertise that the Zairian army lost the war. The security forces included a legion of intelligent officers trained at some of the world’s best military academies. The problem was the decaying, corrupt structures within which they worked. Lacking proper institutions since independence, Mobutu had corroded his own state in order to prevent any challengers to his power from emerging, eroding that very power in the process.\n\n\n“The real challenge in the Congo,” Nabyolwa told me, “is not how to reform the army, but how to reform the men in the army! There is a serious problem with Homo congoliensis!”\n\n\nAsked Papy why he did it. It was an order, he replied. Why did your commander want to do it? He shrugged. That was the mentality at the time. They needed to fear the AFDL. They had committed genocide. It was revenge, he said. But it was also a warning: Don’t try to mess with us.\n\n\nI asked Papy why he did it. It was an order, he replied. Why did your commander want to do it? He shrugged. That was the mentality at the time. They needed to fear the AFDL. They had committed genocide. It was revenge, he said. But it was also a warning: Don’t try to mess with us.\n\n\nIf 80,000 refugees died in the Congo, that may be terrible but nonetheless minor compared with the 800,000 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThe rationale for child recruitment was simple: Many commanders consider that children make better, more loyal, and fearless soldiers. One commander of a local Mai-Mai militia told me: “You never know who you can trust. At least with the kadogo, you know they will never betray you.”\n\n\nFor the most part, the kind of combat that soldiers engaged in was guerrilla warfare, involving risky ambushes and close-quarter fighting with the enemy. Soldiers did not have protective gear, and artillery was in scant supply. If you wanted to hit the enemy, you needed to be close enough to be effective with an AK-47—within two hundred meters of the target. Children were often the only soldiers who had the guts to engage in many of the operations, who actually obeyed orders, and whose sense of danger was not as well developed as that of older soldiers. The use of children as vanguard special forces\n\n\nMobutu’s health began to fail him again. Within a month, he was back in Europe for further treatment. The vicious tongues in the capital began to wag with new rumors of his ill health. When the Central Bank issued yet another new banknote to keep track of rising inflation, it was quickly dubbed “the Prostate.” Just like the president’s gland, it was inflating daily. Just like the illness, these banknotes could seriously damage your health.\n\n\nA cat goes to a monastery, but she still remains a cat. —CONGOLESE SAYING\n\n\nKinshasa had become the third largest city in Africa and among the top twenty in the world, but it seemed like an oversized village. There was no functioning postal service or public transit system, and despite an overabundance of rainfall, over two million city dwellers did not have direct access to a water supply. Ninety-five percent of the population worked in the informal sector: lugging bags of cassava, shining shoes, hawking everything from aphrodisiacs to cigarettes and nail polish along the bustling streets. Tens of thousands of civil servants still showed up for work in old suits and ties—but were rarely paid.\n\n\nHim on the country’s economy. It wasn’t a pretty picture. The country’s income had shrunk to a third of what it had been at independence in 1960. Inflation was at 750 percent. Between 1988 and 1996, copper production had plummeted from 506,000 to 38,000 tons, while industrial diamond production dropped from 10 million to 6.5 million carats. Coffee, palm oil, and tea production followed the same trend. Only 5 percent of the population had salaried jobs; many of those worked for the state on salaries as low as five dollars a month.\n\n\nWhen Kabila’s forces arrived in Kinshasa, one of their first stops naturally had been the Central Bank. The future vice governor of the bank had the honor of opening the vaults, only to find the huge cement chambers empty. A lonely fifty French franc note was left in one of the drawers, “as an insult.”\n\n\nEven Nelson Mandela, the dean of African democracy, deemed it “suicidal” for Kabila to allow free party activities before he had a firm grip on the government.\n\n\nKabila threw Tshisekedi into prison several times, but he proved impossible to shut up. Finally, in February 1997, Kabila lost his patience and had him deported to his remote home village of Kabeya-Kamwanga “with a tractor and some soy seeds so he can put his leadership skills to the service of our agricultural sector.”\n\n\nSenior U.S. diplomat and the Congolese head of state were not good. Several months before her visit, during the height of the refugee crisis, Albright had called Kabila, threatening serious consequences if he didn’t allow investigators into the country to find out what had happened with the missing Rwandan refugees. Kabila had hung up on Albright mid-sentence, muttering, “Imperialist!”\n\n\n“It was like what the Americans did with the Baath Party in Iraq,” one official in the Ministry of Mines told me. “From one day to the next, everybody was gone.”\n\n\nTwo of the new ministers had had run-ins with the law abroad. Thomas Kanza, who was in charge of regional cooperation and aid, was unable to deal with the U.S. government because he was wanted in Tennessee for fleeing a $300,000 fine for fraud. Celestin Lwangy’s nomination for justice minister elicited some chuckles in the Belgian press, as he had served eight months in prison in Belgium for illegally hooking up his electricity supply to the power grid.\n\n\nHead of state, the refugee crisis dominated discussions. Immediately after he was sworn in, all contacts with the Congo’s traditional donors—Belgium, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—focused on the alleged massacres.\n\n\nAccording to Bugera, a delegation of military officials from various southern African countries was visiting Kinshasa to see how the formation of the new army was proceeding. Many countries had invested in this project by sending officers to help train the new recruits and integrate Congo’s fractured militias. During a long meeting with Kabila, a Tanzanian commander excused himself, saying he had to use the toilet. Kabila looked around sheepishly and finally ordered a bodyguard to find the key for the toilet. The bodyguard ran about, but was unable to come up with the key. Finally, the Tanzanian was taken to a toilet in another building much further away. After their meeting was finished, Kabila reprimanded his bodyguard with a laugh, fishing a key out of his pocket: “You idiot! I had the key the whole time! All my money is stored in that toilet—I couldn’t let him in there!”\n\n\nNo matter how hard you throw a dead fish in the water, it still won’t swim. —CONGOLESE SAYING\n\n\nWhen he arrived to take over his office from his Rwandan predecessor, he allegedly brought a goat with him that he proceeded to slaughter so as to chase away the evil spirits.\n\n\nGeneral Celestin Kifwa, the new commander, was over sixty years old and incompetent. They called him a fetisheur, a witch doctor, as it was rumored that he believed in magic potions and in consulting the ancestors to make decisions. When he arrived to take over his office from his Rwandan predecessor, he allegedly brought a goat with him that he proceeded to slaughter so as to chase away the evil spirits.\n\n\nFighting surrounding them. “You know, Japan dominated China. That is normal. But I will not let our great country be dominated by its tiny neighbor. Can a toad swallow an elephant? No!”\n\n\nBegan to complain that they would be killed if they landed at the heavily fortified airbase. “Don’t worry,” Butera said. “We have our people at the airport.” Using the pilot’s high-frequency radio, he programmed a frequency he said belonged to their commander on the ground. A surprisingly clear voice responded to his call in calm English: “All clear, afande. You can land.” What the pilot did not know was that the radio Butera was calling actually belonged to his deputy commander, who was lounging in a seat at the back of the plane.\n\n\nDespite the pistol-waving Rwandan behind him, the pilot began to complain that they would be killed if they landed at the heavily fortified airbase. “Don’t worry,” Butera said. “We have our people at the airport.” Using the pilot’s high-frequency radio, he programmed a frequency he said belonged to their commander on the ground. A surprisingly clear voice responded to his call in calm English: “All clear, afande. You can land.” What the pilot did not know was that the radio Butera was calling actually belonged to his deputy commander, who was lounging in a seat at the back of the plane.\n\n\nSometimes even the Rwandans foul things up: Butera had forgotten to take down the pin code for the satellite phone, without which it was useless. In Kigali, his commanding officers waited in vain for word from the young soldier, while he tried frantically to punch in different six-digit combinations. No luck. (The correct code was apparently 123456.) The pilot also failed to reach Kigali on his ham radio.\n\n\nAs Kinois often quip: “We put Mobutu in the ambulance. All Kabila did was drive the corpse to the cemetery.”\n\n\nFormer colleague of his quoted a Swahili proverb to me: “Don’t get into a ship with a hole in the bottom; it will eventually sink.”\n\n\nA Congolese friend once described the curse of Congolese politics as “the reverse Midas effect.” “Anything touched by politics in the Congo turns to shit,” he told me. “It doesn’t matter if the Holy Father himself decides to run for president, he will inevitably come out corrupt, power-hungry, and guilty of breaking all ten of the holy commandments.”\n\n\nAccording to François Mwamba, the head of their finances, they rarely got more than 50,000 a month. “Once, I had to spend ten hours on the back of a motorcycle, hanging on to a kid with an AK-47 strapped on his back, just to collect 2,000 from a bank in the jungle town of Banalia,” Mwamba told me. “Do you think I would be doing that if we were flush with cash?”\n\n\nSwahili saying: Shukrani ya punda ni teke (The gratitude of a donkey is a kick).\n\n\nThey had experience in war, like many Congolese. They knew that AK-47s had enough power to go through a brick wall and still kill: “You really need two brick walls to protect yourself.”\n\n\nHe was friends with some of the Rwandan officers and spent the evenings drinking waragi gin, smoking, and talking with them. Most were well-educated and curious about international affairs; they discussed the similarities and differences between wars in the Balkans and those in Central Africa.\n\n\n“I was sad I couldn’t bury my son next to his siblings,” Philippe said in a calm voice. “But we still remember his birthday every year. We eat fried catfish, his favorite.” He paused again for a long time. “ I was also angered by the arrogance of these two countries. Coming to settle their differences 300 miles from home, killing innocent civilians. What did we ever do to them?”\n\n\nDeath does not sound a trumpet. —CONGOLESE SAYING\n\n\nIn June 2000, a nonprofit charity published a mortality study that estimated that 1.7 million people had died as a result of the conflict between August 1998 and May 2000.\n\n\nIn 2004, the charity estimated that 3.8 million had died because of the war since 1998.1\n\n\nOn the wall there was a faded picture of Jesus in a wooden frame with a saying in Swahili: “A drunken wife arouses anger. Her shame cannot be hidden.”\n\n\nSome of them had radios, and they gave the nickname “Kosovo” to their hometown of Kasika after they heard of the war and massacres in the Balkans. The main difference, of course, was that the press was giving the small Balkan region, barely a sixth the size of South Kivu Province, nonstop coverage, while no foreign journalist visited Kasika for a decade.\n\n\nSocial life was deeply affected as well. The death of their traditional chief, along with the only priest, left the community without any leaders.\n\n\nI ask them if they could ever forgive the soldiers for what they did. “Forgive whom? We don’t even know who did it,” someone outside Patrice’s house said.\n\n\n“We are still living through the massacre,” one elder who had lost his wife and two children told me. “There has been no justice, not even a sign on a tree, or a monument in the honor of those who died that day.”11 “We all lived in the forests like animals for five years,” said a man in a plaid shirt and a baseball cap. “Our children are all illiterate because of this. Go to primary school here, and you will find fifteen-year-olds sitting on the benches.” The conversation\n\n\n“We are still living through the massacre,” one elder who had lost his wife and two children told me. “There has been no justice, not even a sign on a tree, or a monument in the honor of those who died that day.”11 “We all lived in the forests like animals for five years,” said a man in a plaid shirt and a baseball cap. “Our children are all illiterate because of this. Go to primary school here, and you will find fifteen-year-olds sitting on the benches.”\n\n\nAccording to United Nations reports, over 200,000 women have been raped in the eastern Congo since 1998. Demographic surveys suggest that up to 39 percent of women have experienced sexual violence, at the hands of civilians or military personnel, at some point in their lives.\n\n\nWhen asked about the reasons for the war, a full half of Kinois answered that they thought it was “a conspiracy of western powers,” while 19 percent thought it was due to “Tutsi hegemony in central Africa.”\n\n\n“It was like Mobutu all over again,” a presidential aide told me. “Someone had sold all the helicopter fuel to make a profit. We were the victims of our own ineptitude.”\n\n\nSo who ordered the killing of Mzee? Congolese imagination is knotted around Kabila’s death, entangled in multiple narratives and histories that compete to explain why the scrawny bodyguard shot the president. Part of the problem is that there were too many people who had a reason, who stood to benefit from his death. As the Economist quipped, fifty million people—the country’s entire population—had a motive. By the time of his death, Kabila had managed to offend or alienate not only his enemies but also most of his allies.\n\n\nPeople weave rumors and myths together over drinks or while waiting for taxis to help give meaning to their lives. It may, for example, be easier to believe that Joseph Kabila’s real name is Hippolyte Kanambé and that he is a Rwandan, acting in the interests of Paul Kagame, or to believe that the conflict in the Congo was all an American corporate conspiracy to extract minerals from the country. Either might be easier to swallow than the complex, tangled reality. Doesn’t it give more meaning to the Congolese’s grim everyday existence?\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, working from incomplete budgetary data that probably excluded some revenue, concluded that at the height of the war in 2000, the Congolese government was spending 70 percent of its expenditures on “sovereign and security items,” a budget line that was managed entirely by the presidency and dedicated mostly to the war.\n\n\nAccording to a World Bank study, if you paid all of your taxes in the Congo—a full thirty-two different payments—you would be dishing out 230 percent of your profits.\n\n\nSeveral months later, a UN report concluded that Rwanda and Uganda were plundering the eastern Congo for personal enrichment and in order to finance the war.\n\n\nFiguring out how power works in Kinshasa is a complicated affair. Foreign businessmen arriving from Europe or China have to spend weeks to get to the right people in government. Connections are everything. Il a un bon carnet d’adresses—“He has a good address book”—is high praise from entrepreneurs in the capital.\n\n\nA key word in the Congolese lexicon of corruption is enveloppe. If you want to buy votes in Parliament to squelch the audit of your state-run company, you pass around envelopes. When you want to obtain a lucrative contract to supply the police with beans and rice, you make sure the officials on the procurement board all get envelopes delivered to their home. The operative verb is usually “to circulate,” and typically used in the passive voice, as if the envelopes were floating around on their own accord. On a fait circuler des enveloppes (envelopes were circulated around). The enveloppe preserves the dignity of the recipient: You avoid the crude embarrassment of receiving naked cash from your benefactor. After all, who can turn down an anonymous envelope whose contents are unknown?\n\n\nReforming the state will require tackling entrenched interests and mafia-like networks that permeate the administration. In doing so, he risks offending powerful people, who could then try to unseat him. In 2004, after a botched coup attempt in downtown Kinshasa, I remember speaking with outraged security agents who told me, “We know who is behind [the coup attempt], but we can’t do anything!”\n\n\nHistorians often use the Latin phrase bellum se ipsum alet to describe the phenomenon—the war feeds itself. This is a concept many Congolese commanders would understand.\n\n\nThe only viable means of popular mobilization remains ethnicity, although even that has been gutted of much of its moral content by generations of customary rulers co-opted and repressed by the state. These ethnicity-based organizations, whether political parties or armed groups, mobilize for greater resources for their own narrow community, not for the public good.\n\n\nIn large part, however, our sins have been of omission. We simply do not care enough. Contrary to what some Congolese believe, President Obama does not wake up to a security briefing on the Congo with his morning scone. Generally, we do not care about a strange war fought by black people somewhere in the middle of Africa. This sad hypocrisy is easy to see—NATO sent 50,000 troops from some of the best armies to Kosovo in 1999, a country one-fifth the size of South Kivu. In the Congo, the UN peacekeeping mission plateaued at 20,000 troops, mostly from South Asia, ill-equipped and with little will to carry out risky military operations. In exchange, the Congo has received plentiful humanitarian aid—a short-term solution to a big problem.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Americas/1776":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Americas/1776","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Americas/1776.md","title":"1776","links":[],"tags":["books","history","american-revolution","revolution","american-history"],"content":"1776\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nBook contians the storeis of Washington and the continental army through the tumultuous year of 1776.

From his diary—albeit abbreviated, and hurriedly jotted down—we know that the Seventh marched to Providence, then through Massachusetts to Cambridge, headquarters of the American forces surrounding Boston, where they had Gage and his forces bottled up. Once there, the regiment was assigned to General John Sullivan’s brigade at Winter Hill; Hale was promoted to captain-lieutenant, and signed up for another contract of service for 1776 at a time when many refused to reenlist when their terms were up. His regiment was then renamed the “Nineteenth Foot in the service of the United Colonies,” as part of Washington’s effort to mold his gaggle of\n\n\nHe resembled, in a way, a modern Jew who eats pork but strongly identifies with humanistic Judaism, or a secular Catholic who, much to his dismay, can’t help but perceive the world in terms of sin, confession, and good works.\n\n\nAside from the tardiness of his correspondence, two tics, both of them irritating to Washington, characterized Woodhull’s letters. First, he liked to add his personal views. So, for instance, in November he attends a meeting of Loyalists, and noting that “with much satisfaction I beheld their dejected countenances,” he pompously declares that “I am firmly of opinion that a sudden attack of ten thousand men would take the City and put an end to the War.” There was “not much to be feared from the inhabitants” of Manhattan, he casually appends, as “the whole City is seized with a panic and a general dissatisfaction.” By December, Woodhull had convinced himself that if Washington waited but four months, “I am confident they will go themselves, Yes I am firmly of opinion and it is become general belief that in half the time we shall have the news of Great Britain acknowledging American independence.” Washington soon learned to filter out Woodhull’s grand strategic visions.\n\n\nThe second annoying thing was more serious. Money. Woodhull was fanatical about getting his expenses reimbursed. Amazingly, for someone so strident about every other aspect of his security, Woodhull kept a cash book notated with the costs incurred by his espionage: travel, lodging, and food, mostly. Though no doubt he kept it safely hidden, maintaining an itemized ledger was, of course, a major breach of the regulations. In one respect, however, it was a necessity: Woodhull, as he often pointed out, was not wealthy, his expenses were considerable, and hard cash was difficult to come by.\n\n\nThese were agents who worked for wages, and whose loyalty was always in doubt.\n\n\nIt was to these characters that Napoleon, always a shrewd judge of character, alluded in his dictum: that the only true reward for a spy was gold.\n\n\nA Culper letter of mid-January was days late owing to a dragoon’s lame horse and his need to “get some repairs to his accoutrements.”\n\n\nFor Americans, over the course of the war their fleet of congressionally approved privateers—which varied between 73 (in 1777) and 449 (1781)—brought in 3,100 merchant vessels, of which 900 were eventually recaptured or ransomed to their owners.

For us who grew up in Israel, it was the first non-consensus war, the first war that obviously was a war of choice: Israel was not attacked, Israel attacked.\n\n\nEven the first Zionist settlers when they came and realized that what they thought was an empty land, or at least their own land, was full of Arab people, they regarded these people as aliens, as violent aliens who took over their land.\n\n\nso-called Palestinian terrorism that in the Israeli perspective and in some Western perspectives comes out of the blue: We don’t know why these people are violent, maybe it is because they are Muslims, maybe it is their political culture.\n\n\nand constructing Israeli settlements there. The norm in Gaza was described in detail by the heroic Norwegian trauma surgeon Mads Gilbert, who has worked in Gazas main hospital through Israel’s most grotesque crimes and returned again for the current onslaught.\n\n\n*Weisglass added that Gazans would remain on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger\n\n\nIn reality, Hamas leaders have repeatedly made it clear that Hamas would accept a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus that has been blocked by the United States and Israel for forty years. In contrast, Israel is dedicated to the destruction of Palestine, apart from some occasional meaningless words, and is implementing that commitment.\n\n\nIsraeli officials laud the humanity of what it calls the most moral army in the world, which informs residents that their homes will be bombed.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/Churchill":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/Churchill","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Europe/Churchill.md","title":"Churchill","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","history","history/military","history/british","biography"],"content":"Churchill\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis is the penultimate biography of Churchill. It develops quite deeply into Churchill, the man, the adventurer and the statesman. It needed over 1000 pages, and probably more could have been written.\n🎨 Impressions\nGreat men gather divisive\nChurchill was an imperialist, leave no doubt about that. He lived for the British empire.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIn the courageous and often lonely stands he was to take against the twin totalitarian threats of Fascism and Communism, he cared far more for what he imagined would have been the good opinion of his fallen comrades of the Great War than for what was said by his living colleagues on the benches of the House of Commons.\n\n\n‘We shape our buildings,’ Winston Churchill was later to say, ‘and afterwards our buildings shape us.’\n\n\nLike a true aristocrat, he was no snob. ‘What is the sense of being against a man simply because of his birth?’ he wanted to ask Adolf Hitler of the Jews.\n\n\nChurchill’s next political memory was the death of Disraeli in April 1881, when he was six. ‘I followed his illness from day to day with great anxiety,’ he recalled, ‘because everyone said what a loss he would be to his country and how no one else could stop Mr Gladstone from working his wicked will upon us all.’\n\n\nAt this distance of time it is impossible to tell whether Churchill’s bad behaviour had genuinely warranted punishment, or whether Sneyd-Kinnersley’s craving to hurt children was more to blame, but before Churchill was ten years old the beatings had so damaged his health that his parents took him away from St George’s and sent him to a far kinder school in Hove, run by two sisters both called Miss Thomson.\n\n\nHe had earlier opposed Gladstone’s bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 as too much of a ‘Forward’ imperialist policy, yet only four years later he went further.\n\n\nLord Randolph meanwhile, when he was not in the Commons or the Carlton Club, spent a good deal of time in Paris, where people presumed he was womanizing. ‘Tell Mary she is a fool not to forgive Billy,’ he once wrote to Jennie about two of their friends. ‘What does one occasional cook or housemaid matter?’\n\n\nAsked what he intended to do as a profession, he replied, ‘The Army, of course, so long as there’s any fighting to be had. When that’s over, I shall have a shot at politics.’\n\n\n‘I am always ready to learn,’ Churchill was to say in 1952, ‘although I do not always like being taught.’\n\n\nHer hypocrisy can be measured precisely: in the seven years from 1885 to 1892, Churchill wrote to his parents seventy-six times; they to him six times. The huge majority of Churchill’s letters were not asking for anything, except, between the lines, for love and attention.\n\n\nWhen the seventeen-year-old Churchill tried to get out of being sent to a French family to learn French over Christmas 1891, Jennie wrote, ‘I have only read one page of your letter and I send it back to you as its style does not please me.’\n\n\n‘My father with his experience and flair had discerned in me the qualities of military genius.’ He continued in this delusion for several years, until he was told that his father had in fact merely thought he was not clever enough to become a barrister, let alone a help in his political career.\n\n\n‘A medal glitters,’ he once wrote, ‘but it also casts a shadow.’\n\n\n‘To understand a man,’ Napoleon once said, ‘look at the world when he was twenty.’\n\n\nAs long as the individual’s commanding officer agreed and his military duties were not impaired, officers were permitted to write about campaigns for the newspapers, although it was not actively encouraged.\n\n\nThe key was the ‘noble’ English sentence. Once Churchill had discovered that he was capable of writing vividly to the right length under tight deadlines in war zones, he demanded ever higher rates and within five years he was the world’s best-paid war correspondent.\n\n\nHave never seen his like,’ Churchill wrote in the early 1930s, ‘or in some respects his equal … He was pacifist, individualist, democrat, capitalist and a “Gold-Bug” ’ (advocate of the Gold Standard).\n\n\nWas not true, as Lord Mountbatten was later to claim, that ‘He left Cuba with three great predilections for the whole of his life – active service, siestas, and cigars.’\n\n\nIt was in Bangalore that he learned to admire what he later called the ‘great work that England was doing in India and of her high mission to rule these primitive but agreeable races for their welfare and our own’.\n\n\nToday, of course, we know imperialism and colonialism to be evil and exploitative concepts, but Churchill’s first-hand experience of the British Raj did not strike him that way. He admired the way the British had brought internal peace for the first time in Indian history, as well as railways, vast irrigation projects, mass education, newspapers, the possibilities for extensive international trade, standardized units of exchange, bridges, roads, aqueducts, docks, universities, an uncorrupt legal system, medical advances, anti-famine coordination, the English language as the first national lingua franca, telegraphic communications and military protection from the Russian, French, Afghan, Afridi and other outside threats, while also abolishing suttee (the practice of burning widows on funeral pyres), thugee (the ritualized murder of travellers) and other abuses.\n\n\nThere would not be much satisfaction in being styled “Your Insignificance” or “Your Squalidity”.’\n\n\nThroughout his life he enjoyed depicting himself as a heavy drinker, but it is remarkable on how few occasions anybody else thought him to have been drunk.\n\n\nYet it is extraordinary how many of his greatest Second World War speeches conform to each of the five elements of this seminal essay, written more than forty years earlier. Well-chosen words; carefully crafted sentences; accumulation of argument; use of analogy; deployment of extravagances: those were the five scaffolds of the rhetoric of the greatest orator of his age.\n\n\n‘Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.’\n\n\nHe believed their insistence on a rigid form of Islam kept the Afghan people in ‘the grip of miserable superstition’.\n\n\nIslam, he further stated, increases, instead of lessening, the fury of intolerance. It was originally propagated by the sword, and ever since its votaries have been subject, above the people of all other creeds, to this form of madness. In a moment the fruits of patient toil, the prospects of material prosperity, the fear of death itself, are flung aside. The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist. All rational considerations are forgotten. Seizing their weapons, they become Ghazis [anti-infidel fanatics] – as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs: fit only to be treated as such.\n\n\nChurchill saw Islamic fundamentalism up close. It was a form of fanaticism that in many key features – its sheer implacability, contempt for Christianity, opposition to liberal Western values, addiction to violence, demand for total allegiance and so on – was not unlike the political fanaticism that he was to encounter forty years later.\n\n\nIt is said that most first novels are at least partly autobiographical,\n\n\n‘A European war can only end in the ruin of the vanquished and the scarcely less fatal commercial dislocation and exhaustion of the conquerors. Democracy is more vindictive than Cabinets. The wars of peoples will be more terrible than those of kings.’\n\n\nIvor Guest opined that ‘Few fathers had done less for their sons. Few sons have done more for their fathers.’\n\n\nChurchill nonetheless ensured that Britain retained control of large tribal areas such as Basutoland (modern-day Lesotho), Bechuanaland (Botswana) and Swaziland (eSwatini), where the native populations were treated in a more benevolent fashion than they had been by the Boers.\n\n\nMore than 50,000 Chinese workers who were being exploited by mine-owners in South Africa to such an extent that several Liberal newspapers and politicians freely used the term ‘Chinese slavery’.\n\n\nDespite his insistence that it not be called slavery, Churchill unequivocally denounced the treatment of the Chinese workforce in South Africa, calling it ‘as degrading, hideous, and pathetic as any this civilized and Christian nation has made itself responsible for in modern years’.\n\n\nHaving met the Kaiser in 1906, and again in 1909, helped guard him against the mistake made by a number of British politicians, of thinking that Adolf Hitler was simply another version of the petulant Emperor.\n\n\n‘Winston is full of the poor, whom he has just discovered,’ Masterman wrote to his wife Lucy at this time. ‘He thinks he is called by Providence to do something for them.’\n\n\nLloyd George supposedly told the Mastermans that he had asked Churchill whether Diana was a pretty child. ‘ “The prettiest child ever seen,” said Winston beaming. “Like her mother, I suppose?” “No,” said Winston still more gravely, “she is exactly like me.”\n\n\nWhitehall wags put it, McKenna wanted six dreadnoughts, Lloyd George and Churchill wanted four, so the Government compromised on eight.\n\n\nNearly all the cases of murder are a combination of love and drink.’\n\n\n‘Winston thinks with his mouth,’ meaning that he adopted policies because they sounded good in speeches.\n\n\nMuch of the strength of his reputation in the period up to 1940 rested on the fact that he had ‘got the Navy ready’ for the outbreak of the Great War. Yet in the process he also made powerful enemies in an institution with intimate ties to the Conservative Party and much influence throughout the Establishment.\n\n\nIn June 1912, Churchill asked Fisher to return to the Admiralty as his most senior adviser. ‘You need a plough to draw,’ he told him, mixing his metaphors magnificently. ‘Your propellers are racing in air.’\n\n\nTo the diehards who complained about his violating naval traditions, he is said to have rejoined, ‘Naval tradition? Naval tradition? Monstrous. Nothing but rum, sodomy, prayers, and the lash.’ (When this famous list is cited, prayers are sometimes omitted.\n\n\nAlthough there was in fact no chance whatever that an independent Ireland would remain loyal to the Crown in the long run, Churchill’s mind was starting to move along the lines that were to climax with his suggestion of joint Anglo-American citizenship at Harvard in 1943.\n\nIn fact, male suffragists gave more trouble than Irish Loyalists, and ‘Winston threatened to smash the face of one of the male tormentors who forced his way into their compartment on the train.’\n\n\n\n‘The question seems no longer to be “Should women have votes?” but “Ought women not to be abolished altogether?”\n\n\nUnfortunately, the very next day her husband sounded exactly like the kind of person she had been satirizing, telling Sir George Riddell, ‘The truth is that we have enough ignorant voters and we don’t need any more.’\n\n\nThe rift between the parties was deepened in the summer of 1912 by the revelation that Lloyd George, still chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Rufus Isaacs, the Attorney-General, had bought shares in the American Marconi Company without declaring them for a full four months after telling the Commons that they did not have shares in its sister-company, the British Marconi Company, where Isaacs’s brother was managing director.\n\n\nAsked if he would rejoin the Tories, he said, ‘No, certainly not! On no account. I am a Free Trader, and quite out of sympathy with their attitude to the working classes.’\n\n\nAfter dinner at the Admiralty, Churchill was asked by a French naval delegation if they could have another naval base in the Mediterranean. ‘Use Malta as if it were Toulon,’ came the reply.\n\n\nCriticism is always advantageous. I have derived continued benefit from criticism at all periods of my life, and I do not remember any time when I was ever short of it. Churchill, House of Commons, November 19142 Churchill embarked on the Great War like a dynamo.\n\n\nOne of the soldiers who fought at Gallipoli, a thirty-two-year-old Captain Clement Attlee of the South Lancashire Regiment, believed all his life that, as he put it, ‘the strategic conception was sound’.\n\n\nFisher sent the Prime Minister a long list of conditions, including the removal of HMS Queen Elizabeth from the Dardanelles and Churchill from the Admiralty, adding that the First Lord was ‘a bigger danger than the Germans’.\n\n\nKitchener, who had not been involved in the machinations to remove him, told Churchill ‘in the impressive and almost majestic manner that was natural to him, “Well, there is one thing at any rate they cannot take from you. The Fleet was ready.”\n\n\nWhen in the Second World War an MP disgraced himself, Churchill suggested that he join a bomb-disposal unit as the best way of regaining people’s regard.\n\n\nAttlee was convinced that the Dardanelles strategy had been a bold and correct one, which, in the view of one of his biographers, ‘gave him his lifelong admiration for Churchill as a military strategist which contributed enormously to their working relationship in the Second World War’.\n\n\nCaptain Clement Attlee of the 6th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment, became the last man but one to leave Suvla Bay.\n\n\nOn 17 January, Churchill and Jack Seely attended a lecture for senior officers on the lessons of the Battle of Loos. Afterwards the organizers asked what was the lesson of the lecture. ‘I restrained an impulse to reply “Don’t do it again,” ’ Churchill told Clementine. ‘But they will – I have no doubt.’\n\n\n‘It was found that if a man was put in front of Winston for some misdemeanour he would ask them if they had fought at Loos,’ Gibb noticed. ‘If the answer was in the affirmative the Colonel would dismiss the charge. Inevitably, word got around and before long everyone in the battalion claimed to have fought at Loos.’\n\n\nEarly February saw another lucky escape when a shell exploded ‘at no great distance’ from him while lunching at Laurence Farm with Archie Sinclair and others.\n\n\nWhen the new Government was announced, The Times reported that it had learned ‘with relief and satisfaction that Mr Churchill will not be offered any post in the new administration’.\n\n\n‘A fifth of the resources, the effort, the loyalty, the resolution, the perseverance vainly employed in the battle of the Somme to gain a few shattered villages and a few square miles of devastated ground’, he told the Inquiry, ‘would in the Gallipoli Peninsula, used in time, have united the Balkans on our side, joined hands with Russia, and cut Turkey out of the war.’\n\n\n‘Of all the tyrannies in history, the Bolshevik tyranny is the worst,’ Churchill said shortly after the war,\n\n\n‘My hatred of Bolshevism and Bolsheviks is not founded on their silly system of economics, or their absurd doctrine of an impossible equality. It arises from the bloody and devastating terrorism which they practise in every land into which they have broken, and by which alone their criminal regime can be maintained.’\n\n\nOne in ten British men between the ages of twenty and forty-five had died in the war, some 744,000, as well as 14,600 merchant seamen, and 1,000 civilians. A further 150,000 Britons died of Spanish influenza that winter. Against such a background, any fresh military commitments were not going to be popular.\n\n\nAs soon as the war ended, Churchill immediately set about writing The World Crisis. It was to be packed with lessons for the future. ‘No war is so sanguinary as the war of exhaustion,’ he wrote. ‘No plan could be more unpromising than the plan of frontal attack. Yet on these two brutal expedients the military authorities of France and Britain consumed, during three successive years, the flower of their national manhood.’\n\n\nWhen Churchill told the Cabinet in August that ‘militarily, we are in a good position to fight the Triple Alliance,’ it was not a troika of foreign enemy powers he was talking about, but the mining, railway and dock trade unions.\n\n\n‘What a magnificent body of men, and never to look forward to another drink!’\n\n\n‘One might as well legalize sodomy as recognize the Bolsheviks.’\n\n\nChurchill described Bolshevism as ‘That foul combination of criminality and animalism’.\n\n\n‘Bolshevism is not a policy,’ he said in a speech on 29 May; ‘it is a disease. It is not a creed; it is a pestilence. It presents all the characteristics of a pestilence. It breaks out with great suddenness; it is violently contagious; it throws people into a frenzy of excitement; it spreads with extraordinary rapidity; the mortality is terrible.’\n\n\n‘But Winston in those days could be very irritating, in fact his stenographer [at the War Office] … got so exasperated with him that she threw her shorthand-book at him. Needless to say she got the sack.’\n\n\nThe Whites committed anti-Semitic pogroms quite as often as the Reds, and Churchill tried to make the military aid contingent upon Denikin ‘preventing by every possible means the ill-treatment of the innocent Jewish population’.\n\n\nAt the time there were 80,000 Jews in Palestine and 600,000 Arabs, so any possibility of such a Jewish homeland there seemed a long way off.\n\n\nAlthough he also wanted to establish a homeland in northern Iraq for the Kurds – ‘to protect the Kurds from some future bully in Iraq’, as he put it – that plan was overruled by the Foreign Office.\n\n\nThey stopped at Gaza, where a Palestinian mob cheered Churchill and Great Britain. As Coote recorded, ‘Their chief cry over which they waxed quite frenzied was “Down with the Jews”, “Cut their throats”\n\n\nThat August, Collins was killed in an ambush by anti-Treaty forces. Shortly before his death he had told a friend who was going to London, ‘Tell Winston that we could never have done anything without him.’\n\n\nBalfour said it was ‘Winston’s brilliant autobiography, disguised as a history of the universe\n\n\n‘My father had very strong views about no animal being slaughtered for food once he had said “Good morning” to it.’ Of a particular goose he said, ‘You carve, Clemmie. He was a friend of mine.’\n\n\n‘What a swine this Mussolini is,’ Churchill wrote to Clementine in September 1923.\n\n\nLord Randolph Churchill had been an undistinguished chancellor of the Exchequer, who referred to decimal points as ‘those damned dots’. Economics was not his son’s forte either\n\n\nIn 1945, Churchill admitted privately, ‘The biggest blunder of my life was the return to the Gold Standard.’\n\n\n‘Fancy cutting down those beautiful trees we saw this afternoon’, Churchill said outside Quebec, ‘to make pulp for those bloody newspapers, and calling it Civilization.’\n\n\n‘Cultured people’, his father replied, ‘are merely the glittering scum which floats upon the deep river of production.’\n\n\n‘We realize one hundred million pounds sterling a year from our liquor taxes,’ Churchill told the Appleton Post-Crescent newspaper, ‘which I understand you give to your bootleggers.’\n\n\nMayo’s paeans to the ways the British were attempting to educate the Untouchables, prevent cruelty to animals and improve medicine – all worthy projects regularly stymied by Hindu religious leaders – increased Churchill’s antipathy to Indian independence.\n\n\nIn late August he almost met Hitler in Munich, when the Nazi Party publicist, Harvard-educated Ernst ‘Putzi’ Hanfstaengl, tried to arrange an encounter between the two men. ‘Herr Hitler,’ Hanfstaengl said to his leader in his apartment, ‘don’t you realize the Churchills are sitting in the restaurant? … They are expecting you for coffee and will think this a deliberate insult.’ Hitler was unshaven and had too much to do. ‘What on earth would I talk to him about?’ he asked. It probably would not have been a very fruitful conversation, as Churchill sent an oral message via Hanfstaengl: ‘Tell your boss from me that anti-Semitism may be a good starter, but it is a bad sticker.’\n\n\n‘I remember the tears pouring down his cheeks one day before the war in the House of Commons,’ Attlee recalled many years later, ‘when he was telling me what was being done to the Jews in Germany.’\n\n\n‘Herr Hitler, whatever one may think of his methods,’ opined The Times, ‘is genuinely trying to transform revolutionary fervour into moderate and constructive effort and to impose a high standard of public service on National-Socialist officials.’\n\n\n‘If there is going to be war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister.’\n\n\n‘Those who have met Herr Hitler face to face in public business or on social terms have found a highly competent, cool, well-informed functionary with an agreeable manner, a disarming smile, and few have been unaffected by a subtle personal magnetism\n\n\nChurchill said exasperatedly to his son, ‘Randolph, do not interrupt me while I’m interrupting.’\n\n\nBecause of this changed stance, Churchill was no longer seen as an enemy in Russia and his effigy was discreetly taken down from the shooting gallery in Moscow’s Park of Culture and Rest.\n\n\n‘The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when nations are strong they are not always just, and when they wish to be just they are often no longer strong,’\n\n\nOne of the reasons why Churchill became prime minister in 1940 was that, although few had heeded his speeches, many others remembered that he had made them.\n\n\nChurchill asked Bernstorff how to prevent a second German war. ‘Overwhelming encirclement,’ he replied.\n\n\nOne of the minor changes he suggested to Lawrence of Arabia was that ‘You can hardly talk of arousing the Arabs to a Crusade, which were things instituted to do them in. Jehad is the real word.’\n\n\nChurchill made it clear that the Palestinian Arabs’ decision to take up arms for their imperial masters the Turks and refusal to participate in the Arab Revolt had destroyed any sympathy he might have had for them. ‘These Arabs were a poor people, conquered, living under the Turks fairly well,’\n\n\n‘Of course, you are ambassador and your words have to be taken cum grano salis [with a pinch of salt].’\n\n\nThe idea that Churchill might be genuinely motivated by conviction seems not to have occurred to Chamberlain, who tended to see politics in intensely personal terms, a trait that was ultimately to lead to his downfall.\n\n\nThe extra year that Munich ‘bought’ for peace was put to good use by Germany; one-third of the tanks used in the invasion of France were of Czech manufacture.\n\n\n‘How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.’\n\n\nChurchill said, ‘Alexander the Great remarked that the people of Asia were slaves because they had not learned to pronounce the word “No”. Let that not be the epitaph of the English-speaking peoples or of Parliamentary democracy, or of France, or of the many surviving liberal states of Europe.’\n\n\nIn fact the campaign the Nazis unleashed that very night – known to history as Kristallnacht – was against the Jews. Eight thousand Jewish shops and 1,688 synagogues were ransacked, 267 synagogues were burned down, nearly a hundred Jews murdered, thousands beaten up and 30,000 sent to concentration camps.\n\n\nThere is a fascinating dichotomy in that, although the appeasement movement was intended to prevent another war breaking out, most of its leaders had not seen action in the Great War, whereas most of the anti-appeasers had.\n\n\n‘If Franco won, his Nazi backers would drive him to the same kind of brutal suppressions as are practised in the totalitarian states.’ Franco did not need Hitler’s encouragement to massacre up to 100,000 of his Republican enemies when he duly won in March 1939.\n\n\nChurchill had discovered beyond doubt how fundamentally unsound the ex-King was about the Nazis. He remained respectful throughout this ‘prolonged argument’, but did point out to him that ‘When our kings are in conflict with our constitution, we change our kings.’\n\n\nOn 30 January in the Reichstag, Hitler described Churchill, Duff Cooper and Eden as ‘apostles of war’. He also openly promised ‘the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe’ should war break out.\n\n\nSupposing (as I do not for one moment suppose) that Mr Kennedy were correct in his most tragic utterance, then I for one would willingly lay down my life in combat, rather than, in fear of defeat, surrender to the menaces of these most sinister men.\n\n\nChurchill’s ‘face had ceased smiling’, Spears recalled, ‘and the shake of his head was ominous when he observed … that it would be very unwise to think the Ardennes were impassable to strong forces … “Remember,” he said, “that we are faced with a new weapon, armour in great strength, on which the Germans are no doubt concentrating, and that forests will be particularly tempting to such forces since they will offer concealment from the air.” ’ The French disbelief that any such attack was possible reminded Spears of an occasion in 1915 when Churchill had tried to explain his theory of ‘land cruisers’ (that is, tanks) to a French general, who found it absurd, and who, after he had left, said to Spears, ‘Your politicians are even funnier than ours.’\n\n\nWhen Corbin tried to speak of ‘technical difficulties’ in declaring war, Churchill retorted, ‘I suppose you would call it a technical difficulty for a Pole if a German bomb fell on his head!’\n\n\nChamberlain wrote to Ida from Chequers, ‘What I hope for is not a military victory – I very much doubt the possibility of that – but a collapse of the German home front.’ It was hardly the right mentality for the man who was leading Britain into war.\n\n\nHe told the Admiralty that he would be arriving later in the afternoon to take up his office, whereupon the Board signalled to the Fleet: ‘WINSTON IS BACK’. Some captains, such as Lord Louis Mountbatten commanding the destroyer HMS Kelly, found the message inspirational, while others took it more in the nature of a warning that a ball of energy was about to burst upon them.\n\n\nAs soon as he assumed office, Churchill began to write regular letters to Chamberlain, thirteen in the first six weeks, covering every aspect of the war, which as a member of the War Cabinet he had every right to do. Chamberlain complained of their length, and said, ‘Of course I realize that the letters are for the purpose of quotation in the book that he will write hereafter.’\n\n\nThe height of absurdity in what was called the Phoney War – the eight-month period after the war started but before any fighting began between the British and Germans on land – came when the RAF was prevented from bombing targets in the Black Forest because so much of it was private property.\n\n\n‘Russia has pursued a cold policy of self-interest,’ Churchill said, and he freely admitted, ‘I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma: but perhaps there is a key.\n\n\nWhen it was suggested that Randolph didn’t have enough money to marry, Churchill shot back, ‘What do they need? Cigars, champagne and a double bed.’\n\n\n‘I haven’t the slightest doubt that he’s marrying because he thinks it’s time and right that Winston must have a grandson.\n\n\n‘There are two people who sink U-boats in this war, Talbot,’ he said. ‘You sink them in the Atlantic and I sink them in the House of Commons. The trouble is that you are sinking them at exactly half the rate I am.’\n\n\n‘Is everything you tell us true?’ a young rating asked Churchill on board a battleship in 1940. ‘Young man,’ Churchill replied, ‘I have told many lies for my country and will tell many more.’\n\n\nChurchill quipped to Jock Colville, then Chamberlain’s private secretary, ‘If I were the first of May, I should be ashamed of myself.’ Colville, who at this time admired Chamberlain and was sceptical about Churchill, acidly recorded in his diary, ‘Personally I think he ought to be ashamed of himself in any case.’\n\n\nDespite the litany of errors, there were some consolations from the Norway campaign. Whereas the Royal Navy had lost an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, a sloop and nine destroyers, Germany had lost three cruisers, and ten of her twenty-two destroyers and her only two operational battleships were damaged, much greater losses proportionately to the size of her navy than Britain’s. An intact German Navy fighting off Dunkirk the following month could have been a decisive force, but in early May the Germans had only one large cruiser, two light cruisers and seven destroyers ready for immediate service, not enough even to come out of port.\n\n\nThe men of destiny do not wait to be sent for; they come when they feel their time has come. They do not ask to be recognized, they declare themselves; they come like fate; they are inevitable.\n\n\nChamberlain soldiered on through a long, self-exculpatory and uninspiring defence of his Government and himself. ‘I do not think that the people of this country yet realize the extent or the imminence of the threat which is impending against us,’ he said, whereupon one MP called out, ‘We said that five years ago!’\n\n\nThe time-honoured practice of throwing loyal colleagues to the wolves having failed, Chamberlain called Halifax over to No. 10 at 10.15 a.m., without telling him that Amery had been offered his job.\n\n\nHis hero Napoleon believed that success was its own justification. In the idiom of the day, Churchill had ‘form’ in pushing for office going back thirty years, so why should it be any different with the highest office, which he had coveted for even longer?\n\n\nChurchill admired Attlee’s authority, helpfulness, dispatch and lack of opportunism; he remembered it for years and it sealed the respect he had for him.\n\n\nTo explain the rapid rout of the massive French Ninth Army, one of Gamelin’s staff officers pointed out that the figures given for ‘mobilized’ men had included large numbers of postmen, railway workers and municipal employees who had been carrying on their civilian duties and had been mobilized only on paper, leaving Churchill further aghast.\n\n\nHe had not appreciated the extent to which the losses of the Great War and the social and political crises of the 1930s had sapped military morale.\n\n\nWhen Italian ciphers were broken in July 1941. The Bletchley code-breakers – as many as 10,000 men and women by the end of the war – were, as Churchill put it, ‘the geese who laid the golden eggs’ and who, just as importantly, ‘never cackled’.\n\n\nDuring the militarily disastrous Black Week in the Boer War, Queen Victoria had said, ‘We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat; they do not exist.’ Churchill had three copies of that quotation made, which he now placed along the Cabinet table.\n\n\nHe said that if he did ever have to make such a speech, it would end with the words: ‘The hour has come; kill the Hun. He also intended to use the phrase, ‘You can always take one with you.’\n\n\nOn 30 May, he told Gort that once no further organized resistance was possible at Dunkirk he was ordered to ‘capitulate formally and to avoid useless slaughter\n\n\nMussolini declared war on Britain and France on 10 June. When Colville woke Churchill from his afternoon nap to give him the news, the Prime Minister growled, ‘People who go to Italy to look at ruins won’t have to go as far as Naples and Pompeii in future.’\n\n\nThis decision not to commit the remainder of British air forces to France, despite overweening pressure from his ally and his own Francophilia, was one of the most critical judgements he ever made.\n\n\nChamberlain went to update the King on ‘what is being done to his Empire’, and the tricolour was flown over Westminster Abbey for the only time in history. ‘Who knows,’ Colville joked, ‘we may yet see the “fleurs de lys” restored to the Royal Standard!’  He thought the new country might be called ‘Frangland\n\n\n‘He had to be rude to the British in order to prove to French eyes that he was not a British puppet,’ he wrote.\n\n\nFor all her insight and moderating tendencies, Clementine could sometimes be very tart herself. Colville observed that she ‘considers it one of her missions in life to put people in their place and prides herself on being outspoken’.\n\n\n‘Up til April they were so sure the Allies would win that they did not think help necessary,’ Churchill told Lothian in Washington. ‘Now they are so sure we shall lose that they do not think it possible\n\n\nIn a paraphrase of another remark of Queen Victoria’s in Black Week during in the Boer War, he ended, ‘No one is downhearted here.’ Despite all the setbacks of recent days, his determination was unaffected.\n\n\nChurchill exploded and ‘told him if he did not mind his own business he would perhaps have no business to mind!’\n\n\nCabinet set up the Special Operations Executive, or SOE, after weeks of inter-departmental wrangling, ‘to coordinate all action, by way of subversion and sabotage, against the enemy’. ‘And now,’ Churchill told Hugh Dalton, its first director, ‘go and set Europe ablaze!’ Churchill disliked Dalton personally, but thought him effective, and approvingly dubbed him ‘the Minister for Ungentlemanly Warfare’.\n\n\nBy total contrast with Churchill, Hitler virtually stopped making broadcasts once the war started going badly. During the whole of 1944, for example, he spoke on German radio only once.\n\n\nIt was hard to see how British strategic interests were served by aiding Greece, but on being informed that Athens had been bombed Churchill replied without hesitation, ‘Then we must bomb Rome.’ (‘Rome will not be unbuilt in a day,’ he told a Tory MP.\n\n\nWith Roosevelt safely re-elected, Churchill sent him a telegram on 16 November that he later described as ‘one of the most important I ever wrote’, asking for arms to be lent or leased to Britain under a programme whereby Britain would repay the United States over the very long term. (Even he would probably not have guessed that the final instalment of the loan, of $83.25 million, would only be repaid in 2006.\n\n\nCripps could not be moved from Moscow as ‘He is a lunatic in a country of lunatics, and it would be a pity to move him.’\n\n\nChurchill told the Chiefs of Staff, ‘Prince Paul’s attitude looks like that of an unfortunate man in a cage with a tiger, hoping not to provoke him while steadily dinner-time approaches.’\n\n\nSmoking a cigar that he relit at least ten times, and drinking ‘quite a lot of port and brandy’, he pointed out that the Germans had rejected Hitler twice in free elections, the second time by a bigger majority than the first. Eade was impressed by the informality of the lunch.\n\n\nDiscussing scientific matters, probably for Conant’s benefit, Churchill asked the Prof why, if it ‘is constantly halving itself, is there any uranium left on earth?’\n\n\nHe was right; the destruction of Poland at the hands of both the Nazis and Soviets was cataclysmic. Between 1939 and 1945, the population of Poland declined by 17.2 percent, more than that of any other European country.\n\n\nHitler’s secretary, Christa Schroeder, recalled that ‘emotion would take over’ when he dictated to her about three subjects – Roosevelt, Churchill and Bolshevism. ‘His voice often skipped over bits’ as a result. ‘Then his choice of words would not be so fussy,’ she wrote.\n\n\nChurchill told Prytz that the knob of butter was ‘the impending clash between the U.S.S.R. and Germany’. In that event, he said, ‘To crush Germany I am prepared to enter into an alliance with anyone, even the Devil!’\n\n\nYet Churchill’s view ‘was that Russia was now at war; innocent peasants were being slaughtered; and we should forget about Soviet systems or the Comintern and extend our hand to fellow human beings in distress’. Colville recalled that this argument ‘was extremely vehement’.\n\n\nChurchill said that after victory ‘There should be an end to all bloodshed, though he should like to see Mussolini, the bogus mimic of Ancient Rome, strangled like Vercingetorix in old Roman fashion.’ Hitler and the leading Nazis would be sent to a remote island, though not St Helena, as that would ‘desecrate’ Napoleon’s memory.\n\n\nOn the train back to London, Churchill asked for a Benedictine liqueur, and ten minutes later for a brandy. Reminded by the attendant that he had already had a Benedictine, he said, ‘I know; I want some brandy to clear it up.’\n\n\nBritain had sent 720 ships to the Soviet Union in forty convoys, and had delivered over four million tons of supplies, 5,000 tanks and 7,000 aircraft. These convoys diverted fleets that would otherwise have been used to protect home waters or Atlantic convoys.\n\n\nBy the end of the war, Britain had sent 720 ships to the Soviet Union in forty convoys, and had delivered over four million tons of supplies, 5,000 tanks and 7,000 aircraft.\n\n\nOn 25 August, with the Germans outside Kiev, Britain and Russia jointly invaded Iran with a small force. They were victorious in three days, and the Shah’s son was installed in his father’s place on the Peacock Throne. Britain was now able to supply Russia by land, and to protect the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Abadan oilfields. ‘We had been doing something for which we had justification but no right,’ Churchill admitted privately.\n\n\nChurchill told Colville that ‘So far the Government had only made one error of judgment: Greece.’ He now blamed that campaign on Sir John Dill. Colville knew that the Greek campaign had in fact been Churchill’s idea and that Dill had initially opposed it, but the Prime Minister ‘has now got his knife right into Dill and frequently disparages him’.\n\n\nThe following day Churchill made light of the criticisms, telling his fellow MPs, ‘There was a custom in Imperial China that anyone who wished to criticize the Government had the right to … and, provided he followed that up by committing suicide, very great respect was paid to his words, and no ulterior motive was assigned. That seems to me to have been, from many points of view, a wise custom, but I certainly would be the last to suggest that it should be made retrospective.’\n\n\nThe ‘Fighting Brookes’ of Colebrooke and Fermanagh had served in the British Army since the English Civil War: no fewer than twenty-six of them had fought in the Great War and twenty-seven would fight in the Second World War.\n\n\nHe was to tell Moran that ‘every month’ of working with Churchill ‘is a year off my life’.\n\n\nChurchill went on to say, ‘To me the best tidings of all is that the United States, united as never before, have drawn the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard.’\n\n\nBy the end of 1941, Britain was spending more than half her Gross Domestic Product on the war, but that was soon to be dwarfed by the American contribution. In 1940, the United States produced less than half the amount of munitions produced by the United Kingdom, in 1941 it was two-thirds, in 1942 twice as much, in 1943 nearly thrice and in 1944 almost four times the amount.\n\n\nAsked why Canada had not expelled the Vichy Ambassador, he replied, ‘A courtyard likes to have a window.’ Of Rudolf Hess he said, ‘He tells us that Hitler loves England and that his heart would bleed for us if Germany had to invade Great Britain.’ He played it carefully when asked whether it was vital to the war effort that Roosevelt remained president, saying, ‘After a long experience of public life I have come to the conclusion that very few understand the politics of their own country – and none the politics of other countries\n\n\nGandhi was fortunate that it was the Viceroy who ruled India rather than Hitler; the Führer’s advice to Lord Halifax when they met at Berchtesgaden in 1937 had been ‘Shoot Gandhi.’\n\n\nThat day starving Malta, which had endured her thousandth air raid the previous December, was finally reached by two merchantmen, the Talabot and the Pampas, which escaped German bombers and provided supplies that allowed the island to fight on,\n\n\nOn the rare occasions when they used the Annexe air-raid shelter, Pamela slept on the top bunk and Churchill, snoring so powerfully it made the metal bunk-bed shake, slept on the bottom, while Clementine sensibly stayed in her own room.\n\n\nOn 5 May, he wrote of a report from Libya, ‘What is the meaning of the expression “Failed to silence machine-gun posts”? It seems an odd description of an action. Evidently what happened was merely a skirmish. Surely the way to silence machine-guns is to bring up some guns and shell them.’ Brooke, a Royal Artilleryman and acknowledged expert, who was one of the officers credited with inventing the ‘creeping barrage’ in the Great War, did not appreciate being lectured on such matters, not least because he knew Churchill knew that it was impractical always to call up artillery to deal with a troublesome machine gun.\n\n\nAt the War Cabinet meeting on 1 June, however, Pound had to report that a convoy from Iceland to Russia had been very heavily mauled. Of its thirty-five ships, six had been sunk by bombers and one by a U-boat, with the overall loss of 147 tanks, thirty-seven aircraft and 770 vehicles.\n\n\nOn the second day of the debate, Aneurin Bevan, a high-living left-wing Labour MP for whom Bracken coined the phrase ‘Bollinger Bolshevik’, woundingly remarked, ‘The Prime Minister wins debate after debate, and loses battle after battle.\n\n\nThe belief that the Tirpitz, then the largest battleship afloat, was on its way towards the Anglo-American PQ17 convoy, ordered its thirty-five ships to scatter. Pound feared that otherwise Tirpitz ‘would have sunk every single vessel within an hour or so’. Yet the intelligence was wrong, and the Tirpitz was not in the area, whereas German bombers and U-boats were. No fewer than twenty-three vessels, comprising 118,000 out of the convoy’s 200,000 tons of shipping, were sunk. Four hundred tanks and 210 planes went to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nThe Defence Committee cancelled the August convoy, but the September one lost twelve ships out of forty. For the next two years, convoys ran only during the winter months, resulting in fewer losses.\n\n\nEnergetic soldier … If he is disagreeable to those about him, he is also disagreeable to the enemy.’\n\n\nThe discussions, often over tables ‘groaning with food and drink’, were not confined to the war. At one point Churchill asked Stalin what had been his most anxious moment in his career, to which Stalin replied the collectivization of Soviet agriculture. ‘What happened to the kulaks?’ Churchill then asked, of the millions of richer peasants who had been killed during that process. ‘There was not even the flicker of an eyelid,’ Cadogan recalled. ‘He [Stalin] turned and with a nonchalant wave of the hand said, “Oh! They went away.”\n\n\nFlight of ten thousand miles through hostile and foreign skies may be the duty of young pilots,’ the American General Douglas MacArthur, himself a Medal of Honor holder, was to say of Churchill’s London–Moscow journey, ‘but for a statesman burdened with the world’s cares it is an act of inspiring gallantry and valor.’\n\n\nOn 9 September Churchill was informed that the Indian Congress Party would offer only passive resistance should the Japanese invade the sub-continent, and would not help the British to defend it. ‘I hate Indians,’ Churchill apparently told Amery. ‘They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.’\n\n\nChurchill has rightly been castigated for remarks such as these, but the many encomia he paid to the Indian Army – at 2.5 million, the largest all-volunteer army in history – have tended to be ignored, along with the fact that he did continue to protect India with British Army divisions that could have been put to very good use elsewhere. ‘The unsurpassed bravery of Indian soldiers and officers, Moslem and Hindu alike,’ he said, and their ‘glorious heroism’ in campaigns from Abyssinia and North Africa to Burma and Italy, ‘shine forever in the annals of war’.\n\n\nChurchill’s sights were now on Italy. ‘When a nation is thoroughly beaten in war it does all sorts of things which no one can imagine beforehand,’ he told the War Cabinet on 22 November. The Combined Chiefs of Staff were not yet thinking in terms of an Italian mainland campaign, but Churchill was, and had been since his four memoranda of the previous year. He saw it as a way of drawing German resources away from the beaches of north-west France.fn2\n\n\nRoosevelt had grown to loathe de Gaulle for his French chauvinism, his habit of constantly giving priority to French interests over Allied ones and his attempts to sabotage US–Vichy relations. ‘De Gaulle is out to achieve one-man government in France,’ the President told his son Elliott. ‘I can’t imagine a man I would distrust more.’\n\n\nWhen, on another occasion, Bracken said that de Gaulle regarded himself as a reincarnation of St Joan, Churchill growled, ‘Yes, but my bishops won’t burn him!’\n\n\nAll, 793 German U-boats were destroyed or captured in the Second World War; of the nearly 40,000 men who served on them, three-quarters died at sea.\n\n\nThe nonchalance with which Stalin had dismissed the ‘disappearance’ of the kulaks at their meeting in Moscow meant that, however much Churchill may have been shocked, he could not have been entirely surprised. ‘The atrocities by Lenin and Trotsky are incomparably more hideous, on a larger scale, and more numerous than any for which the Kaiser himself is responsible,’ Churchill had written back in 1919. But now their equally brutal successor was a vital ally.\n\n\nWhile Churchill was staying at Roosevelt’s mountain retreat in Maryland, known as Shangri-La (present-day Camp David),\n\n\nA year after the first thousand-bomber raid, on Cologne, Churchill was starting to have doubts about the saturation-bombing policy. He was shown a film at Chequers in late June made by the RAF of the bombing of Wuppertal in Westphalia and asked afterwards, ‘Are we beasts? Are we taking this too far?’\n\n\nHe commissioned a judge, Sir John Singleton, to produce a report on the bombing policy, which eventually called for more of an emphasis on strategic bombing rather than the carpet-bombing of cities. German cities continued to be smashed night after night, however, a campaign that severely restricted the increase in the war-materiel production of the Third Reich, at the total cost of over 55,000 Bomber Command airmen. ‘Even when most ill,’ Doris Miles wrote to her husband of Churchill, ‘he would ring up Bomber Command in the early hours of the morning to find out how many casualties we had (not how many bombs had been dropped) and how many planes had got back safely.’\n\n\nEden characterized the Jewish position as ‘You clear out and we’ll settle with the Arabs.’ Amery added that the Government ‘Can’t be stampeded by Jewish extremists.’ Cranborne argued that the ‘Jews and Arabs were both playing off against us.’ Wavell’s view was that ‘From the point of view of security of the British Empire, the present aspirations of Jews in Palestine are a real menace to our position in the Middle East and subsequently in India.’\n\n\nIn the calendar year 1943, when 70,000 Western servicemen, including bomber crews, died fighting Germany, two million Russian soldiers were killed, nearly thirty times the number.\n\n\nChurchill’s policy of doing everything possible to keep the Soviet Union supplied, even at the inadvertent cost of Singapore, had clearly been the correct one. Yet, as Ian Jacob pointed out in a lecture to the Royal United Services Institute after the war, ‘There was little or no communication of facts or ideas and we had no real idea of Russian military thinking. The fundamental Russian distrust of the West, which was temporarily allayed by the German attack on Russia and our immediate response to it, very soon re-established itself and prevailed throughout. Fortunately, the almost complete geographical separation of the Russian theatre of war mitigated these disadvantages.’\n\n\nAnother quadrupedal gift that year, though this time living, was Rota, a fully grown lion, given by a Mr and Mrs Thompson, which Churchill gave to the London Zoo. ‘If there are any shortcomings in your work I shall send you to him,’ he said to one of his humourless civil servants. ‘Meat is very short now.’ (The man took him seriously and reported that the Prime Minister was ‘in a delirium’.) When Churchill visited Rota at the zoo in August 1943, he also went inside the swan enclosure, telling the swans, ‘I suppose you would like to feed me.’\n\n\nIn July 1943, the Germans had twelve divisions in Italy and the Balkans, which by the end of the year had grown to more than thirty.\n\n\nChurchill held forth on one of his favourite subjects, the many benefits of the British Empire for its native peoples.\n\n\nThe military situation was made all the more difficult by Gandhi’s campaign to force the British to quit India, which he did not end despite the imminent Japanese threat.\n\n\nBy the end of 1944, one million tons of grain had been secured from Australia and the South-East Asia Command, which has led some to conclude that without Churchill the Bengal Famine would actually have been worse. One historian of the famine has concluded that ‘Far from seeking to starve India, Churchill and his Cabinet sought every way to alleviate the suffering without undermining the war effort.’\n\n\nThe next day, Chamberlain’s black cat at No. 10, the Munich Mouser, was found dead in the Foreign Office. ‘Winston says he died of remorse and chose his deathbed accordingly,’ recorded Eden.\n\n\nIn early March, in a ‘benevolent but sombre mood’, he admitted to his guests at Chequers that he was disturbed by Stalin’s attitude over Poland, saying that he felt like telling the Russians, ‘Personally I fight tyranny whatever uniform it wears or slogans it utters.’\n\n\nAt lunch at the Annexe on 1 June, there was an extraordinary series of exchanges between the King, his private secretary and the Prime Minister. In light of the advice of Ramsay and the others, the King said that neither of them should go. Churchill countered that he could not recommend to the Cabinet that the King should go, but that he himself was certainly going. When Lascelles told Churchill that the King would find it hard to find a new prime minister in the midst of a major invasion of France, Churchill replied, ‘Oh, that’s all arranged for,’ presumably referring to the sealed letter that he and the King had written proposing Eden as his successor. Lascelles then argued that constitutionally Churchill could not leave the country without the King’s consent, to which Churchill argued that as he would be on a British ship he would not actually be abroad. Lascelles pointed out that the ship would be outside British territorial waters, so in fact he would be.\n\n\nSeems extraordinary, but even on the eve of D-Day, four years after de Gaulle had set up the Free French in London, the leaders of both Britain and the United States felt such distrust of him. But they detested his French chauvinism and genuinely feared that he might try to turn France into an anti-Western Gaullist dictatorship after the war.\n\n\nThe first of 9,521 V-1  rockets started to land on Britain on 13 June. Nicknamed ‘doodlebugs’ and ‘buzz-bombs’, they forced Churchill back into the Annexe again. On 8 September, the first of around 1,500 V-2 rocket-bombs landed on southern England, continuing until March 1945. Flying at 3,580mph, the V-2 struck without warning with a one-ton payload that could destroy entire streets. Together, the V-1 and V-2 killed 8,938 British civilians and 2,917 servicemen, seriously injured 25,000 people and destroyed 107,000 homes in London and the south-east.\n\n\nThen, referring to the three American Joint Chiefs of Staff, he added, ‘The Arnold–King–Marshall combination is one of the stupidest strategic teams ever seen.’\n\n\nChurchill supported the Jewish Agency’s requests for public exposure of the deportations. ‘I am entirely in accord with making the biggest outcry possible,’ he told Eden. Radio broadcasts were made about Auschwitz, and Hungarian railway workers were warned in Hungarian that they were committing war crimes and would be punished.45 The warnings were repeated by the BBC in October: ‘If these plans are carried out, those guilty of such murderous acts will be brought to justice and will pay the penalty for their heinous crimes.’46 However, the long-range bombing of Auschwitz and its railway lines needed to be done in daylight, and the USAAF, which undertook daylight raids, refused Churchill’s request on 26 June and on several subsequent occasions.\n\n\n‘Unfortunately AE is immovable on the subject of Palestine,’ Anthony Eden’s private secretary Oliver Harvey wrote in his diary in April 1943, for example. ‘He loves Arabs and hates Jews.’\n\n\nMoscow set up a Polish Committee for National Liberation at Lublin in late July, a puppet government in direct opposition to the legitimate Polish Government-in-exile in London. Two days later, the Poles of the Warsaw Home Army, who were loyal to the London Government-in-exile, staged an uprising in the Polish capital against the Wehrmacht garrison, a desperate, sixty-three-day struggle for liberation. By the end, the men were virtually wiped out and the women and children were taken to extermination camps. Stalin halted his forces outside Warsaw to allow the Germans to destroy the Home Army, denouncing the Uprising’s leaders as ‘criminal adventurers’ and refusing to allow Allied aircraft landing rights to resupply them. Churchill contemplated suspending aid convoys to Murmansk in protest, but decided against it. ‘Terrible and even humbling submissions must at times be made to the general aim,’ he later wrote.\n\n\nThe next day, after another difficult meeting, Brooke wrote, ‘I find it hard to remain civil. And the wonderful thing is that three-quarters of the population of the world imagine that Winston Churchill is one of the Strategists of History, a second Marlborough, and the other quarter have no conception what a public menace he is and has been throughout this war! It is far better that the world should never know, and never suspect the feet of clay of that otherwise superhuman being. Without him England was lost for a certainty, with him England has been on the verge of disaster time and again … Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent.’\n\n\nA settlement between the London and the Lublin Poles would be hard to achieve without the active support of the Roosevelt Administration, but it was such a sensitive subject in American politics given the millions of Polish-American voters that an early accord was unlikely, in which case ‘We shall have to hush the matter up and spin it out until after the presidential election.’ That is exactly what happened.\n\n\nOn 24 January 1945, Churchill told Colville that it was half a century since his father’s death. Colville wondered what Lord Randolph, his son Winston and his grandson Randolph all had in common, and decided it was their undeniable ‘capacity for being utterly unreasonable’.\n\n\nWith omnipresent flies and midges, Churchill called Yalta ‘the Riviera of Hades’.\n\n\nGreat pity to stuff the Polish goose so full of German food that it died of indigestion,’ but territory in the west that was ethnically and historically German was nonetheless added to Poland, and remains there to this day. By 1950, between twelve and fourteen million Germans had moved from those historically German territories to lands behind the new German border, the largest movement of people in modern European history.\n\n\nBetween 18 May and 2 June 1945, the 1st Guards Brigade, part of the British V Corps that occupied Carinthia, the southern province of Austria, and several other British units handed over some 40,000 anti-Soviet Cossacks to the Red Army, including many who were not Soviet citizens and never had been. Similarly, though in this case there was no treaty obligation to do so, 30,000 Yugoslavs who had fought against Marshal Tito were sent to him. Most of these Cossacks and Yugoslavs were liquidated on arrival; the rest were incarcerated and cruelly punished for years. For the Foreign Office officials involved, suggests the historian of the British culpability for these events, ‘The fate of the Russians whose return they enforced was an unfortunate but unavoidable sacrifice to the greater aim.’\n\n\nHe was in much the same mood when he reported to the King on his trip. ‘Was Stalin’s word to be trusted or not?’ the King noted after their lunch. ‘That remains to be proved but we must try it out.’\n\n\nOn 27 March, the day the last V-2 rocket fell on London, Churchill saw off Clementine, who was now president of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, on a long journey to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThat same day, he learned that fourteen Polish leaders representing non-Communist political parties, including the heroic General Kazimierz Okulicki, one of the former commanders of the Home Army, had been arrested by the Red Army near Warsaw, despite written guarantees of safe conduct. After weeks of silence it transpired that they were going to be put on trial in Moscow. If there was any one moment when Churchill was forced to recognize that Stalin had simply been lying to him at Yalta, and there was likely to be a rift with Russia after the German surrender, it was then. He described it in his memoirs as ‘this sinister episode’.\n\n\nDiplomatic relations with Russia deteriorated still further when Stalin accused the British and Americans of conducting secret negotiations with the Germans at Berne in Switzerland, when in fact all Alexander had done was to inform Kesselring of how to go about surrendering unconditionally. Stalin’s distrust and paranoia were obvious.\n\n\n‘What is now Hitler’s best course?’ Churchill asked a lunch party at Chequers in early April, suggesting that the Führer might try to fly to Britain like Rudolf Hess and say, ‘I am responsible; wreak your vengeance on me but spare my people.’ At this, the Duchess of Marlborough retorted that ‘In such a case the only course would be to take him back and drop him by parachute over Germany.’\n\n\nChurchill asked Clementine to ‘express to Stalin personally my cordial feelings and my resolve and confidence that a complete understanding between the English-speaking world and Russia will be achieved and maintained for many years, as this is the only hope of the world.’ When she presented Stalin with a gold fountain pen as a gift from Churchill, he ungraciously replied, ‘I only write with a pencil.’\n\n\nChurchill did not invent the term Iron Curtain, which had been around since 1918 and had appeared in a book Philip Snowden’s wife Dame Ethel Snowden wrote about Bolshevism in 1920, but he stored the evocative phrase away in his extraordinarily capacious memory for a quarter of a century, before deploying it to maximum effect in 1946.\n\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union suffered over 90 per cent of the casualties of the Big Three Powers, Churchill did not want the Americans to behave as if Stalin’s totalitarian dictatorship had some sort of moral equivalency with the Western democracies. Truman nonetheless went ahead and met Stalin privately.\n\n\nSocialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy.\n\n\nChurchill kept up a constant fire against socialism and the Labour Party in Parliament, mocking the Government’s rationing regime as a ‘Queuetopia’. ‘The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings,’ he said in a debate in October.\n\n\n‘From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic,’ he declared, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow … The Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Police governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.\n\n\nThe reaction was immediate and almost unanimously denunciatory. Eleanor Roosevelt, the President’s widow, pronounced herself outraged. Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, told the British Ambassador to the UN that the speech had played into the hands of anti-Western elements in Moscow. The Democrats in the US Congress were furious. The press, not just on the left, was overwhelmingly negative in both Britain and America, let alone elsewhere. More than a hundred Labour MPs signed a motion denouncing the speech.\n\n\n‘Great peoples forget sufferings, but not humiliations.’\n\n\nEveryone will have equal rights in Heaven. That will be the real Welfare State.’\n\n\nIn a debate on foreign affairs in January 1948, Churchill had declared, ‘For my part, I consider that it will be found much better by all parties to leave the past to history, especially as I propose to write that history myself.’\n\n\nI hope you have all mastered the official Socialist jargon which our masters, as they call themselves, wish us to learn. You must not use the word ‘poor’; they are described as the ‘lower income group’. When it comes to a question of freezing a workman’s wages, the Chancellor of the Exchequer speaks of ‘arresting increases in personal income’ … There is a lovely one about houses and homes. They are in future to be called ‘accommodation units’. I don’t know how we are to sing our old song ‘Home Sweet Home’. ‘Accommodation Unit, Sweet Accommodation Unit, There’s no place like our Accommodation Unit.’ I hope to live to see the British democracy spit all this rubbish from their\n\n\nHe still dominated the Cabinet, now more Buddha than Achilles. John Colville on Churchill’s second premiership\n\n\nOver Suez, Churchill profoundly disagreed with Eden, who believed that Britain should cede the Canal Zone unilaterally to foster good relations with Egypt.\n\n\nOn his note that was placed on top of the King’s coffin, Churchill wrote the words ‘For Valour’, the rubric of the Victoria Cross.\n\n\nOn the question of whether the Army should adopt Belgian, British or American automatic rifles, Sir William Slim said, ‘I suppose we shall end up with some mongrel weapon, half-British and half-American.’ ‘Pray moderate your language, Field Marshal,’ said Churchill. ‘That’s an exact description of me.’\n\n\n‘My views are a harmonious process which keeps them in relation to the current movement of events.’\n\n\n‘Free speech carries with it the evil of all foolish, unpleasant and venomous things that are said, but on the whole we would rather lump them than do away with it.’\n\n\n‘I want no criticism of America at my table,’ Churchill said at a lunch at No. 10. ‘The Americans criticize themselves more than enough.’\n\n\nChurchill even attacked Bevan when he wasn’t directly involved in a particular issue: when recalling his own suggestion in 1949 that Communist China should be recognized, Churchill said, ‘If you recognize anyone it does not mean that you like him. We all, for instance, recognize the right honourable Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale.’\n\n\nOn 8 January, Churchill had dinner at the British Embassy in Washington with President Truman, who had less than two weeks left in office. He made a pro-Zionist speech, which practically all the Americans present disliked, though they admitted to Colville ‘that the large Jewish vote would prevent them disagreeing publicly’.\n\n\nOn 15 October Churchill learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize. ‘Is that you, Anthony?’ he telephoned Eden in Paris. ‘How are you? I thought you would like to know that I have just been awarded a Nobel Prize.’ Then, after a pause and a chuckle, he added, ‘But don’t worry, dear, it’s for Literature, not for Peace.’\n\n\nChurchill enjoyed inviting visitors to Chartwell; on one occasion he offered a whisky and soda to a Mormon, who replied, ‘May I have water, Sir Winston? Lions drink it.’ ‘Asses drink it too,’ came the reply.\n\n\nAnother Mormon present said, ‘Strong drink rageth and stingeth like a serpent.’ ‘I have long been looking for a drink like that,’ Churchill retorted.\n\n\n‘I get my exercise as a pall-bearer to my many friends who exercised all their lives,’ he said.\n\n\nChurchill published The Birth of Britain, the first of four volumes of A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, which Clement Attlee suggested should really have been entitled, ‘Things in History Which Have Interested Me’.\n\n\nNo fewer than 112 countries were represented; only Communist China refused to send a representative, and only the Republic of Ireland failed to broadcast the funeral live.\n\n\nHave known finer and greater characters, wiser philosophers, more understanding personalities, but no greater man. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on Churchill, December\n\n\nI have known finer and greater characters, wiser philosophers, more understanding personalities, but no greater man. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on Churchill,\n\n\nIn 1960, when he started writing his memoirs, Lord Ismay told President Eisenhower that an objective biography of Churchill could not be written until at least the year 2010.\n\n\n‘To do justice to a great man,’ Churchill himself wrote, ‘discriminating criticism is necessary. Gush, however quenching, is always insipid.’\n\n\nShould have made nothing if I had not made mistakes.’\n\n\nChurchill’s written output was similarly immense. He published 6.1 million words in thirty-seven books – more than Shakespeare and Dickens combined – and delivered five million in public speeches, not counting his voluminous letter- and memorandum-writing. Partly because he was such a polymath and so prolific, he also seemed to be a mass of contradictions.\n\n\n‘I’ve done a lot of foolish things that turned out well, and a lot of wise things that have turned out badly,’ he said in his CBS interview in New York in March 1932. ‘The misfortune of today may lead to the success of tomorrow.’\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/How-the-War-was-Won":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/How-the-War-was-Won","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Europe/How the War was Won.md","title":"How the War was Won","links":["Turn-the-Ship-Aroundmd"],"tags":["history","world-war-II","history/military","logistics","warfare","military"],"content":"How the war was Won\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book systematically cuts through all the bravado and battlefield-centric focus of World War 2 history and focuses on the things that mattered Manufacturing, logistics, and control over the air-sea theatre. It also provides insight into how the leaders of both the Axis powers as well as the Allies thought and how they argued against themselves, for better or worse.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a really good book; I must say it was a bit dull when describing the relationships between the commanders of WW2, but else it was a really good read If things are correct in this book, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, the way we have thought and discussed WW2 is completely wrong. All the production capacity that could be designed for aircraft was control over the skies meant that you more or less could control the enemy’s movement.\nIt also says when Germany/Japan could not affect the supply system of the Allies, the war was basically lost for them When the U-boat war was done, the German chances of victory followed their Uboats to the bottom.\nI was really astonished by how much resources were delegated to aircraft and vessels and how little to armoured vehicles It was pretty much everything they could. Furthermore, it was also important for me to understand how the leaders thought and fought over which initiatives should be prioritized, which is something that is not discussed too much and I did not know that much about.\nIt is insane to me that the enormous losses of the Soviets and also the Germans to an extent on the east front were, at the time, not that relevant We humans were reduced to a small portion of what war really was about. I think the industrialisation of war has made us small cogs in the system, with the horrendous consequences that it has entailed.\nOne thing I learned later in Turn the Ship Around was the massive impact of the American submarine force during WWII. In this book this is debated and it is not certain the amount of impact the submarine warfare against Japan.\nA podcast on the same topic\n✍️ My Top Quotes\n\n\nThere are two targets the bombing of which brings everyone to their knees: fuel and communications\n\n\nGerman army lost at most 350 armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) during the first ten days of the Battle of Kursk, when the fighting was most intense During all of July and August 1943 on the Eastern Front the German army lost 1,331 AFV. Yet, during 1943 as a whole, Germany produced just over 12,000 AFV. This means that the Germans lost less than 3 % of the AFV they built in 1943 during the Battle of Kursk, and only 11 % of annual AFV production during all of July and August. El Alamein was even less damaging. At the start of the battle on October 23, 1942, Rommel’s famous Panzerarmee Afrika had 249 German tanks. By November 4, 36 of these were left. The Germans thus lost just over 200 AFV in two weeks. Within the context of German AFV production, El Alamein barely registered.\n\n\nIndustrially and technologically, the war was primarily a competition of aircraft development and construction In Germany, the construction of airframes, air engines, and the weapons and machinery needed to power and arm aircraft made up at least 50 % of German production every year of the war, and at certain times reached up to 55 %.\n\n\nThe German V1 and V2 campaigns, which the Anglo-Americans tried to counter with enormous air assets under the codename Operation Crossbow, represented a far greater economic exertion on both sides than did land battles such as Stalingrad or the invasions of Sicily and Italy The design and construction of the V2 rocket, for instance, probably cost as much as all German AFV construction between 1939 and 1945. On the other hand, the RAF and USAAF actually dropped more ordnance on Crossbow targets in the summer of 1944 than they dropped in support of Allied armies in Normandy – in the end it represented 3 % of the Anglo-American air effort in all theaters throughout the entire war.\n\n\nOne of the other reasons losses mounted in the second half of 1944 was even more seriously degraded pilot training Even as the need for more and more pilots became pressing owing to increased production and increased losses, the Luftwaffe had no fuel to train them. In July 1944 the number of hours a German pilot trainee needed before being sent on operations was reduced to approximately 100. Of this, only 30 were spent in aircraft with the power of operational fighters. At the same time, both the RAF and USAAF required at least 300 hours before operations, and almost all the flying time was in aircraft with engines as powerful as they would have when on operations. However, it does seem that in certain cases the Germans couldn’t even supply enough fuel to give their pilots the 100 hours of training. Lt General Gerd von Massow, who directed German pilot training in 1944 and 1945, admitted that as fuel ran low, he simply stopped training certain pilots. “Eventually I arrived at the state where, with the small amount of petrol still remaining to me, I trained only those who were instructors with me and those who were half finished – all the rest, thousands and thousands of them, I handed over, men of the very best material whose training I simply couldn’t complete anymore.”\n\n\nIn 1965 a major movie was made about Operation Crossbow which epitomizes everything that is wrong about the daring-do vision of World War II Starring George Peppard and Sophia Loren, it tells the story of an American secret agent being infiltrated into an underground German V2 factory that looks more like the lair of a James Bond villain than the real caves of misery and death in which the rockets were built. From the inside, this brave secret agent proceeds to sabotage German rocket production. However, within the context of winning World War II, the real problem with the movie is that it hardly mentions the real Operation Crossbow, which was the enormous allocation of air resources against German V1 and V2 production and launch facilities.\n\n\nAs late as the first quarter of 1943, 11 % of German war output was made up of submarine production. The figure then declined steadily in the second half of 1943, after Germany had lost the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\n\nBy 1944, Germany and Japan were losing between one-quarter and one-half of their produced aircraft trying to deploy them to their operating areas These extraordinary losses show how air and sea power operated on a far more profound level than land warfare. One of the main paths to these losses was laid in 1943, when the pressure of the air and sea war forced both countries to try to produce many more pilots while severely reducing their access to fuel.\n\n\nOf course, the Nazi state was responsible for many of these shortcomings German science blossomed during the tolerant Weimar Republic, but under the racist and anti-Semitic Nazi dictatorship, many of Germany’s finest scientific minds, most famously Albert Einstein, left for the United States and Great Britain where they would do important work against the country of their birth.\n\n\nWhen it comes to overall losses of AFV from D-Day through August and the full-scale German withdrawal over the Seine, numbers vary from 1,500 on the low side to 2,000 on the higher end. Manpower losses also became extreme, and beginning in August, those in the west surpassed those in the east for the first time in the war.\n\n\nHowever, in 1944 and 1945 the Germans experienced a dramatic leap in casualties, losing more men killed in 1944 alone than they lost during the entire time between 1939 and 1943 In 1945 these losses continued at this extreme pace, with the Germans losing almost as many men between January and April of that year as they lost in 1942 and 1943 combined.\n\n\nFor much of the war there was one group, interestingly led by Churchill, which argued for the creation of specialized hunter-killer groups of anti-submarine vessels Such groups would be unencumbered from convoy duty and sent out to try to find submarines. While conceptually this might sound sensible, it ended up being an almost total failure. Submarines were simply too difficult to locate on their own, and these hunter-killer groups achieved little. On the other hand, by 1943, the convoy itself could be turned into the hunter-killer group – by appearing to be an enticing prey. Periodically, or so the reasoning went, a different convoy, preferably a large one, could be escorted by twice the usual allotment of escort vessels. The submarines that attacked such an over-escorted convoy would be facing extreme danger.\n\n\nDisagreeing with Alanbrooke was sure to be seen by him as a sign of a lack of intelligence, which seems to have been particularly the case for George Marshall Both Marshall and Alanbrooke had a rather low opinion of the other’s intelligence, but for Alanbrooke, pointing out Marshall’s supposed stupidity was a regular event, especially when the two disagreed about strategic priorities: “A very disappointing wire from American COS – Marshall absolutely fails to realize what strategic treasures lie at our feet in the Mediterranean and always hankers after cross Channel operations.\n\n\nMuch of his bile was reserved for Churchill, for not recognizing Alanbrooke’s strategic genius When Churchill first conceived of an operation to capture northern Sumatra, Alanbrooke reacted as if the Prime Minister had lost his mind.\n\n\nRoosevelt’s exact thinking in 1941 is still elusive On the one hand, there are those who believe that he was determined to get the United States into the war by whatever means, Machiavellian or not, that lay at his disposal. He thus broke international and national law to help Britain and the USSR, tried to goad the Germans into firing on American warships on the high seas, and when all this failed, ended up forcing the Japanese into attacking the United States by embargoing the sale of oil to Japan.\n\n\nAt Trident itself, the British walked into this trap, only partly aware of the gravity of their actions In his memoirs of World War II, Churchill speaks openly about the British heading to Trident determined to thwart American plans for aggressive action in Burma. During the meetings Churchill listed supporting China as Britain’s sixth highest priority, and even then was probably being disingenuous.\n\n\nHinsley makes the fundamental mistake of not differentiating between merchant ships sunk in convoy and those sunk outside of convoy In the first six months of 1941, while sinkings were high, they were still primarily sinkings outside of convoy. At this time, 344,000 tons of merchant ships were sunk sailing independently, only 147,000 tons were lost in convoy, and another 66,000 were lost straggling behind. The idea that somehow this figure for convoy losses would have gone up by 750 % without Ultra seems questionable.\n\n\nIf there was one great opponent of the bombing of submarine installations it was Air Marshal Harris Beginning in late 1942, Harris began to complain strongly that the intense American effort to bomb submarine facilities, including the “impermeable” submarine pens, was a great waste of resources. He regularly lobbied Portal and the Americans to stop attacks on the U-boat pens, which he considered impervious. Of course, being Harris, his solution was to abandon almost all defensive efforts and expend resources on attacks on German cities, which he assumed would lead to a collapse in German submarine production. He wanted to withdraw much of the air protection devoted to convoys and switch these resources to strategic bombing. His monomania led him to take a basically correct position on the inability to bomb German U-boat pens and turn it into one that would have made things worse.\n\n\nDuring 1943, the construction of anti-aircraft guns made up 28 % of German weapons production, or almost 3 % of overall munitions output. These weapons also consumed a massive amount of German ammunition production, which was the second highest category of munitions production in Germany after aircraft. Between January 1943 and September 1944, antiaircraft ammunition made up about 17 % of overall German ammunition production. As ammunition production made up approximately 30 % of German munitions output, producing ammunition for anti-aircraft guns in 1943 would have been almost 5 % of overall output – so that building and arming anti-aircraft weaponry in 1943 would have been approximately 7 % of overall German munitions output. This would have put it almost exactly on a par with German AFV production (not including ammunition) for the year.\n\n\nBeyond that, the damage wrought by a small number of German submarines in early 1942, much of which was the result of conscious choices, resulted in many billions of dollars being spent on both escort vessels and merchant ships in late 1942 and 1943 Spending on each was increased by at least a combined figure of 3 billion in late 1942 (1.8 billion extra for merchant ships and $1 billion extra for small naval vessels). These billions, especially for the huge number of new escort vessels, were to a large degree wasted, even if that wasn’t realized when they were allocated. By the summer of 1943, it was clear that a drastic over-production of escort vessels had been undertaken.\n\n\nThis simple fact of speed differential should also help correct one of the other misunderstandings about the war at sea, and that is the relative uniformity of merchant tonnage The tonnage that the Germans were able to sink for much of the war was older, unescorted vessels or ships that were taking part in slower convoys. The loss of such vessels, while serious, was being made up by new construction that was considerably faster, such as the Liberty ships. The tonnage of these newer, faster vessels was worth considerably more than the tonnage of older, slower ships. Not only could they bring goods and supplies across the Atlantic more quickly, they were inherently safer. For instance, between October 1942 and May 1943, the faster convoys (those averaging around 9 knots) suffered a 50 % smaller casualty rate than slower convoys (those averaging around 7 knots), even when they were attacked at approximately the same rate.\n\n\nBefore the month was out, Doenitz had decided to abandon the North Atlantic – which for all intents and purposes meant that Germany was definitely going to lose World War II\n\n\nIn the end, the 100th suffered more than any other 8th Air Force unit during the Regensburg raid, losing nine of its twenty-one B17s This was an unsustainable casualty rate, and it is one of the reasons that the Anglo-American strategic air offensive of 1943 is almost universally seen as a failure. And yet, for all its heavy losses, this one raid on Regensburg destroyed far more aircraft than the Germans lost during the Battle of Kursk, perhaps more than they lost on the Eastern Front during all of the summer of 1943.\n\n\nPerhaps the COA’s most famous, and controversial, industrial target, which heretofore had rarely been mentioned in USAAF war plans, was the German anti-friction bearing (ball-bearing) industry Ball-bearings appealed to the COA for a number of reasons. They were indispensable elements for all modern war equipment (aircraft, submarines, tanks, artillery). Most importantly, however, most of Germany’s ball-bearing production was concentrated in the vicinity of the town of Schweinfurt. By the COA’s estimation, at least 40 % of all ball-bearing production within Germany and Germanoccupied Europe was in three facilities around this town. The actual figure was even larger, with the three Schweinfurt plants in August 1943 accounting for 57 % of German manufacturing capacity in anti-friction bearings, and when it came to ball bearings of the crucial size of between 8 and 150 mm, they produced 95 %. Destroying them and a handful of other targets, it was hoped, would send shockwaves throughout all Germany’s munitions production.\n\n\nUp until 1942, German pilot and non-operational aircraft losses were manageable However, in late 1943 and early 1944 losses resulting from poor pilot training grew significantly. According to Galland, a German fighter pilot had a 5 % chance of being killed or wounded badly per month in 1942. By 1944, this had reached 30 % per month, with the great acceleration being in the second half of 1943.\n\n\nDispersal caused real problems for the Luftwaffe in more than just lost production A major problem was that the new factories, built with great haste, produced aircraft with more structural flaws. Goering believed that this was a particular problem that plagued the Luftwaffe in 1944. The quality of aircraft built in the dispersed factories “suffered considerably. It happened, for instance, that the fittings at the assembly were not accurate enough, and similar things. Sometimes it was just that the fittings on the wing section were rough, in other cases the two landing wheels were different.”\n\n\nUsing Milch’s calculations above, supported by the evidence from the different industrialists, it would be conservative to say that the total number of German aircraft, mostly fighters, destroyed before production because of factory destruction, relocation and aluminum losses in 1943 was somewhere between five and six thousand This estimate is in line with Strategic Bombing Survey calculations and the differences between German intended and actual outputs. The USSBS estimated that between July 1943 and December 1944, German aircraft production was reduced by 18,492 units because of strategic bombing, of which 14,353 were fighters. This all makes sense when one looks at how the rise in German aircraft construction stopped immediately in July 1943, and leveled off (with some noticeable declines) until February 1944.\n\n\nSpeer calculated that by 1944, 28,000 workers were devoted to building constructions to protect Hitler from British and American bombs148 The Fuhrer was so terrified by the prospect of being killed in an air raid that the concrete roof thickness of these structures ultimately reached 16 feet, or more than 5 meters. However, Hitler’s personal safety only tells part of the story.\n\n\nThese modern fortresses range from the Fuhrerbunker and flak towers in central Berlin to the U-boat pens that populated the western European coast. They were built to and did withstand multiple direct bomb hits. To this day many of them remain indestructible, such as the U-boat pens constructed in Trondheim, Norway, which have proved too difficult and expensive to dismantle even after repeated attempts.\n\n\nMorale in a totalitarian society is irrelevant so long as the control patterns function effectively. The Nazi party controls have functioned well. Air raids have produced temporary local outbreaks, but the opposition has had little opportunity to take advantage of the breakdown of communications, transport and services in these periods. Social control is required to re-establish the conditions where life is possible. This the Nazi party has been sufficiently adaptable to provide.\n\n\nOverall, the V2 was the most expensive weapon system the Nazis ever undertook The USSBS estimate was that the effort that went into the project in 1944 and 1945 alone was equal to the cost of production of 24,000 aircraft. Another estimate is that the development and production of the V2 cost Nazi Germany RM 2 billion In that case it would have cost Germany in relative terms as much as the Manhattan Project cost the United States. Actually this latter estimate might be too low, as production costs alone would have reached that level. In per unit costs, according to Speer, the first V2s cost RM 1 million each. Later, when production became more efficient, the per unit cost dropped to somewhere between RM 250,000 and RM 300,000. The actual number of V2s built was between 6,000 and 7,000. At the end of the war, documents from Speer’s ministry claimed that in 1944, 4,145 were completed, with an additional 2,165 finished in 1945. However the director of the main assembly plant, the Mittelwerke at Niedersachswerfen claimed that a larger number was built, more than 7,000. Even if we accept the lower estimate on production and cost, more than 6,000 V2s were built, at an average cost of something close to RM 300,000 each, which alone would have cost close almost RM 2 billion. If the higher estimates for number and cost are right, the overall cost could easily have reached 3 billion RM.\n\n\nIt seems that at least 60,000–70,000 slave workers were forcibly put to work at the main production facilities for the V2156 Tragically, 10,000 of these workers perished from the extraordinary brutality they were shown by their Nazi captors, making them the single largest group of human victims killed by the V-weapons.\n\n\nIndividual air raids on Hamburg and Tokyo killed many times more civilians than all the V1s and V2s together One of the reasons for this relatively limited loss of life was the effectiveness of Crossbow, especially against the launch sites.\n\n\nWhilst in September 1943, an average of 19,900 wagons of coal were transported daily in the Ruhr Area, this allocation of wagons has fallen in the last few days to 8700 and 7700 wagons due to air attacks Consequently, after about 8 to 12 weeks the industrial stocks, which are based on 4 weeks’ supply, will be exhausted.\n\n\nTogether, all of these attacks on German army mobility resulted in a cataclysm of losses that dwarfed those of earlier in the war As mentioned previously, German casualties before 1944 were actually manageable and running at a pace below that of World War I. In 1944, however, casualties became catastrophic. In just two months of 1944, July and August, the Germans reported 563,973 deaths in their armed services. This was equal to the number of deaths in all of 1942 and 70 % as many deaths as suffered by the Germans in all of 1943. German ground equipment losses followed suit and, for the first time in the war, progressed at a rate far higher than replacement production\n\n\nSuch a plan appealed to Marshall for two main reasons The first was his honest and strong conviction that bases in China were a necessity for the defeat of Japan. The second was the need to give Douglas MacArthur a major command that would appease his enormous ego. Marshall had many prima donnas to deal with during World War II, but MacArthur was especially gilded. He was desperate for glory in general, but specifically focused on leading a major campaign to retake the Philippines.\n\n\nAmerican submarines were the most effective weapon that the United States had in the trade war, and they did extract a large toll on Japanese merchant shipping However, it seems difficult to reach a consensus on their value. Morison paid only a small amount of attention to this trade campaign, giving only eleven pages in one of his volumes. On the other hand, others imply that they could almost have won the trade war by themselves and shut off Japanese trade throughout the empire.\n\n\nMany within the Japanese power structure also realized that the loss of the Marianas was so profound that, had it been politically possible, Japan should have sued for peace at that time. Rear Admiral Soichi Takaga began studying the potential impact of the loss of the Marianas on Japanese power in 1943. What he discovered was that losing the islands, regardless of any further operations to take the Philippines or Singapore, would effectively end Japanese trade with their southern empire.\n\n\nAlmost immediately after Peleiu, was taken, it was realized that the effort was unnecessary. Admiral Halsey for one claimed it was a waste of time and they should have been bypassed, even if the Americans were going to the Philippines. Avoiding Peleiu would have saved many American lives, for instance on Iwo Jima. That famous island was defended by just a small number of unprepared Japanese troops when the Marianas fell. Saburo Sakai, when he made his emergency deployment to Iwo Jima after the news of the invasion of Saipan broke, was surprised to see how poorly the island was protected. American air attacks on Iwo as part of the Marianas operations left the forces on the island unable to react, and in his view it would have been conquered easily at that time. However, the diversion of effort to the Philippines saved the island for Japan, for now.\n\n\nHitler continued to have great hopes in the effectiveness of the Type XXI until the moment when he put a bullet into his head. One of the reasons that the German dictator ordered German forces in the Courland pocket to hold their positions (thus depriving Germany of many troops that could have been stationed in front of Berlin) was because the navy needed a safe area along the Baltic coast in which it could test the Type XXI.\n\n\nEven though heavy mining around Japan did not start until March, in 1945 as a whole it was responsible for sinking more tonnage than US submarines\n\n\nThat their leaders, to try to prolong their political authority, would not take the honorable step that the leaders of imperial Germany took in 1918 speaks volumes about both the horrible and yet grotesquely petty nature of both regimes\n\n\nThroughout the war, the economies of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States were geared by very large majorities towards the manufacture of air and sea weaponry In every case, the construction of aircraft was the single greatest priority for each economy, composing at a minimum one-third of output, as for the United States, to more than half, as for the United Kingdom. When the equipping and arming of the aircraft was added to the mix, these figures were increased. Because of this, during the war, the Luftwaffe received more than half of German production. When one adds to this the enormous German effort in antiaircraft construction from 1943 onwards, the vast majority of which was for the air war over Germany, approximately 60 % of German production was made up of armed aircraft and anti-air weaponry when munitions output reached its peak.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/Kvitekrist":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/Kvitekrist","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Europe/Kvitekrist.md","title":"Kvitekrist","links":[],"tags":["norwegian-books","history","books","non-fiction"],"content":"Kvitekrist\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the life of Olav Haraldson, also known as Olav the Holy.

If they gave us rifles we would find some.\n\n\nThey set high prices for industrial goods and low prices for agricultural products (hence the designation ‘scissors crisis’), which created an imbalance\n\n\nFor the Communist Party the crisis threatened to overshadow an important anniversary: ten years after the revolution, living standards in the Soviet Union were still lower than they had been under the tsars.\n\n\nContained no evidence of foreign contacts or revolutionary conspiracies. Yefremov nevertheless ‘confessed’, after being told that there was no other way to save his wife from arrest and torture.\n\n\n‘It is better to be a good farmer in America than a bad one in Russia and be called a kulak.’\n\n\nEven when not out on raiding parties, the brigades and their leaders collected information about food and who might have it. Informers were recruited to help out the activists. In some villages special boxes were set up where people could deposit anonymous confessions or information as to the whereabouts of their neighbours’ hidden grain.26 Hanna Sukhenko remembered that it was ‘popular’ to inform, because when a person found someone else’s food, he or she was given up to a third of it as a reward.\n\n\nLike the central planners of the same era, the OGPU was nothing if not ambitious. Of all the grain-growing regions of the USSR, Ukraine was expected to deliver the most kulaks: 15,000 of the most ‘diehard and active kulaks’ were to be arrested, 30,000–35,000 kulak families were to be exiled, and all 50,000 were to be removed to the Northern Krai, the northern Russian region near Arkhangelsk on the White Sea.\n\n\nAnyone who expressed discontent was a kulak. Peasant families that had never used hired labor were put down as kulaks.\n\n\nAs elsewhere in the USSR, children were instructed to denounce their parents, and were questioned at school about what was going on at home.\n\n\nThis most visceral and immediate form of resistance continued well into the following year and beyond. Between 1928 and 1933 the numbers of cattle and horses in the USSR dropped by nearly half. From 26 million pigs, the number went down to 12 million. From 146 million sheep and goats, the total dropped to 50 million.5 Those who did not slaughter their animals protected them ferociously.\n\n\nMany decades later, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and the grandson of kulaks, described the collective farms as ‘serfdom’.\n\n\nEverybody understood, at some level, that collectivization was itself the source of the new shortages. Stalin himself had received reports explaining exactly what was wrong with the collective farms, describing their inefficiency in great detail\n\n\nGiven the scale of the food shortages it was hardly surprising that the peasants balked, that spring, and, as in 1921, refused to sow their land: if they planted their last remaining kernels of seed grain, then they would have nothing to eat. They must also have known that whatever they did manage to grow would be confiscated. In April 1932 the OGPU raised the alarm: more than 40,000 households were not going to plant anything at all.\n\n\nMykola Kostyrko, an engineer who lived in Odessa at the time, remembered ‘foreign vessels’ coming into the port: ‘they exported everything in order to get foreign capital for the “needs of the state” to buy tractors and for propaganda abroad’. At one point, he remembered, longshoremen in Odessa refused to load pigs onto a ship. A detachment of Red Army soldiers was sent to do it for them.\n\n\nYears later, Susannah Pechora, a Gulag prisoner in a later period, recalled meeting a fellow prisoner, a former peasant. Upon being given her meagre daily ration, the woman sighed and stroked the small, hard chunk of bread. ‘Khlebushka, my little bit of bread,’ she purred, ‘and to think that they give you to us every day!’\n\n\nSeveral sets of directives that autumn, on requisitions, blacklisted farms and villages, border controls and the end of Ukrainization – along with an information blockade and extraordinary searches, designed to remove everything edible from the homes of millions of peasants – created the famine now remembered as the Holodomor. The Holodomor, in turn, delivered the predictable result: the Ukrainian national movement disappeared completely from Soviet politics and public life. The ‘cruel lesson of 1919’ had been learned, and Stalin intended never to repeat it.\n\n\n‘The passport system laid an administrative and judicial cornerstone for the new serfdom and tied down the peasantry as it had been before the emancipation of 1861.’\n\n\nHe had also travelled around the decimated countryside and witnessed the growing numbers of starving peasants, and he returned to Kharkiv devastated. He told a friend that the famine he had witnessed was a purely political construction, ‘designed to solve a very dangerous Ukrainian problem all at once’.\n\n\nI’m no longer under a spell, I can see now that the kulaks were human beings. But why was my heart so frozen at the time? When such terrible things were being done, when such suffering was going on all around me? And the truth is that I truly didn’t think of them as human beings. ‘They’re not human beings, they’re kulak trash’ – that’s what I heard again and again, that’s what everyone kept repeating … Vasily Grossman, Everything Flows,\n\n\nKopelev himself found the task ‘excruciating’, but he also learned that constant repetition of hateful propaganda helped him steel himself to the task at hand: ‘I persuaded myself, explained to myself. I mustn’t give in to debilitating pity. We were realizing historical necessity. We were performing our revolutionary duty. We were obtaining grain for the socialist fatherland. For the five-year plan.’\n\n\nNot one of them was guilty of anything; but they belonged to a class that was guilty of everything. Ilya Ehrenburg, 1934\n\n\nFaced with terrible choices, many made decisions of a kind they would not previously have been able to imagine. One woman told her village that while she would always be able to give birth to other children, she had only one husband, and she wanted him to survive. She duly confiscated the bread her children received at a local kindergarten, and all her children died\n\n\n‘There were no funerals,’ recalled Kateryna Marchenko. ‘There were no priests, requiems, tears. There was no strength to cry.’\n\n\nEmotions about the cow ran high. Petro Mostovyi in Poltava province remembered that the family cow was so precious that his father and older brother guarded it with a gun and pitchforks.\n\n\nTo feed their cow, Mariia Pata’s family had to take the roof thatch off their house, rip it into small pieces, and soften it with boiling water so that the animal could eat.25\n\n\nIhor Buhaievych and his grandmother survived in Chernihiv province on dried bread crusts that his mother mailed in packages from Leningrad, where she had managed to find a job. That helped keep them alive until the local post office informed the activist brigade, which began confiscating some of the crusts. Later, Ihor’s mother came home and managed to take him to Leningrad herself.\n\n\n3.9 million excess deaths, or direct losses, and 0.6 million lost births, or indirect losses. That brings the total number of missing Ukrainians to 4.5 million\n\n\nNikita Khrushchev denounced these mass population transfers, and joked that ‘Ukrainians avoided meeting this fate only because there were too many of them and there was no place to which to deport them. Otherwise, (Stalin) would have deported them also.’ The official transcript recorded that this remark sparked ‘laughter and animation in the hall’.\n\n\nSergio Gradenigo, the observant Italian consul in Kharkiv, reported to Rome a conversation with an unnamed acquaintance who had agreed that the ‘Russification of Donbas’ was underway. He linked the policy to the closure of Ukrainian-language theatres, the restriction of Ukrainian opera music to just three cities, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa, and the end of Ukrainization.\n\n\nThere is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition. Walter Duranty, The New York Times, 31 March 1933\n\n\nRather than accept the result, Stalin abolished it. Meetings were called; expert panels were created. A special Central Committee resolution declared the census badly organized, unprofessional, and a ‘gross violation of the basic fundamentals of statistical science’.\n\n\nWith publication of the 1939 census the great famine vanished not only from the newspapers but from Soviet demography, politics and bureaucracy.\n\n\nGradenigo, the Italian consul who lived in Kharkiv between 1930 and 1934, understood both the scale of the famine and the impact it had on the Ukrainian national movement. He did not doubt that ‘the hunger is principally the result of a famine organized in order to teach a lesson to the peasants’:\n\n\nAndrew Cairns, who travelled through Ukraine and the North Caucasus in 1932 on behalf of the Empire Marketing Board. Cairns reported seeing ‘rag-clad hungry peasants, some begging for bread, mostly waiting, mostly in vain, for tickets, many climbing on to the steps or joining the crowds on the roof of each car, all filthy and miserable and not a trace of a smile anywhere’. He also concluded that the government’s grain export plan was ‘ridiculous’ and could not be fulfilled.\n\n\nFlavour of the cynical weariness with which at least some of the Soviet intelligentsia received these pompous outsiders can be deduced from Andrey Platonov’s play, Fourteen Little Red Huts. Platonov’s play features a visiting foreign intellectual who demands, ‘Where can I see socialism? Show it to me at once. Capitalism irritates me.’\n\n\nDuranty, British by birth, had no ties to the ideological left, adopting rather the position of a hard-headed and sceptical ‘realist’ trying to listen to both sides of a story.\n\n\nDuranty’s accounts chimed with their general worldview and attracted wide attention: in 1932 his series of articles on the successes of collectivization and the Five Year Plan won him the Pulitzer Prize. Soon afterwards, Roosevelt, then the governor of New York, invited Duranty to the governor’s mansion in Albany, where the Democratic presidential candidate peppered him with queries. ‘I asked all the questions this time. It was fascinating,’ Roosevelt told another reporter.\n\n\n‘I tramped through the black earth region,’ he wrote, ‘because that was once the richest farmland in Russia and because the correspondents have been forbidden to go there to see for themselves what is happening.’\n\n\nCensorship has turned them into masters of euphemism and understatement. Hence they give ‘famine’ the polite name of ‘food shortage’ and ‘starving to death’ is softened down to read as ‘widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition’.\n\n\nRoosevelt’s interest in central planning and in what he thought were the USSR’s great economic successes – the president read Duranty’s reporting carefully – encouraged him to believe that there might be a lucrative commercial relationship too.\n\n\nThree decades later, Prokopenko managed to read a poem on a local television station, including a line about ‘people black with hunger’. A threatening visit from local authorities followed, but that left him even more convinced that the USSR was responsible for the tragedy.\n\n\nTottle’s book posited, among other things, that the Ukrainian diaspora were all ‘Nazis’; that the famine books and monographs constituted an anti-Soviet, Nazi propaganda drive that also had links to Western intelligence.\n\n\nThose who lived through the Ukrainian famine always described it, once they were allowed to describe it, as an act of state aggression. The peasants who experienced the searches and the blacklists remembered them as a collective assault on themselves and their culture. The Ukrainians who witnessed the arrests and murders of intellectuals, academics, writers and artists remembered them in the same way, as a deliberate attack on their national cultural elite.\n\n\nRaphael Lemkin, the legal scholar who invented the word – combining the Greek word ‘genos’, meaning race or nation, with the Latin ‘cide’, meaning killing – studied law at the University of Lviv, then called Lwów, in the 1920s.\n\n\nMedvedev told the president of Azerbaijan that he could ‘forget about Nagorno-Karabakh,’ a region disputed by Azerbaijan and Armenia, unless he voted against a proposal to call the Holodomor a genocide.\n\n\nCertainly the elimination of Ukraine’s elite in the 1930s – the nation’s best scholars, writers and political leaders as well as its most energetic farmers – continues to matter. Even three generations later, many of contemporary Ukraine’s political problems, including widespread distrust of the state, weak national institutions and a corrupt political class, can be traced directly back to the loss of that first, post-revolutionary, patriotic elite.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/The-First-World-War":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Europe/The-First-World-War","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Europe/The First World War.md","title":"The First World War","links":["Europe/How-the-War-was-Won"],"tags":["books","history","great-world-war","non-fiction","leadership","management"],"content":"The First World War\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the history of the great world war. It covers the major strategic themes and goes in-depth on the conflicts outside of the Western front. It is a book that focuses on the war and only the war.\n🎨 Impressions\nI found it to be an insightful and informative book that is more detailed than I am used to when it comes to history. As my thoughts have been focused more on logistics and the economy as part of the war, it was interesting for me to read the book with that context in mind. Books such as How the War was Won by Phillips O´Brien show that the economy is uber alles in modern warfare. And to be sure, the great war was the first modern war. I also found it interesting how personal cognitive biases often hampered the success of battle and this was one of the factors that ultimately led to the defeat of the Axis powers. Also, German high-handedness in the face of their allies was deemed to be a fatal flaw. Many interesting quotes from the book.\nHow I Discovered It\nI wanted to learn more about the Great War and this was a recommended reading.\nWho Should Read It?\nAs the great war shaped the history of the 20th century it is recommended for all who want to understand modern history.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI get more and more astonied by the lack of clearly holistic views. And how little information the people high up in the command chain had. There are many things to digest from this book, but I think the book has clear and insightful lessons on leadership and management.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe notion that British soldiers were ‘lions led by donkeys’ continues to provoke a debate that has not lost its passion, even if it is now devoid of originality.\n\n\nDulce et decorum est pro patria mori, that ‘it is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country’, is, he insists, ‘an old lie’.\n\n\nWhen the First World War began, historians, especially in Imperial Germany, identified a ‘long’ nineteenth century, starting with the French Revolution in 1789 and ending in 1914. For their successors that was when the ’short’ twentieth century began, and it ended with the conclusion of the Cold War in 1990.\n\n\nAlthough he was heir apparent to his aged uncle, Franz Josef, the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, his wife was treated according to the rank with which she had been born, that of an impoverished Czech aristocrat.\n\n\nFor Austria-Hungary, the situation in the Balkans was as much a matter of domestic politics as of foreign policy. The empire consisted of eleven different nationalities and many of them had ethnic links to independent states that lay beyond its frontiers.\n\n\nThe head of Serb military intelligence, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevi, code-named Apis, was one of a group of officers who had murdered the previous king in 1903. An enthusiastic promoter of the idea of a greater Serbia and a member of a secret terrorist organisation, the Black Hand, he was ‘incapable of distinguishing what was possible from what was not and perceiving the limits of responsibility and power’.\n\n\n‘Poli-tics’, he stated, ‘consists precisely of applying war as method.’\n\n\nIts government had been liberalised in response to the 1905 revolution and its annual growth rate was 3. percent. Between 1908 and 1913 its industrial production increased by 50 percent, an expansion which was largely fuelled by defence-related output. Russia’s army was already the biggest in Europe. By 1917 it would be three times the size of Germany’s.\n\n\nThe trial of Madame Caillaux, wife of the former radical prime minister Joseph Caillaux, began on 20 July. She had shot the editor of Le Figaro, who had published the love letters exchanged between herself and her husband: on 28 July the gallant French jury acquitted her on the grounds that this was a crime passionel.\n\n\nTheir wishful thinking reflected Conrad’s: this was to be the Third Balkan War, not the First World War.\n\n\nOver 2000, Bosnians were deported or interned, some of them Muslims who had fled to Bosnia to escape the Orthodox Serbs.*\n\n\n‘Our troops’, one soldier serving with the Honved reported, ‘have struck out terribly in all directions, like the Swedes in the Thirty Years War. Nothing, or almost nothing, is intact. In every house individuals are to be seen searching for things that are still useable.’\n\n\nWithin four months Austria-Hungary’s casualties totalled 957,000 more than twice the army’s pre-war strength.\n\n\nBy 1914, the German colonies attracted one in a thousand of Germany’s emigrants, absorbed 3 percent of Germany’s overseas investment, and accounted for 0.5 percent of its overseas trade. Territorial expansion was not a high priority for Germany, and it was not a cause of the First World War.\n\n\nGermany industrialized late but very rapidly. The value of its output increased well over six times between 1855 and 1913.\n\n\nIn 1870 Britain, with 32 percent of the world’s manufacturing capacity, was the largest industrial power in the world. By 1910, it had been overtaken by the United States, which had 35 percent of the world’s manufacturing capacity, and Germany with 15 percent; Britain now had 14 percent.\n\n\nThe chancellor of Germany held office because he was the Kaiser’s choice, not because he enjoyed a majority in the Reichstag. His success as chancellor largely depended on his ability to manage the Reichstag despite the lack of a party base.\n\n\nBut it might appease the socialists, who became the largest single party in the Reichstag in the 1912 elections.\n\n\nMoltke was not unusual among professional servicemen in anticipating that any future European war would be long, nor uncharacteristic among his own class in fearing that such a war would have revolutionary domestic consequences.\n\n\nUntil 1914 Germany relied on Chile for imports of saltpetre, from which it produced fixed nitrogen. Nitric acid was needed for explosives, and nitrogen for fertilisers and therefore for food production.\n\n\nIn 1914 only 5. percent of German reservists came from big cities; as a result the army was comparatively untouched by the socialism that seemed to threaten the Reich from within.\n\n\nOver a period of three days the allies were defeated along the entire length of the front. Forty thousand French soldiers were killed, and by 29 August their casualties totalled 260,000.\n\n\nEmploying delayed-action fuses for ricochet fire, a 75mm battery was able to sweep an area of 4 hectares, 400 meters deep, in 40 to 50 seconds. Its four guns, firing ten rounds of shrapnel a minute, discharged 10, balls. This was far more effective against advancing infantry than machine guns.\n\n\nGermany had, however, made two significant gains, even if both were incidental. First, it had overrun almost all Belgium as well as the industrial heartlands of north-eastern France, including 74 percent of its coal production and 81 percent of its pig iron. Second, it held so much French territory, and did so along positions which in many cases were so extraordinarily well adapted for fighting defensively, that it retained the advantages of an offensive strategy.\n\n\nBefore the war the socialist Jean Jaurès had been criticised by the radical right for his internationalism and his advocacy of a pure citizen army. But when he was assassinated by a solitary maverick on 31 July 1914, his death became symbolic for the right as well as the left. This was a Jaurèsian war: a war of national self-defence.\n\n\nHe was one of over 2 million Africans who served in the war as soldiers and labourers: 10 percent of them died, and among the labourers the rate may have reached 20 percent. These were casualty rates comparable with those on the western front.\n\n\nTo many whites it seemed self-evident that the use of colonial troops to topple other European powers could only be self-destructive in the long term. War would rekindle the very warrior traditions that colonialism had been designed to extirpate, and ultimately the black trained to use a rifle against a white enemy might turn his weapon on his own white ruler.\n\n\nA German journalist greeted the party on its arrival by asking its commander, Hellmuth von Mücke, which he would prefer, a bath or Rhine wine: ‘Rhine wine,’ replied von Mücke.\n\n\nBy January 1915 German surface vessels had accounted for 215, of the 273, tons of merchant shipping sunk, but that was only 2 percent of British commercial tonnage.\n\n\nThe key to his approach was the use of mounted infantry on the lines favoured by the Afrikaners in both their previous campaigns. But horses in East Africa inevitably succumbed to the tsetse fly. The British knew which were the worst regions for fly, because German veterinarians had obligingly supplied them with maps before the war, but this information was not incorporated in the campaign plan.\n\n\nThe 2nd Rhodesia Regiment had an effective strength of 800 men, but with a wastage rate of 20 percent per month it was often reduced to 100 men.\n\n\nIn the Cameroons German pastors were interned and German doctors fled to Muni: the French took over much of the colony in 1916 but were in no position to provide replacements. Education collapsed and witchcraft revived. In South-West Africa, the South Africans wisely left the German settlers in place - at least until the peace settlement in 1919.\n\n\n‘We were not fighting for the French’, Kamadon Mbaye, a Senegalese, recalled; ‘we were fighting for ourselves [to become] French citizens.’\n\n\nIn Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, the Sheikh-ul-Islam declared an Islamic holy war against Britain, France, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro on 14 November 1914.\n\n\nIn 1914, of 270 million Muslims in the world in 1914, only about 30 million were governed by other Muslims. Almost 100 million were British subjects; 20 million were under French rule, most of them in North and Equatorial Africa; and another 20 million were incorporated in Russia’s Asian\n\n\nIn 1914, of 270 million Muslims in the world in 1914, only about 30 million were governed by other Muslims. Almost 100 million were British subjects; 20 million were under French rule, most of them in North and Equatorial Africa; and another 20 million were incorporated in Russia’s Asian empire.\n\n\nThe First World War may have been a war in which men were motivated by big ideas, but that of Islam failed to override the loyalties of temporal rule.\n\n\nFrance jockeyed for position in Syria and Palestine. Britain had interests in Iraq, both as a buffer for India and because of the discovery of oil: its first oil-fired battleship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, was laid down in 1912.\n\n\nIdeally, Britain would still have preferred to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war rather than push it in, but nothing it did served that aim. Those in Turkey’s government who espoused neutrality found little to support their policy.\n\n\nHis units were short of boots and groundsheets, and those with the deepest snow to traverse were instructed to leave their packs and greatcoats behind. The mildest temperature in the entire operation was -20°C. The Turks’ supplies ran out on 25 December. The Russians held Sarikamish and then counterattacked in the first week of the new year. The 3rd Army was shattered. Its total casualties were at least 75, men, and some estimates rise as high as 90,. The majority fell not in battle but to the terrain, the climate, the supply situation and the lack of medical care.\n\n\nIt is impossible to say precisely how many Armenians died. Part of the problem is uncertainty as to how many were living in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 in the first place. Calculations range from 1. million to about 2. million.\n\n\nBy the end of 1918 mortality in the coastal towns of Lebanon may have reached 500,000.\n\n\nBoth the Central Powers and the Entente were actively competing for allies in the Balkans. Indeed, the possibility that Greece might side with the British in August 1914, and that therefore its army would be available for use against Turkey, was what had first triggered the Gallipoli idea in Churchill’s mind.\n\n\nBoth the British and the French were convinced of the latent power of the ‘Russian steam-roller’. It seemed to them that Russia had the men to mount the more effective challenge to the Central Powers if only it had the arms with which to equip them.\n\n\nLittle wonder, then, that many Germans thought the Dardanelles campaign was the most important of the war in 1915.\n\n\nThe Turks had plenty of warning that a naval attack up the narrows might be a possibility, and with German help had done much to improve their defences. ‘My first impression’, the American ambassador, Henry Morgenthau, recorded of a tour of the defences, ‘was that I was in Germany\n\n\n18 March an attempt was made to ‘rush through’ the straits using warships in daylight. Carden fell sick on the morning of the attack, and his deputy, Admiral John de Robeck, described what happened as a disaster. Three ships - two British and one French — were sunk by mines. Churchill maintained - as have others — that if the attack had been renewed on the next day it would have succeeded, because the Turks were running low on munitions. They were not\n\n\nThe navy’s major contribution thereafter was also submarine - sinking the Turkish merchant vessels supporting the troops on the peninsula; the Turks lost half their merchant fleet in the campaign.\n\n\nGallipoli has been defined as the moment when Australia came of age as a nation.\n\n\nMost of the Anzac soldiers on whom he reported. They fought not for Australia or New Zealand but for the ‘old country’, with which they still had strong ties of kinship and sentiment\n\n\nMoreover, most of them were city-dwellers, not the bronzed ‘diggers’ from the outback of popular legend. Nor were they necessarily more natural soldiers than any other troops in this war. Morale came close to collapse on 25 April.\n\n\nOnly 30 per cent of British casualties in the campaign (Gallipoli) were sustained in battle.\n\n\nIt was not only Australian and New Zealand national identity that was forged at Gallipoli, it was also Turkey’s. This was a major victory, less for the Ottoman Empire than for the ethnically and geographically more defined state that emerged from the First World War. Moreover, although many of the architects of the defensive battle were German, it produced a Turkish hero who became the founder of that state, Mustafa Kemal.\n\n\nHowever, the supply arrangements of the Russians had been neglected before the war and collapsed as soon as they started their advance.\n\n\nThe chief of the general staff, Moltke, had told him: ‘When the Russians come, not defence only, but offensive, offensive, offensive’.\n\n\nSamsonov confronted the reality. He went off into the forest and shot himself.\n\n\n‘The Germans’, a Russian guards officer recalled, ‘had a line for every army corps and sometimes even for a division … Roughly, the Russian army had one line to supply an army of three or four army corps .\n\n\nBut once the German army operated beyond its own frontier, it was subject to the same constraints as the Russian. That was precisely the reason why Schlieffen had forsaken his predecessors’ predilection for a war in the east and devoted greater attention to Germany’s western front.\n\n\nFalkenhayn and Ludendorff had flared into an open hostility which was to deepen over the next eighteen months and divide strategic counsels in Germany.\n\n\n*But on 4 November Falkenhayn, now publicly appointed chief of the general staff, renewed the attack at Ypres. It failed, with a total German casualty bill of 80,*000\n\n\nThe debate between ‘westerners’ and ’easterners’ in Germany was far more real than the one between soldiers and politicians in Britain that went under the same title.\n\n\nOne can only love or hate’, Ludendorff told Groener, ‘and I hate General von Falkenhayn.’\n\n\nRussian losses since May totaled 1. million men. More than half of them were prisoners of war. And that was true for the war as a whole, not just for the summer of 1915. In a major action on the western front casualties normally divided one-third dead, one-third wounded and one-third captured, and, averaged over the war as a whole, the proportion of prisoners of war in relation to total losses was much smaller.\n\n\nBut Russia’s casualty profile is also revealing of the morale of the Russian army. Before the war the incidence of strikes - which had both soared in number and become increasingly politicised - peaked in July 1914, and conservatives had warned against war for its ability to stoke revolution.\n\n\nRussia had failed to maximise its potential. It raised 15 million men in the war, a massive number in absolute terms, but only 39 percent of its population of military age. France, with a population one-quarter the size of Russia‘s, drafted 79 percent of its male population of military age to create an army half as strong. Britain, which did not introduce conscription until 1916, and which argued that its contribution to the war was industrial and economic, still enlisted 49 percent of its men aged fifteen to forty-nine for military service.\n\n\nMany German Jews were, however, repelled by the Jews of the east, who not only dressed and behaved very differently from themselves but also were more fervent in their beliefs. ‘No, I did not belong to these people, even if one proved my blood relation to them a hundred times over,’ wrote Victor Klem-perer,\n\n\nRussia certainly rallied in an extraordinary fashion in the winter of 1915-. Shell production for field guns rose month on month despite the loss of territory and plant, doubling between May and July 1915 to reach 852, rounds in the latter month, and 1. million in November. Total output in 1915 was 11. million rounds, in 1916 28. million. The strength of the field army, which had fallen to 3. million men in mid-September 1915, recovered to 6. million men by February 1916 and 6. million on 1 June.\n\n\n‘Revolution’, he said, citing Napoleon, ‘is an idea that has found bayonets.’\n\n\nEnzo Valentino, an eighteen-year-old volunteer from Perugia, asked his mother from the front on 3 September, ‘why you persist in imagining and believing a lot of things which I do not write to you? … To be always going forward, and soon to be about to make a great advance? I have never heard anything of all this. As to advancing, it is now a month and a half that I have been up here and always in the same place.’ In the same letter he reported the first fall of the snow. Seven weeks later he was killed by shrapnel fire, an edelweiss in his cap, as he ran forward, shouting ‘Savoia, Savoia, Italia’.\n\n\nThe Serbs suffered the greatest losses in relation to population size of any participant in the war.\n\n\nRelations between Conrad and Falkenhayn became so bad that for almost a full month, between 22 December 1915 and 19 January 1916, there was no direct communication. In that time strategies for 1916 were set.\n\n\nThere are five families of rats in the roof of my dug-out,‘ Captain Bill Murray reported back to his family on 14 May 1915, ’which is two feet above my head in bed, and the little rats practise back somersaults continuously through the night, for they have discovered that my face is a soft landing when they fall.‘\n\n\nThe intensely cultivated soil of Belgium and northern France, well tilled and manured, meant that wounds were rapidly infected with gas gangrene: 21 percent of French soldiers wounded in the legs or thighs died as a result.\n\n\nIn wars before that of 1914- disease, not battle, was the major killer. On the western front it was not - a product of major advances in preventive military medicine as well as of the fact that it was wounds which introduced many of the more life-threatening infections. Disease was still a principal cause of death in every other theatre of war.\n\n\nGerman deaths per month were highest in 1914 on the western front, in 1915 on the eastern front, and in 1918 again in the west - in other words when and where they were on the attack.\n\n\nFrench monthly losses peaked at 238, in September 1914, the month of the Marne. Their next worst month was October 1915, when an offensive in Champagne (which formed the centrepiece of Bernier’s autobiographical novel) pushed the tally up to 180,000. Thereafter they rose above 100,000 on only three occasions in the war, never in 1916 - despite the battle of Verdun - and twice in 1918, when the war became mobile again.\n\n\nLonger hours of daylight in the summer gave more opportunity to kill, although even these major offensives had to close down by November. But\n\n\n*A million helmets, made of hardened manganese steel, were issued to the British army in the first half of 1916, with the result that head wounds fell by over 75 percent\n\n\nThe French were experimenting with helmets when the war broke out, and issued the Adrian helmet in mid-1915.\n\n\nThe quick-firing 75mm field gun, the agent of the French victory on the Marne, could loose fifteen - and some claimed twenty - rounds a minute, and a battery of four guns could fire off its total stock in a couple of hours. Static war minimised the logistical constraints, especially as light railways replaced horse-drawn transport, but increased the numbers of targets.\n\n\n1914 7. million French women already had jobs, and they made up 32 percent of the total workforce; by the war’s end they accounted for 40 percent of the workforce. In Britain women workers rose from just under 6 million, or 26 percent of the workforce, to just\n\n\nIn August 1914 Louis Renault said that his car factories could manufacture shells using turning lathes rather than hydraulic presses. The resulting shell had to be made in two parts because the lathes could not shape the shell’s nose cone. The so-called ‘bi-blocs’ helped overcome France’s shell shortage, but their weaknesses generated shortages in other areas: over 600 French guns were destroyed - and their crews killed or injured - by premature explosions in 1915.\n\n\nGermany likewise used turning lathes to produce what it called ’auxiliary ammunition’ from cast iron: in 1915 it lost 2,000 field guns and 900 light howitzers to premature explosions, as many as were disabled by enemy action.\n\n\nIn January 1915 one German observer reckoned that half the shells fired by the French were duds.\n\n\nAt the battle of the Somme in July 1916 25 percent of British guns were put out of action as a result of design faults and inferior materials, and 30 percent of shells failed to explode.\n\n\nLinear, positional warfare exacerbated this trend, forcing the commander to place himself behind his troops. The German response to the problem was to delegate command forward, confining instructions to general directives and avoiding detailed orders. British officers were used to smaller forces and more hands-on command in colonial campaigns.\n\n\nBritish generals were in fact ‘too eager to get away from their desks’. What they found hard to accept was that vital decisions were being taken at lower levels of authority.\n\n\nTotal Entente losses reached a quarter of a million for minimal gain. Foiled in his attempt at breakthrough, Joffre fell back on another rationale for his attack: ‘We shall kill more of the enemy than he can kill of us’.\n\n\nHaig, however, decided that Verdun had fulfilled the function of the wearing-out battle and that he now had the opportunity to break through. He wanted a hurricane bombardment and a deeper and faster advance: ’D. H. is for breaking the line and gambling on rushing the third line on top of a panic,‘ Rawlinson wrote in his diary on 1 April.\n\n\nTawney survived to become a famous historian, but of the 57,000 British casualties that day 19,000 did not. Nowhere had the advance reached its objectives.\n\n\nBetween mid-July and mid-September Haig convinced himself that the Germans were ‘off balance’ and about to collapse. Many of the ninety attacks launched in this period were small affairs: ill-coordinated, hurried and launched on narrow fronts, they gained under three square miles of ground for 82, casualties. Haig rationalised his failure to achieve breakthrough by saying that his purpose was now attrition.\n\n\nBecause in time of war the state gave priority to feeding its direct defenders, the soldier and the factory worker, those most likely to suffer from shortages were the militarily useless, the old and the weak. Death rates among epileptics in Bethel, near Bielefeld, rose from 3. percent in 1914 to 16. percent in 1917, and in all Prussian sanatoriums from 9. percent to 28. percent\n\n\nGermany produced enough food to feed itself in the war. On the basis that an average daily intake of 2, calories was the norm, the German population experienced real hardship only in the months immediately after the failed harvest of 1916. In February 1917 daily rations dropped to 1, calories per person. This so-called ‘turnip winter’ - when turnips replaced potatoes - makes the point. Germans saw the turnip as animal feed.\n\n\nThe War Food Office, created in 1916 under the auspices of the Prussian Ministry of War, recognised ’the meaningful influence that coffee and quasi-coffee drinks had on the general morale of the population‘, and deemed it a ’most important food‘.\n\n\nOver 800 types of substitute sausage were recognised by the war’s end, and over 10, other Ersatz foods. Indeed Ersatz itself ceased to mean substitute and came to mean fake.\n\n\nIn July 1916 the Germans court-martialled Charles Fryatt, master of the Brussels, a British merchant vessel, on the grounds that on 28 March 1915 he had attempted to ram a U-boat although not himself a member of a combatant service. Fryatt was executed. In terms of propaganda and diplomatic effect, Fryatt’s ‘deliberate murder’, as the New York Times called it, worked in Britain’s favour.\n\n\nAfter March 1918 a woman with venereal disease could be arrested for having sex with her husband if he were a serviceman, even if he had first infected her.\n\n\nMoving coal by rail from the Donets basin and the Urals to factories in the north-west further depleted what was available to the end user. Blast furnaces fell idle for lack of fuel.\n\n\nIn January 1917, an agent of the secret police reported that ‘Children are starving in the most literal sense of the word. A revolution’, he concluded, ‘if it takes place will be spontaneous, quite likely a hunger riot.’\n\n\nThe strategic logic was now the reverse of that adopted in December: the Italians were also not ready to attack, so that now the western front offensive was justified precisely because there were not going to be attacks on the other fronts.\n\n\nFast-acting graze fuses meant that shells did not bury themselves in the ground, breaking it up and losing their force, but exploded on impact, and in particular cut barbed wire. This firepower was used more discriminatingly: bombardments elsewhere along the line deceived the enemy as to the true point of attack, and intelligence focused the guns on the key sectors. Of nearly 1,000 heavy guns, 377 were concentrated on a 6-km front facing Vimy Ridge, a high point commanding the plain to Douai and the east.\n\n\nThe deterioration in the weather slowed the attack in subsequent days, but so did the impossibility of progressing beyond the range of effective artillery support: in the case of field artillery cutting wire, this was about 2, yards. However, the battle of Arras achieved its principal strategic objective: the Germans doubled their strength in the sector within a week.\n\n\nNivelle had collected enough guns on his 40-km front to allocate one field gun and one trench mortar for every 23 metres and one heavy gun for every 21 metres. But the depth of the German positions meant that the number of guns per metre of enemy trench was half that. The Germans had ample intelligence of French intentions, and they had 100 machine-guns for every 1, yards of front.\n\n\nAt Berry-au-Bac and Juvincourt, tanks, used in numbers for the first time by the French, carried so much petrol that some caught fire, and the remainder outstripped the exhausted infantry meant to accompany them. By the end of the first day, of 132 tanks 57 had been destroyed and 64 had become bogged\n\n\nOn 8 May Pétain was appointed to succeed Nivelle as commander-in-chief. He responded to the complaints about leave and rest. He handled the mutinies with restraint: of 629 soldiers condemned to death between May and October 1917, only 43 were executed. But he also embarked on a programme of political education for the troops, emphasising the wider strategy of the war and the contribution to its purpose that the United States’s entry would make.\n\n\nHaig saw what was in front of him, and interpreted that in the best possible light: his devout Presbyterianism gave him an inner certainty which interpreted setbacks as challenges, a not undesirable quality in a commander. He believed he could achieve a breakthrough in 1917, and would rationalise his battle as attrition only if he failed.\n\n\nNor did the total number of courts martial rise exponentially, particularly when set against the increasing size of the army. An end-of-year report based on 17,000 letters concluded that morale was sound. The traditional paternalism of a long-service army - rest and recreation, food and drink, good officer-men relations - acted as an effective disciplinary tool even for conscripts. The British army did not mutiny - at least, not on a scale which bears comparison with the French.\n\n\nThe four battles on the River Isonzo in 1915 were followed by five more in 1916, and two in 1917.\n\n\nCadorna attributed his defeat not to tactical incompetence but to anti-militarism and defeatism in Italy as a whole.\n\n\nIn Britain Haig’s standing slumped in the aftermath of Passchendaele. Lloyd George now possessed the political authority to remove him, if he could find a credible alternative.\n\n\nThe new Chief of the Imperial General Staff was General Sir Henry Wilson, an Irish unionist and a man whose love of intrigue was so great that the sight of a politician was said to induce in him a state of sexual excitement. Haig both distrusted and disliked him.\n\n\nArthur Zimmermann convinced the Kaiser and the army that the Bolsheviks’ leader, Lenin, who was living in exile in Switzerland, should\n\n\nThe treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest defined what a German victory meant. ‘For those who think Germany will be satisfied with a peace of conciliation’, wrote a French gunner, the Russians’ cowardice ‘will have made them see what defeat would mean on our front.\n\n\nRussia and Romania were not the only losers at Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest. So, too, were advocates everywhere of a negotiated peace, and they included liberals in Germany.\n\n\n‘Great indignation with the Kaiser who spends hours supervising the building of a fountain at Homburg, for which a war contractor has raised the money’, wrote Georg von Müller in his diary on 7 August 1916. While his soldiers slogged it out at Verdun and on the Somme, ‘He went for an excursion to Saalburg and Friedrichshof this afternoon and refused to read a report from Hindenburg on the situation on the Eastern Front because “he had no time”’.\n\n\nUnable to hold the line, Falkenhayn pulled back to the hills north of Jerusalem, resting his right flank on Jaffa. In February 1918 he was recalled to Germany, but not before he had intervened to prevent the resettlement of the Jews; they were reckoned to be spying, but neither the Germans nor Talât, elevated to become Ottoman Grand Vizier in February 1917, wanted a repeat of the Armenian massacres.\n\n\nAll told, about 1. million soldiers, albeit older and less fit than those in the west, remained on the eastern front in 1918. They ate a great deal of the food that they were trying to procure for their civilian populations.\n\n\nMoreover, the root cause of food shortages in the Habsburg Empire, and a contributory factor in Germany itself, was transport.\n\n\nHoltzendorff had calculated that, if Germany could sink 600,000 tons of British shipping a month for five months, Britain would have to make peace. The navy delivered: it sank 860,000 tons in April, and exceeded its target in May and June. Given that it had only about thirty submarines on station at any one time, that was a remarkable achievement: before the war it was thought 222 would be needed for an effective blockade of Britain.\n\n\n‘Look well at the loaf on your breakfast table and treat it as if it were real gold,’ declared Kennedy Jones, director-general of food economy, in a speech in Edinburgh in May 1917, ‘because the British loaf is going to beat the German.’\n\n\nNeither Hindenburg nor Ludendorff would do so, especially when they and others were increasingly thinking in terms of the ‘Second Punic War’. If the current world war did not secure the full package of German war aims, it would have to be followed by another.\n\n\nThird, many of the fronts, particularly the principal one in the west, were genuinely shared responsibilities. Germany shored up the western front single-handedly, but then on other fronts could expect its allies to act as virtual mercenaries, providing the cannon fodder for German commanders to use according to German priorities. There were Entente fronts, pre-eminently the Italian, which were largely sustained by the army of one nation, but that army sustained its legitimacy by acting in conformity with its own national objectives.\n\n\n’I shall fight without ceasing‘, he was reported to have said to a group of officers. ’I shall fight in front of Amiens. I shall fight in Amiens. I shall fight behind Amiens. I shall fight all the time.‘\n\n\nIt also had few tanks. The French had attacked with 375 Renault light tanks on 18 July. These were the brainchild of Jean-Baptiste Estienne, a French artillery officer, whose service in an aviation unit before the war had awoken him to the possibilities of inter-arm tactical cooperation.\n\n\nThe breakdown rate of tanks in the First World War was very high - the speed pf most ranged between 2 and 4 mph across country - and their range was restricted. The argument that the British had forfeited their surprise value by using them prematurely on the Somme in September 1916 is nonsense: here was an imperfect but evolving weapon which needed the benefit of combat experience.\n\n\nThe tank was the most striking evidence of a number of points: that the Entente tackled the integration of science, technology and tactics with greater success than the Germans; that the link between tactical experience and factory production was a continuous loop, involving fresh blueprints and the rejigging of machine-tools and plant, as well as feeding munitions into the battle; that by 1918 the Entente, not the Central Powers,\n\n\nThe tank was the most striking evidence of a number of points: that the Entente tackled the integration of science, technology and tactics with greater success than the Germans; that the link between tactical experience and factory production was a continuous loop, involving fresh blueprints and the rejigging of machine-tools and plant, as well as feeding munitions into the battle; that by 1918 the Entente, not the Central Powers, derived greater benefit from the trade-off between the mass army and mass production; and that the ultimate benefit was on the battlefield, in the reintegration of fire and movement.\n\n\nIn the last year of the war, Britain, France and the United States jointly produced an average of 11,000 machines and 14,000 aero engines per month; the German equivalents were each below 2,000\n\n\nThe biggest single intellectual shift in making war between 1914 and 1918 was that the combined-arms battle was planned around the capabilities of the guns rather than of the infantry.\n\n\nBy November the Royal Artillery had perfected the techniques of predicted fire. It used microphones to record from different points the low-frequency sound waves following the firing of a gun in order to take a cross-bearing and locate the position of an enemy battery. Unlike aerial observation or the visual spotting of gun flashes, both also methods of immense value in identifying targets, sound-ranging could be used in bad visibility. Consequently, artillery could register its guns in advance of an attack without the preliminary bombardment that had squandered surprise in the past, particularly when the tanks could themselves take on the tasks of crushing wire and destroying enemy machine-gun nests.\n\n\nIn a war in which 70 per cent of all casualties were attributed to artillery it was a fatal weakness.\n\n\nBritish non-battle casualties in Macedonia exceeded battle casualties by twenty to one.\n\n\nVenizelos argued that joining the Entente would open the door to a greater Greece, and in 1916 secured the Entente’s recognition for a provisional government in Thessalonica.\n\n\nRevolutions broke out in Vienna and Budapest on 31 October. Austria secured an armistice on 3 November*\n\n\nFor them the most direct consequence was the continuation of the blockade until the peace treaty was signed. Moreover, with no effective opposition and with unfettered access to the one sea that had remained a German enclave, the Baltic, the allies were able to apply it with a level of severity that had eluded them in the war. The winter of 1918-, even more than the war years, determined the Germans’ and Austrians’ folk memories of hunger as an instrument of war.\n\n\nBefore the peace treaty was signed one member of the British delegation, John Maynard Keynes, resigned in protest at the harshness of the terms, and then published a hugely successful popular book in order to damn its economic clauses. The Economic Consequences of the Peace prepared the way for liberal doubters, who were further exploited by the Germans’ response to article 231 of the treaty.\n\n\nAbout 10 million soldiers died in the war. Twice that number bore the scars of wounds, some so mutilated in body or mind as to be unfit for further work and unable to lead fulfilled lives.\n\n\nGlobally up to 20 million succumbed in the influenza epidemic which swept from Asia through Europe and on to America in 1918-1919. But the bereaved were not forgotten, because one of the purposes of mourning was to remember.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Persons/The-Man-from-the-Future-The-Visionary-Life-of-John-von-Neumann":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Persons/The-Man-from-the-Future-The-Visionary-Life-of-John-von-Neumann","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Persons/The Man from the Future The Visionary Life of John von Neumann.md","title":"The Man from the Future The Visionary Life of John von Neumann","links":[],"tags":["books","biography","non-fiction","mathematics","mathematics/game-theory","physics/quantum-physics","physics","biology"],"content":"The Man from the Future The Visionary Life of John von Neumann\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the fascinating life of John von Neumann. It describes the work and the ramifications of the work he ventured on. Things like game theory, the biology of cell automata, economics, physics, mathematics, and computer science are all fields either founded or drastically influenced by the work of John von Neumann.\n🎨 Impressions\nI have always had a soft spot for one of the most influential scientists of all time, and I was astonished by the amount of work that was done by John von Neumann.\nThis book is a goldmine of a story of the scientific and cultural shift from Europe to America, and the golden age of scientific discovery during the first 50 years of the 20th century.\nHow I Discovered It\nI think it popped up when I was browsing around in Amason for books and it sounded like a book I would like to read.\nWho Should Read It?\nI think this is a good book for anyone who likes to read biographies and is interested in science. It does not contain any math so rest assured, it will be a good read.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nIt is just so interesting for me to read about how drastic the shift from Europe to America was, it was insane how much brainpower shifted to the Americas. I am astonished about how increasingly effective the purges of intellectuals from Germany by the Nazi party were, they removed most of the tools they had to contribute to their insane war effort.\nAlso, the tragic fate of some of the characters, such as Godel, Nash, and others, shows the dark side of the human mind and how one should be thankful for not only the gifts one receives but also the curses one does not.\nReading this and seeing the movie Oppenheimer made me be aware of a lot of different aspects that the movie missed.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n‘If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.’ John von Neumann\n\n\n‘Von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my three-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.’ Edward Teller\n\n\nCreated when the old capital of Buda was merged with the nearby cities of Óbuda and Pest in 1873, Budapest was thriving.\n\n\nIn 1910, a quarter of Budapest’s population, and more than half of its doctors, lawyers, and bankers, were Jewish, as were many of those involved in the city’s thriving cultural scene.\n\n\nEqually, von Neumann had no interest in sport and, barring long walks (always in a business suit), he would avoid any form of vigorous physical exercise for the rest of his life. When his second wife, Klári, tried to persuade him to ski, he offered her a divorce.\n\n\n‘Mathematics is the foundation of all exact knowledge of natural phenomena.’ David Hilbert, 1900\n\n\n‘Johnny’s unique gift as a mathematician was to transform problems in all areas of mathematics into problems of logic,’ says Freeman Dyson.\n\n\n‘My opinions have been violently opposed to Marxism ever since I remember,’ he told a congressional confirmation hearing in 1955, after he was nominated to the Atomic Energy Commission, ‘and quite in particular since I had about a three-month taste of it in Hungary in 1919.’\n\n\nDisplaying a sensitivity towards the feelings of others that are not always found in those with remarkable brains, von Neumann took care not to be overbearing yet could not but help stand apart. ‘Whenever I talked with von Neumann,’ Wigner said of his friend, ‘I always had the impression that only he was fully awake, that I was halfway in a dream.’\n\n\nThe next leap forward in geometry was taken by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, about twenty years after Bolyai and Lobachevsky. Riemann’s doctoral thesis, now recognized as one of the greatest ever produced in mathematics, was of a gloriously fertile originality,’ said Carl Friedrich Gauss, the most famous mathematician of the age. While Bolyai and Lobachevsky pictured planes that curved through space, Riemann’s surfaces often twisted and contorted in ways that could barely be imagined at all. His mathematics could describe space with any number of dimensions – hyperspace – just as easily as the three familiar spatial ones. More than half a century later, Riemann’s geometry would prove ‘admirably appropriate’ for describing the warped four-dimensional spacetime of Einstein’s general relativity.\n\n\n‘Ignoramus et ignorabimus,’ as he put it: ‘we do not know and will not know’.\n\n\n‘God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man,’ growled Leopold Kronecker, a contemporary grandee of German mathematics who found Cantor’s juggling with infinities suspicious and distasteful\n\n\nHis analysis of the paradox revealed it to be similar in form to several others, including the liar’s paradox (‘this statement is a lie’). ‘It seemed unworthy of a grown man to spend time on such trivialities,’\n\n\nIn Göttingen, Hilbert reacted angrily. Whereas once he had supported Brouwer’s application for a chair at the University of Amsterdam, he now campaigned for him to be removed from the board of editors of Mathematische Annalen, one of the field’s most prestigious journals. Einstein, one of the editors, dismissed the feud as a completely overblown Froschmäusekrieg (literally a war of frogs and mice, a German phrase describing a bitter but unimportant altercation).\n\n\nI don’t maintain that I understood everything, but enough to see that this was outstanding work and to recognize ex ungue leonem.’ ‘To know the lion by his claw’ – the Latin words uttered by Johann Bernoulli 200 years earlier, on recognizing by its brilliance an anonymous work by Isaac Newton.\n\n\nAfter 379 pages, Russell and his co-author Alfred North Whitehead were able to prove that 1+1=2 (‘The above proposition is occasionally useful,’ read the wry comment accompanying their proof).\n\n\nHe was twenty-two. Hilbert, one of the examiners, is alleged to have asked just one question. ‘In all my years I have never seen such beautiful evening clothes: pray, who is the candidate’s tailor?’\n\n\n‘If only I knew more mathematics!’ Erwin Schrödinger, 1925\n\n\n‘The more successes the quantum theory enjoys, the more stupid it looks,’ said Einstein, who realized early on that the shotgun wedding of classical and quantum concepts could not last.\n\n\nThe core ideas in Heisenberg’s revolutionary paper were assembled during a two-week stay in June 1925 at Heligoland, a sparsely inhabited rock shaped like a wizard’s hat that lies some 30 miles north of the German coast. Puffed up by a severe attack of hay fever, the outdoorsman had gone to take the pollen-free North Sea air, hiking and swimming and hoping for a breakthrough that would make sense of the puzzles thrown up by Bohr’s work.\n\n\nHe showed what he described as his ‘crazy paper’ to Born, who encouraged him to publish, writing to Einstein that it was ‘rather mystifying’ but also ‘true and profound’. Only after the paper was in print did Born remember that he had been taught about similar arrays years earlier.\n\n\nAnxious to make his name with a big discovery, Schrödinger worked through a two-week tryst with an ex-lover in an Alpine resort that Christmas, returning to Zurich in January to apply his new wave equation to some of the key problems that were being thrown up by atomic physics. ‘A late erotic outburst’ was how Hermann Weyl, a close friend of Schrödinger (and his wife’s lover), would describe the deluge of academic papers that were to follow. Among them was a complete description of the hydrogen atom spectrum based on his theory and a version of his equation that showed how the waves evolved over time.\n\n\nHeisenberg was even blunter about the failings of Schrödinger’s wave mechanics. ‘It’s crap,’ he wrote to Pauli. He was particularly disturbed by the physical picture that Schrödinger was trying to paint of the atom’s inner workings.\n\n\nPaul Dirac, whom novelist Ian McEwan describes as ‘a man entirely claimed by science, bereft of small talk and other human skills’. His Cambridge colleagues even named a unit of speech after him: a ‘dirac’ amounted to a single, solitary word per hour.\n\n\nPaul Dirac, whom novelist Ian McEwan describes as ‘a man entirely claimed by science, bereft of small talk and other human skills’. His Cambridge colleagues even named a unit of speech after him: a ‘dirac’ amounted to a single, solitary word per hour. Dirac would later fall in love with and marry Margit Wigner, the sister of Johnny’s school friend Eugene. He would even learn to tell a joke or two. But in the 1920s, the young Dirac was a man who cared little for anything other than advanced physics and who, in the words of Freeman Dyson, ‘seemed to be able to conjure laws of nature from pure thought’.\n\n\nGerman, not English, was the language of science in the 1920s. Practically all the founding papers of quantum mechanics were written in it. There was a flood of congresses and conferences for young researchers to attend.\n\n\nVon Neumann’s usual approach to giving seminars was not to spoil them by over-preparing. He would often think through what he might say on the train journey to the conference, turn up at the seminar with no notes and then race through the maths. If he filled up the blackboard, he would rub out a swathe of earlier equations and plough on. Those not as quick on the uptake as he was – i.e. nearly everyone – referred to his inimitable seminar style as ‘proof by erasure’.\n\n\nAbraham Pais recalled ‘that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it’.\n\n\nThe scheme to entice the two Hungarians had been cooked up by Oswald Veblen, a distinguished Princeton professor of mathematics. America was an intellectual backwater and Veblen wanted to change that by poaching some of Europe’s most brilliant mathematicians with the offer of huge American salaries. He had secured millions of dollars from the Rockefeller foundation and wealthy private donors to erect a grand new building, named Fine Hall, for the mathematics department. Now he just needed the mathematicians to fill it.\n\n\n‘Jancsi felt at home in America from the first day,’ Wigner continued. ‘He was a cheerful man, an optimist who loved money and believed firmly in human progress. Such men were far more common in the United States than in the Jewish circles of central Europe.’\n\n\n‘I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission,’ he retorted. ‘We are a university, not a bath house.’\n\n\nOne of the first acts of the new regime was to introduce the ‘Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service’, which called for the removal of Jewish employees and anyone with communist leanings. In Germany, university staff are officially appointed and paid directly by the government. About 5 per cent of all civil servants lost their jobs. But physics and mathematics departments were devastated: 15 per cent of physicists and 18. per cent of mathematicians were dismissed.\n\n\nTwenty of the ousted researchers were either already Nobel laureates or future recipients of the prize. Some 80 per cent were Jews.\n\n\nBack in Princeton, Wigner faced a quandary. Princeton had extended his contract for five years along with von Neumann’s but he felt guilty about turning his back on Europe. He turned to his friend for advice. ‘Von Neumann,’ Wigner said, ‘asked me a simple question: Why should we stay in a part of the world where we are no longer welcome?\n\n\nIn June that same year, von Neumann wrote to Veblen: ‘If these boys continue for only two more years (which is unfortunately very probable), they will ruin German science for a generation – at least.’\n\n\nThe economist Fabian Waldinger recently analysed the impact of the dismissals on German research. Scientific productivity dropped like a stone: researchers produced a third fewer papers than before. The ‘Aryan’ scientists recruited to replace those forced to leave were generally of a lower calibre. He found that university science departments that were bombed during the war recovered by the 1960s, but those that had lost staff remained sub-par well into the 1980s. ‘These calculations suggest that the dismissal of scientists in Nazi Germany contributed about nine times more to the decline of German science than physical destruction during WWII,’\n\n\nHeisenberg stayed, only to be branded a ‘white Jew’ for his adherence to the theories of Einstein.\n\n\nNext year, when Rust attended a banquet at Göttingen, he asked Hilbert whether it was true that mathematics had suffered after the removal of Jews. ‘Suffered?’ replied Hilbert. ‘It hasn’t suffered, Herr Minister. It just doesn’t exist anymore\n\n\nBohr: I don’t think anyone has yet discovered a way you can use theoretical physics to kill people. Michael Frayn, Copenhagen, 1998\n\n\n‘You and I could have a lot of fun together,’ he told her, ‘for instance, you like to drink wine and so do I.’\n\n\nNext, there was the problem of getting about. Von Neumann enjoyed driving very much but had never passed a test. At Mariette’s suggestion, he bribed a driving examiner. This did nothing to improve his driving.\n\n\nHe sped along crowded roads as if they were many-body problems to be negotiated by calculating the best route through on the fly. He often failed, and an intersection in Princeton was soon christened ‘von Neumann corner’ on account of the many accidents he had there.\n\n\nEnvious Princetonians dubbed the moneyed academy a stone’s throw away ‘the Institute for Advanced Salaries’ and ‘the Institute for Advanced Lunch’. Unused to the gilded existence, some professors would lapse into somnolence. ‘These poor bastards could now sit and think clearly all by themselves, OK?’ wrote one critic, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. ‘They have every opportunity to do something, and they’re not getting any ideas … Nothing happens because there’s not enough real activity and challenge:\n\n\nHe feared that during that war, European Jews would suffer a genocide as the Armenians had under the Ottoman Empire. In 1940, he predicted that Britain would be able to hold a German invasion at bay (far from obvious at the time), and that America would join the war the following year (as it did after the bombing of Pearl Harbor).\n\n\n‘Johnny preferred admirals to generals, because the generals drank iced water for lunch, while the admirals when ashore drank liquor,’ said Leslie Simon, a director of the BRL.\n\n\nThe massive effort to build the atom bomb, codenamed Project Y, would cost the US billion (more than billion today) and at its height employ more than 100, people. In September 1942, the forty-six-year-old Army engineer Leslie Groves was appointed to lead it. The very next month, Groves chose Oppenheimer to head the top-secret laboratory that would develop the bomb.\n\n\nWorst of all, from the military’s standpoint, he was a left-winger whose closest associates – his girlfriend, wife, brother and sister-in-law – had been, and perhaps still were, members of the Communist Party. Even Oppenheimer’s landlady in Berkeley was a communist.\n\n\nThese facts would be used to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954, a public act of humiliation that effectively ended his work for the government.\n\n\nVon Neumann was irked when newspapers reported that he had received the medal for showing that a ‘miss was better than a hit’. He had actually discovered that large bombs cause far more damage over a wider area when they are detonated in the air above their target than on the ground. The principle was well known, but von Neumann showed that the effect of an airburst was much larger than previously thought,\n\n\nOppenheimer reached for poetry, recalling a verse from ancient Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, which he had read in the original Sanskrit. ‘Now I am become Death,’ he said, ‘the destroyer of worlds.’ Bainbridge was pithier. ‘Now we are all sons of bitches,’ he told Oppenheimer.\n\n\nIn the end, Truman sidled over to the Russian leader and told him that the United States now possessed a ‘new weapon of unusual destructive force’. Stalin, completely unperturbed, told him to make good use of it. Spies in the Manhattan Project had long ago told Stalin everything he needed to know.\n\n\nShortly after the end of the war, Stalin asked Truman to grant his ‘modest wish’ to occupy Hokkaido, Japan’s second-largest island. Truman refused. Possession of the atom bomb had stiffened the resolve of the American government.\n\n\nOn 6 August, the Enola Gay took off before dawn from Tinian. Good weather allowed Little Boy to be dropped on the primary target of Hiroshima, but a crosswind blew the bomb away from the aiming point, Aioi Bridge, so that it detonated 1, feet ( metres) above Shima hospital, modelled by its founder on the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\nThe explosion, equivalent to about 17, tons of TNT, and the resulting firestorm killed some 70, people, mostly civilians. Many thousands more would die from burns and radiation poisoning by the end of the year.\n\n\nLittle Boy and Fat Man claimed more lives in minutes than the senseless firebombing of Dresden by hundreds of Allied (mostly British) aircraft. No decision of such magnitude should pass into the annals of history unscrutinized, and no schoolchild taught to accept uncritically that the horrors visited on the citizens of those two cities can be justified.\n\n\n‘I began to look backward and ask myself how it happened that I let myself become involved in this crazy game of murder,’ he says. ‘Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all.’\n\n\nintellectually dynamic but psychologically frail Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel would demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that mathematics is either complete or consistent. Five years after Gödel’s breakthrough, a twenty-three-year-old Turing would attack Hilbert’s ‘decision problem’ (Entscheidungsproblem) in a way completely unanticipated by any other logician, conjuring up an imaginary machine to show that mathematics is not decidable\n\n\nOne can,’ he ventured modestly, ‘even give examples of propositions (and in fact of those of the type of Goldbach or Fermat) that, while contentually true, are unprovable in the formal system of classical mathematics.’ In other words, there are truths in mathematics that cannot be proven by mathematics. Mathematics is not complete.\n\n\nGödel had announced one of the foremost intellectual feats of the twentieth century. He must have been rather piqued when the response to this revelation was even more muted than the perfunctory praise that had greeted his thesis. The assemblage politely ignored his carefully prepared one-sentence bombshell as if he had cracked a bad joke at a dinner party.\n\n\nYet it appears that only one person grasped the import of Gödel’s achievement well enough to want to know more. After the round table was over, von Neumann, there as a trusted evangelist for Hilbert’s programme, grabbed Gödel by the sleeve and steered him to a quiet corner to grill him about his methods.\n\n\nThe following day Hilbert gave his retirement address, a passionate speech in which he declared again there were no unsolvable problems in mathematics and uttered the words that would become the epitaph on his gravestone: We must know – we will know. But Gödel had already proved him wrong.\n\n\nAt the heart of Gödel’s proof was a restatement of the liar’s paradox. In its usual form, the paradox can be phrased: ‘This sentence is false.’ Awkwardly, this is only true if it is false – a fact that has tied grammarians and logicians in knots for centuries.\n\n\nWhile others were still grappling with Gödel’s work, von Neumann immediately understood what Hilbert, and even Gödel himself, would struggle to accept. ‘My personal opinion,’ he said, ‘which is shared by many others, is that Gödel has shown that Hilbert’s program is essentially hopeless.’ Von Neumann called Gödel the greatest logician since Aristotle and gave up working on the foundations of mathematics.\n\n\nWhen, after Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany in 1938, Gödel was denied a post at the University of Vienna partly for having ‘always travelled in liberal-Jewish circles’, von Neumann would campaign to bring him to the IAS. ‘Gödel is absolutely irreplaceable; he is the only mathematician alive about whom I would dare to make this statement,’ he wrote to Flexner. ‘Salvaging him from the wreck of Europe is one of the great single contributions anyone could make to science at this moment.’\n\n\nHe was successful. In Princeton, Gödel became convinced that the radiators and refrigerator in his home were emitting poisonous gas and had them removed, shivering through his first few winters. He would sometimes wander into von Neumann’s house in his absence, pick up a book and start reading. Once he had finished, he would replace the book and leave – all without saying a word to von Neumann’s young wife.\n\n\nHe was successful. In Princeton, Gödel became convinced that the radiators and refrigerator in his home were emitting poisonous gas and had them removed, shivering through his first few winters. He would sometimes wander into von Neumann’s house in his absence, pick up a book and start reading. Once he had finished, he would replace the book and leave – all without saying a word to von Neumann’s young wife. He often walked home from the institute with Einstein, engrossed in gentle disagreements about politics, physics and philosophy. The solemn young logician and the gregarious physicist, now in his sixties, made an odd couple but nonetheless derived great pleasure from each other’s company.\n\n\nLike Schrödinger’s famous description of an alive-dead cat, published exactly twelve months earlier, Turing’s machine was a thought experiment. ‘Schrödinger was not trying to advance the state of the art of feline euthanasia,’ says Haigh. ‘Neither was Turing proposing the construction of a new kind of calculating machine.’\n\n\nComputer designers now refer to the whole configuration as the ‘von Neumann architecture’, and nearly all computers in use today – smart phones, laptops, desktops – are built according to its precepts.\n\n\nComputer designers now refer to the whole configuration as the ‘von Neumann architecture’, and nearly all computers in use today – smart phones, laptops, desktops – are built according to its precepts. The design’s fundamental drawback, now called the ‘von Neumann bottleneck’, is that instructions or data have to be found and fetched serially from memory – like standing in a line, and being able to pass messages only forwards or backwards. That task takes much longer than any subsequent processing. That handicap is outweighed by the architecture’s considerable advantages, which stem from its simplicity.\n\n\nWhat had become the longest trial in the history of the federal court system concluded with the ruling that the most valuable invention of the twentieth century could not be patented. The open source movement, born a decade or so later, would soon shun corporate secrecy, lauding the benefits of freely sharing information to drive forward innovation. Thanks to von Neumann those principles were baked into computing from the very beginning.\n\n\nAround this time, he met an old friend, Gleb Wataghin, a Russian-Italian physicist who had recently returned from Brazil. ‘I suppose you are not interested in mathematics anymore,’ Wataghin teased. ‘I hear you are now thinking about nothing but bombs.’ ‘That is quite wrong,’ von Neumann replied. ‘I am thinking about something much more important than bombs. I am thinking about computers.’\n\n\nUlam realized that many real-world problems are surprisingly similar in nature to working out the chances of winning solitaire. A complex situation can be made tractable by setting up a model that is then run repeatedly to reveal the most likely outcomes. ‘It’s infinitely cheaper to imitate a physical process in a computer and make experiments on paper, as it were, rather than reality,’ Ulam explained later. Monte Carlo made simulating a chain reaction possible for the first time. There are a vast number of different ways in which an assembly of neutrons might behave – too many to calculate.\n\n\nBy the 1960s, IBM manufactured about 70 per cent of the world’s electronic computers. ‘Probably’, Teller told his biographers, ‘the IBM company owes half its money to Johnny von Neumann.’\n\n\n‘A tidal wave of computational power was about to break and inundate everything in science and much elsewhere, and things would never be the same.’\n\n\n‘Omar Little: I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase. It’s all in the game, though, right?’ From The Wire, 2003\n\n\nchild custody arrangements that he and his first wife Mariette came up with for their daughter, Marina, when she was just two years old. The two agreed that until the age of twelve, Marina would live with her mother and spend holidays with her father. After that, when she was ‘approaching the age of reason’, Marina would live with her father to receive the benefit of his genius.\n\n\n‘It was a thoughtful and well-intentioned agreement,’ Marina says in her memoirs, ‘but they were too inexperienced to realize that adolescence is often the stage in life farthest removed from the age of reason.’\n\n\nGame theory sprang from von Neumann’s urge to find neat mathematical solutions to knotty real-world problems during one of the most ‘disorderly and irrational’ periods in human history. The answers of game theory sometimes seem cold, unconventional, shorn of the complexities of human emotion\n\n\n‘No, no,’ he said. ‘Chess is not a game. Chess is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the answers, but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position.\n\n\n‘It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail,’ Iris Murdoch once wrote.\n\n\nVon Neumann coined the term ‘zero-sum’ to describe such games of total conflict, in which one person’s loss is the other’s gain. One indication of the influence of game theory is that ‘zero-sum’ has now passed into the vernacular.\n\n\n‘Other mathematicians prove what they can,’ she declared, ‘von Neumann proves what he wants.’\n\n\nHe delivered the unscripted talk in German, and though most present could be expected to have understood him, von Neumann’s machine-gun delivery accompanied by his usual habit of wiping the blackboard clean before anyone could catch up with him probably explained why his thoughts did not immediately reach a wider audience.\n\n\nPrivately, he was less diplomatic. ‘If these books are unearthed sometime a few hundred years hence, people will not believe that they were written in our time,’ von Neumann confided to a friend in 1947, referring to some of the discipline’s most lauded contemporary works. ‘Rather they will think that they are about contemporary with Newton, so primitive is their mathematics. Economics is simply still a million miles away from the state in which an advanced science is, such as physics.’\n\n\ndiscovered principally through the Jewish economist Ludwig von Mises the classical liberalism of the Austrian School. Mises’s belief in the power of free markets put him at odds with other Jewish professors, who were mostly left-leaning progressives. Without their support, Mises was unable to overcome the general antipathy of the gentile faculty and never secured a tenured position. He was still extraordinarily influential.\n\n\nMorgenstern was deemed ‘politically unbearable’ and summarily dismissed from his job. The Anschluss appears to have cured Morgenstern of his anti-Semitism. The snide jibes aimed at Jews largely disappear from his diaries after 1938. His own family in Austria were forced to prove their Aryan ancestry (which they did, back to the 1500s).\n\n\nposition at the Institute,’ he grumbled. Morgenstern found Princeton to be much as Einstein had described it five years earlier; ‘a quaint and ceremonious village of puny demigods on stilts’.\n\n\n‘Economists simply don’t know what science means,’ he complained privately. ‘I am quite disgusted with all of this garbage.’ John Maynard Keynes, whose thinking shaped government policy the world over for much of the twentieth century, was ‘one of the biggest charlatans who has ever appeared on the economic scene’, said Morgenstern. ‘And everybody is on their belly before him.’\n\n\nBetween helping to invent the design principles of digital circuits and modern information theory, American mathematician Claude Shannon calculated that there are at least 10120 possible games of chess – comfortably more than the number of elementary particles in the universe.\n\n\nPoker is a game of imperfect information. In many ways, it is the game of imperfect information. That a player does not know what cards other participants are holding is what makes the game fun and exciting at all. An optimal strategy for poker must embrace this uncertainty.\n\n\nHowever, a smart opponent will quickly depart from their ‘optimal’ strategy by passing whenever the non-bluffing player bids high and throwing in more bluffs themselves. As Binmore says, ‘The point of bluffing is not so much that you might win with a bad hand, as that you want to encourage the opposition to bet with middle-range hands when you have a good hand.’\n\n\n‘Zero-sum games are to the theory of games what the twelve-bar blues is to jazz: a polar case, and a historical point of departure,’ says economist Michael Bacharach.\n\n\nBy the time von Neumann and Morgenstern embarked on their opus in the 1940s, economists had begun to recognize that monopolistic competition was not the exception but the rule. In the mid-twentieth century, the Big Three or Four were the behemoths of the oil and car industries – Standard Oil, or Ford and General Motors. Today the monopolists are more likely to be drawn from the ranks of tech giants such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon or Google.\n\n\nTheory of Games illustrates why, without tough anti-trust laws and incessant vigilance, monopolies and oligopolies spring up like weeds. In a market dominated by one or a few big firms, each would naturally use its heft to maximize profits. Even with no active collusion, they push up prices for consumers as if they had formed one of von Neumann and Morgenstern’s coalitions.\n\n\nDespite the many plaudits, game theory did not immediately catch on with economists. The book was too mathematical. Even at Princeton, where the mathematics department quickly became a hotbed for research on the subject, the economics department was hostile.\n\n\nOstrom described how locals invented ways to protect such resources. In Nepal, for instance, she found that cattle belonging to farmers who had failed to follow rules for water usage were interned in a ‘cow jail’ until a fine was paid to secure their release.\n\n\nOthers took Hamilton’s work forward, including George Price, a chemist who worked on the Manhattan Project before moving to Britain and making some decisive contributions to evolutionary theory. First, Price wrote an equation that extended Hamilton’s ideas to include all evolutionary change – not just traits that benefit family members. This elegant mathematical interpretation of natural selection is now known as the Price Equation.\n\n\nHamilton would, among other contributions to the field, produce a mathematical model of altruism based on the degree of relatedness (kinship) between different organisms. He showed that genes for self-sacrificing behaviours would spread as long as they benefited blood relatives (who were also likely to carry the same genes\n\n\nPrice became so appalled by the idea that altruistic behaviour could be adequately explained by selfishness, rather than by the existence of some nobler motivation, that he took to performing random acts of kindness in a bid to convince himself he was mistaken. He ultimately became so depressed that, in 1975, he ended his own life by slitting his carotid artery with a pair of nail scissors.\n\n\nThe Soviet newspaper Pravda once branded the organization based at the pink and white stucco building the ‘American academy for death and destruction’.\n\n\nRAND for ‘Research ANd Development’.\n\n\nThere was even resistance to the idea of ordering blackboards and chalk (which the academics wanted in four different colours).\n\n\nThe game, later named ‘So Long, Sucker’, was designed to push people to their psychological limit: some married couples reputedly went home in separate cabs after a night of play.\n\n\nNash nervously started to present what would turn out to be his greatest – and final – contribution to game theory. He had come up with a mathematical framework allowing the analysis of any type of game – whether zero-sum or not – with any number of participants, and showed that there are certain outcomes for all games in which no player can do any better by unilaterally changing their strategy. These kinds of solutions to a game are now called Nash equilibria. It was a staggering accomplishment, though no one, least of all Nash, had any idea how thoroughly useful his idea would prove to be. There was one catch: in Nash’s scheme, players were not allowed to communicate or team up – almost as if they were caught in a perpetual final round of ‘Fuck your buddy!’ Von Neumann hated it.\n\n\n‘His hatred, his loathing for the Nazis was essentially boundless,’ says Klári. ‘They came and destroyed the world of this perfect intellectual setting. In quick order they dispersed the concentration of minds and substituted concentration camps where many of those who were not quick enough … perished in the most horrible ways.’\n\n\nIronically, just as von Neumann was abandoning the doctrine of preventive war, it effectively became US policy.\n\n\nThe four-week hearing had begun on 12 April 1954. Oppenheimer’s security clearance was stripped on 29 June. In 2009, historians with access to the KGB archives found that Soviet intelligence had made many attempts to recruit Oppenheimer – but failed\n\n\nLeMay’s preferred nuclear strategy, the ‘Sunday Punch’, was ‘Massive Retaliation’ by another name: a no-holds-barred attack on the Soviet Union with every atom bomb at SAC’s disposal in response to any aggression. If there was, as RAND now claimed, a risk of a Soviet surprise attack then, why, that was sufficient reason to hit them first. It was not so much a war plan, Kahn told SAC officers, as a ‘war orgasm’.\n\n\nThree hundred years earlier, when the philosopher René Descartes declared ‘the body to be nothing but a machine’ his student, the twenty-three-year-old Queen Christina of Sweden, is said to have challenged him: ‘I never saw my clock making babies’.\n\n\nOr, as Freeman Dyson put it, ‘So far as we know, the basic design of every microorganism larger than a virus is precisely as von Neumann said it should be.’\n\n\n‘Floccinaucinihilipilification’, meaning ‘the habit of regarding something as worthless’, was Conway’s favourite word\n\n\nI heard about one mathematician who worked for a large corporation. He had a button concealed under his desk. If he was exploring Life, and someone from management entered the room, he would press the button and the machine would go back to working on some problem related to the company!\n\n\nThe 1,-page tome starts with characteristic modesty. ‘Three centuries ago science was transformed by the dramatic new idea that rules based on mathematical equations could be used to describe the natural world,’ he declares. ‘My purpose in this book is to initiate another such transformation.’\n\n\n‘There’s a tradition of scientists approaching senility to come up with grand, improbable theories,’ Freeman Dyson told Newsweek after the book’s release. ‘Wolfram is unusual in that he’s doing this in his 40s.’\n\n\n‘If people do not believe that mathematics is simple,’ von Neumann once said, ‘it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.’\n\n\nSchelling had produced two powerful conclusions with a fairly elementary model. First, cities can become segregated along lines of race even if no one minds living in a mixed community. Second, only an active desire for diversity leads to diverse neighbourhoods. Indifference results in segregation.\n\n\nBrains don’t look so impressive. A neuron can fire perhaps 100 times a second, while the best computers at the time were already able to carry out a million or more operations a second – and a modern laptop is at least a thousand times faster than this. Worse, neurons were billions of times less accurate than computer components: every time a signal is transmitted from one neuron to another, there is a risk that errors are exacerbated.\n\n\n‘Von Neumann, when I was there at Princeton, was under extreme pressure,’ says Benoît Mandelbrot, who had come to the IAS in 1953 at von Neumann’s invitation, ‘from mathematicians, who were despising him for no longer being a mathematician; by the physicists, who were despising him for never having been a real physicist; and by everybody for having brought to Princeton this collection of low-class individuals called “programmers”’. ‘Von Neumann,’ Mandelbrot continues, ‘was simply being shunned. And he was not a man to take it.’\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Things/Chip-War":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Things/Chip-War","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Things/Chip War.md","title":"Chip War","links":[],"tags":["books","computers","chips","technology","non-fiction","political-science","geopolitics"],"content":"Chip War\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the history of semiconductor production. It goes through the pioneers, the innovators, and the giants of the industry. It also goes through the political factors that govern the semiconductor industry.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was quite an interesting read and gives a good overview and deep dive into the history of semiconductors and discusses how the business and political spectrum collide. It also delves into the innovators and pioneers in the industry, their backgrounds, and what made their companies successful. It also goes into the challenges presented by the companies and how small the margins of errors are.\nI got more insight into how the companies that have seamless technology, such as Tesla and Apple, often have custom-designed chips. It also made me aware of how the industry works, the designers of chips, the manufacturers of chips and the suppliers of manufacturing tools.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nChina now spends more money each year importing chips than it spends on oil.\n\n\nArmchair strategists theorize about China’s “Malacca Dilemma”—a reference to the main shipping channel between the Pacific and Indian Oceans—and the country’s ability to access supplies of oil and other commodities amid a crisis. Beijing, however, is more worried about a blockade measured in bytes rather than barrels\n\n\nToday, no firm fabricates chips with more precision than the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC.\n\n\nApple sold over 100 million iPhone 12s, each powered by an A processor chip with 11 billion tiny transistors carved into its silicon. In a matter of months, in other words, for just one of the dozen chips in an iPhone, TSMC’s Fab 18 fabricated well over 1 quintillion transistors—\n\n\nIn 1970, the second company Moore founded, Intel, unveiled a memory chip that could remember 1, pieces of information (“bits”). It cost around , roughly two cents per bit. Today,  can buy a thumb drive that can remember well over a billion bits.\n\n\nChips from Taiwan provide 37 percent of the world’s new computing power each year. Two Korean companies produce 44 percent of the world’s memory chips. The Dutch company ASML builds 100 percent of the world’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, without which cutting-edge chips are simply impossible to make. OPEC’s 40 percent share of world oil production looks unimpressive by comparison.\n\n\nJapanese soldiers described World War II as a “typhoon of steel.”\n\n\nThe United States built more tanks than all the Axis powers combined, more ships, more planes, and twice the Axis production of artillery and machine guns.\n\n\nThe war was waged by soldiers at Stalingrad and sailors at Midway. But the fighting power was produced by America’s Kaiser shipyards and the assembly lines at River Rouge.\n\n\nOutside of Tokyo, Akio Morita, the young engineer, donned his full uniform to hear Emperor Hirohito’s surrender address, though he listened to the speech alone rather than in the company of other naval officers, so he wouldn’t be pressured to commit ritual suicide.\n\n\nAbout a year earlier, in Palo Alto, California, a group of eight engineers employed by William Shockley’s semiconductor lab had told their Nobel Prize−winning boss that they were quitting. Shockley had a knack for spotting talent, but he was an awful manager. He thrived on controversy and created a toxic atmosphere that alienated the bright young engineers he’d assembled. So these eight engineers left Shockley Semiconductor and decided to found their own company, Fairchild Semiconductor, with seed funding from an East Coast millionaire.\n\n\nMost important was Bob Noyce, the leader of the “traitorous eight,” who had a charismatic, visionary enthusiasm for microelectronics and an intuitive sense of which technical advances were needed to make transistors tiny, cheap, and reliable.\n\n\nMIT considered the Apollo guidance computer one of its proudest accomplishments, but Bob Noyce knew that it was his chips that made the Apollo computer tick.\n\n\nWhile looking through a microscope at one of their transistors, Lathrop and his assistant, chemist James Nall, had an idea: a microscope lens could take something small and make it look bigger. If they turned the microscope upside down, its lens would take something big and make it look smaller. Could they use a lens to take a big pattern and “print” it onto germanium, thereby making miniature mesas on their blocks of germanium? Kodak, the camera company, sold chemicals called photoresists, which reacted when exposed to light. Lathrop covered a block of germanium with one of Kodak’s photoresist chemicals that would disappear if exposed to light. Next, he turned his microscope upside down, covering the lens with a pattern so that light would only pass through a rectangle-shaped area. Light entered the pattern, shined in a rectangle shape through the lens, and was shrunk in size by the upside-down microscope as it focused onto the photoresist-coated germanium, with the rays of light creating a perfectly shaped, miniature version of the rectangular pattern. Where light struck the layer of photoresist, the chemical structure was altered, allowing it to be washed away, leaving a tiny rectangular hole, far smaller and more accurately shaped than any glob of wax could have been. Soon Lathrop discovered he could print “wires,” too, by adding an ultra-thin layer of aluminum to connect the germanium with an external power source. Lathrop called the process photolithography—printing with light.\n\n\nA master bridge player, Chang approached manufacturing as methodically as he played his favorite card game. Upon arriving at TI, he began systematically tweaking the temperature and pressure at which different chemicals were combined, to determine which combinations worked best, applying his intuition to the data in a way that amazed and intimidated his colleagues. “You had to be careful when you worked with him,” remembered one colleague. “He sat there and puffed on his pipe and looked at you through the smoke.”\n\n\nAs one of Fairchild’s employees put it in the exit questionnaire he filled out when leaving the company: “I… WANT… TO… GET… RICH.”\n\n\nAfter one class, Trutko asked the Nobel Prize winner to sign a copy of his magnum opus Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors. “To Anatole,” Shockley signed, before barking at the young scientist with complaints that the Soviet Union refused to pay royalties for the textbook’s Russian translation.\n\n\nCIA report in 1959 found that America was only two to four years ahead of the Soviets in quality and quantity of transistors produced. At least several of the early Soviet exchange students were KGB agents—suspected at the time, but not confirmed until decades later—forging an intimate connection between student exchanges and Soviet defense industrial goals.\n\n\nThe recipe for chips was already extraordinarily complicated. Foreign exchange students studying with Shockley at Stanford could become smart physicists, but it was engineers like Andy Grove or Mary Anne Potter who knew at what temperature certain chemicals needed to be heated, or how long photoresists should be exposed to light. Every step of the process of making chips involved specialized knowledge that was rarely shared outside of a specific company.\n\n\nSoviet leaders never comprehended how the “copy it” strategy condemned them to backwardness. The entire Soviet semiconductor sector functioned like a defense contractor—secretive, top-down, oriented toward military systems, fulfilling orders with little scope for creativity.\n\n\nDe Gaulle was formalistic and ceremonious, a tradition-minded military man who saw himself as the incarnation of French grandeur. Ikeda, by contrast, thought his country’s voters were straightforwardly materialistic, and promised to double their incomes within a decade.\n\n\nMorita’s physics degree proved useful in postwar Japan, too. In April 1946, with the country still in ruins, Morita partnered with a former colleague named Masaru Ibuka to build an electronics business, which they soon named Sony, from the Latin sonus (sound) and the American nickname “sonny.” Their first device, an electric rice cooker, was a dud, but their tape recorder worked well and sold better.\n\n\nJapan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry also wanted to support electronics firms, but the ministry’s impact was mixed, with bureaucrats at one point delaying Sony’s application to license the transistor from Bell Labs by several months on the grounds that it was “inexcusably outrageous” for the company to have signed a contract with a foreign firm without the ministry’s consent.\n\n\n“Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them what kind of products they want,” Morita declared. “The public does not know what is possible, but we do.”\n\n\nSony’s expertise wasn’t in designing chips but devising consumer products and customizing the electronics they needed. Calculators were another consumer device transformed by Japanese firms. Pat Haggerty, the TI Chairman, had asked Jack Kilby to build a handheld, semiconductor-powered calculator in 1967. However, TI’s marketing department didn’t think there’d be a market for a cheap, handheld calculator, so the project stagnated.\n\n\n“A people with their history won’t be content to make transistor radios,” President Richard Nixon later observed.\n\n\nSony’s Morita, who happened to be a friend of Haggerty, offered to help in exchange for a share of the profits. He told TI executives to visit Tokyo incognito, register at their hotel under false names, and never leave their hotel room. Morita visited the hotel clandestinely and proposed a joint venture: TI would produce chips in Japan, and Sony would manage the bureaucrats. “We will cover for you,” he told the Texas Instruments executives. The Texans thought Sony was a “rogue operation,” something they meant as a compliment.\n\n\nSporck had studied engineering at Cornell before being hired by GE in the mid-s at the firm’s factory in Hudson Falls, New York. He was tasked with improving GE’s process for manufacturing capacitors and proposed changing the factory’s assembly line process. He believed his new technique would improve productivity, but the labor union that controlled GE’s assembly line workers saw him as threatening their control over the production process. The union revolted, staging a rally against Sporck and burning him in effigy.\n\n\nThe two Fairchild employees who interviewed him were drunk after a boozy lunch and offered him a job on the spot. It was one of the best hiring decisions Fairchild made.\n\n\nHong Kong. The city’s 25-cent hourly wages were only a tenth of American wages but were among the highest in Asia. In the mid-s, Taiwanese workers made 19 cents an hour, Malaysians 15 cents, Singaporeans 11 cents, and South Koreans only a dime.\n\n\nA postwar study found that only 9. percent of Sparrows fired in Vietnam hit their target, while 66 percent malfunctioned, and the rest simply missed.\n\n\nForeign policy strategists perceived ethnic Chinese communities all over the region as ripe for Communist penetration, ready to fall to Communist influence like a cascade of dominoes. Malaysia’s ethnic Chinese minority formed the backbone of that country’s Communist Party, for example. Singapore’s restive working class was majority ethnic Chinese\n\n\nBy the early 1980s, the electronics industry accounted for 7 percent of Singapore’s GNP and a quarter of its manufacturing jobs. Of electronics production, 60 percent was semiconductor devices, and much of the rest was goods that couldn’t work without\n\n\nNoyce and Moore abandoned Fairchild as quickly as they’d left Shockley’s startup a decade earlier, and founded Intel, which stood for Integrated Electronics.\n\n\nCoupling a tiny transistor with a capacitor, a miniature storage device that is either charged or not. Capacitors leak over time, so Dennard envisioned repeatedly charging the capacitor via the transistor. The chip would be called a dynamic (due to the repeated charging) random access memory, or DRAM. These chips form the core of computer memory up to the present day.\n\n\nIntel planned to dominate the business of DRAM chips. Memory chips don’t need to be specialized, so chips with the same design can be used in many different types of devices.\n\n\nAt his parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary party in 1972, Bob Noyce interrupted the festivities, held up a silicon wafer, and declared to his family: “This is going to change the world.”\n\n\n“In the past 200 years we have improved our ability to manufacture goods and move people by a factor of 100,” Mead calculated. “But in the last 20 years there has been an increase of 1 to 10 in the rate at which we process and retrieve information.” A revolutionary explosion of data processing was coming. “We have computer power coming out of our ears.”\n\n\n“We are really the revolutionaries in the world today,” Gordon Moore declared in 1973, “not the kids with the long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago.”\n\n\nExponential increases, which Moore’s Law dictated, are rarely seen and hard to comprehend.\n\n\nThey joked that Japan was the country of “click, click”—the sound made by cameras that Japanese engineers brought to chip conferences to better copy the ideas. The fact that major American chipmakers were embroiled in intellectual property lawsuits with Japanese rivals was interpreted as evidence that Silicon Valley was still well ahead.\n\n\nAcademics devised elaborate theories to explain how Japan’s huge conglomerates were better at manufacturing than America’s small startups. But the mundane reality was that GCA didn’t listen to its customers, while Nikon did. Chip firms that interacted with GCA found it “arrogant” and “not responsive.” No one said that about its Japanese rivals.\n\n\nGreenberg himself aimed criticism at the company’s employees. “He would use unbelievable four-letter words,” one subordinate remembered. Another recalled a decision to ban high-heeled shoes, which Greenberg thought ruined the company’s carpets. As tension grew, the receptionist developed a code with fellow employees, turning on a ceiling light to denote that Greenberg was in the building, and turning it off when he left. Everyone could breathe a bit easier when he was out.\n\n\n“Potato chips, computer chips, what’s the difference?” one Reagan Administration economist was widely quoted as saying. “They’re all chips.\n\n\nTrade negotiators compared negotiating with the Japanese to peeling an onion. “The whole thing is a rather zen experience,” one U.S. trade negotiator reported, with discussions ending with philosophical questions like “what is an onion, anyway.”\n\n\nChipmakers needed better manufacturing equipment, while the firms that produced this equipment needed to know what chipmakers were looking for. CEOs of equipment firms complained that “companies like TI, Motorola, and IBM… just would not open up about their technology.” Without an understanding of what technology these companies were working on, it was impossible to sell to them. Chipmakers, meanwhile, grumbled about the reliability of the machines they depended on. In the late 1980s, Intel’s equipment was running only 30 percent of the time due to maintenance and repairs, one employee estimated.\n\n\n“The United States has been busy creating lawyers,” Morita lectured, while Japan has “been busier creating engineers.”\n\n\n“Serving the nation through business,” the first part of the Lee family motto read.\n\n\nIf HP could grow from a Palo Alto garage to a tech behemoth, surely a fish-and-vegetables shop like Samsung could, too.\n\n\nConway was a brilliant computer scientist, but anyone who spoke with her discovered a mind that glistened with insights from diverse fields, astronomy to anthropology to historical philosophy. She had arrived at Xerox in 1973 in “stealth mode,” she explained, following being fired from IBM in 1968 after undergoing a gender transition. She was shocked to find that the Valley’s chipmakers were more like artists than engineers. High-tech tools were paired with simple tweezers.\n\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, a chip with a million transistors—unthinkable in the early 1970s, when Lynn Conway had arrived in Silicon Valley—had become a reality, when Intel announced its 486 microprocessor, a small piece of silicon packed with 1. million microscopic switches.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, the KGB reportedly employed around one thousand people to steal foreign technology. Around three hundred worked at foreign posts, with most of the rest on the eighth floor of the KGB’s imposing headquarters on Moscow’s Lubyanka Square, sitting atop the Stalin-era prison and torture chambers.\n\n\nThe Soviet consulate in San Francisco reportedly had a team of sixty agents targeting the tech firms of Silicon Valley. They stole chips directly and bought them from the black market, supplied by thieves like the man called “One Eyed Jack,” who was caught in California in 1982 and accused of stealing chips from an Intel facility by hiding them in his leather jacket.\n\n\nThe KGB thought its campaign of theft provided Soviet semiconductor producers with extraordinary secrets, but getting a copy of a new chip didn’t guarantee Soviet engineers could produce it. The KGB began stealing semiconductor manufacturing equipment, too. The CIA claimed that the USSR had acquired nearly every facet of the semiconductor manufacturing process, including nine hundred Western machines for preparing materials needed for semiconductor fabrication; eight hundred machines for lithography and etching; and three hundred machines each for doping, packaging, and testing chips. However, a factory needed a full suite of equipment, and when machines broke down, they needed spare parts. Sometimes spare parts for foreign machines could be produced in the USSR, but this introduced new inefficiencies and defects\n\n\nWestern spies were shocked at just how much the Soviets stole.\n\n\nThe French quickly shared information about Vetrov with U.S. and other allied intelligence services. The Reagan administration responded by launching Operation Exodus, which tightened customs checks on advanced technology. By 1985, the program had seized around $ million worth of goods and resulted in around one thousand arrests.\n\n\nThe USSR’s “copy it” strategy had actually benefitted the United States, guaranteeing the Soviets faced a continued technological lag. In 1985, the CIA conducted a study of Soviet microprocessors and found that the USSR produced replicas of Intel and Motorola chips like clockwork. They were always half a decade behind.\n\n\nOne popular Soviet joke from the 1980s recounted a Kremlin official who declared proudly, “Comrade, we have built the world’s biggest microprocessor!”\n\n\nThe most pessimistic Soviet estimates suggested that if the U.S. launched a nuclear first strike in the 1980s, it could have disabled or destroyed 98 percent of Soviet ICBMs.\n\n\nOne issue was political meddling. In the late 1980s, Yuri Osokin was removed from his job at the Riga semiconductor plant. The KGB had demanded that he fire several of his employees, one of whom had mailed letters to a woman in Czechoslovakia, a second who refused to work as an informant for the KGB, and a third who was a Jew. When Osokin refused to punish these workers for their “crimes,” the KGB ousted him and tried to have his wife fired, too. It was hard enough to design chips in normal times. Doing so while battling the KGB was impossible.\n\n\nA crucial ingredient in TSMC’s early success was deep ties with the U.S. chip industry. Most of its customers were U.S. chip designers, and many top employees had worked in Silicon Valley.\n\n\nWere it not for Communist rule, China might have played a much larger role in the semiconductor industry. When the integrated circuit was invented, China had many of the ingredients that helped Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea attract American semiconductor investment, like a vast, low-cost workforce and a well-educated scientific elite. However, after seizing power in 1949, the Communists looked at foreign connections with suspicion. For someone like Morris Chang, returning to China after finishing his studies at Stanford would have meant certain poverty and possible imprisonment or death.\n\n\nChairman Mao’s “Brilliant Directive issued on July 21, 1968” insisted that “it is essential to shorten the length of schooling, revolutionize education, put proletarian politics in command…. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, and they should return to production after a few years study.” The idea of building advanced industries with poorly educated employees was absurd. Even more so was Mao’s effort to keep out foreign technology and ideas\n\n\nMost of China’s scientists resented the chairman for ruining their research—and their lives—by sending them to live on peasant farms to study proletarian politics rather than semiconductor engineering.\n\n\nBut still, much of the Maoist legacy remained. The Americans were told that Chinese scientists didn’t publish their research because they opposed “self-glorification.”\n\n\nThe example of Shockley—a brilliant scientist but a failed businessman—demonstrated that the link between capitalism and self-glorification wasn’t as straightforward as Maoist doctrine suggested.\n\n\nThe company even had a slogan, “one old staffer brings along two new ones,” emphasizing the need for experienced foreign-trained employees to help local engineers learn.\n\n\nIn 1984, Philips, the Dutch electronics firm, had spun out its internal lithography division, creating ASML.\n\n\nThe only real competitor to Canon and Nikon was ASML, the small but growing Dutch lithography company. In 1984, Philips, the Dutch electronics firm, had spun out its internal lithography division, creating ASML.\n\n\nIn the years since Intel first adopted the x architecture, computer scientists at Berkeley had devised a newer, simpler chip architecture called RISC that offered more efficient calculations and thus lower power consumption. The x architecture was complex and bulky by comparison. In the 1990s, Andy Grove had seriously considered switching Intel’s main chips to a RISC architecture, but ultimately decided against it. RISC was more efficient, but the cost of change was high, and the threat to Intel’s de facto monopoly was too serious. The computer industry was designed around x and Intel dominated the ecosystem. So x defines most PC architectures to this day.\n\n\nIn 1990, Apple and two partners established a joint venture called Arm, based in Cambridge, England. The aim was to design processor chips using a new instruction set architecture based on the simpler RISC principles that Intel had considered but rejected. As a startup, Arm faced no costs of shifting away from x, because it had no business and no customers. Instead, it wanted to replace x at the center of the computing ecosystem. Arm’s first CEO, Robin Saxby, had vast ambitions for the twelve-person startup. “We have got to be the global standard,” he told his colleagues. “That’s the only chance we’ve got.”\n\n\nOtellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 to 2013, admitted he turned down the contract to build iPhone chips because he worried about the financial implications. A fixation on profit margins seeped deep into the firm—its hiring decisions, its product road maps, and its R&amp;D processes.\n\n\nWhen he heard a quip from a journalist in the 1990s that “real men have fabs,” he adopted the phrase as his own. “Now hear me and hear me well,” Sanders declared at one industry conference. “Real men have fabs.”\n\n\nIn the 1990s, when Microsoft Office introduced an animated, paperclip called Clippy that sat at the side of the screen and dispensed advice, it represented a leap forward in graphics—and often caused computers to freeze.\n\n\nNvidia released CUDA, software that lets GPUs be programmed in a standard programming language, without any reference to graphics at all. Even as Nvidia was churning out top-notch graphics chips, Huang spent lavishly on this software effort, at least $ billion, according to a company estimate in 2017, to let any programmer—not just graphics experts—work with Nvidia’s chips.\n\n\nFor each generation of cell phone technology after 2G, Qualcomm contributed key ideas about how to transmit more data via the radio spectrum and sold specialized chips with the computing power capable of deciphering this cacophony of signals. The company’s patents are so fundamental it’s impossible to make a cell phone without them.\n\n\nChang realized that TSMC could pull ahead of rivals technologically because it was a neutral player around which other companies would design their products. He called this TSMC’s “Grand Alliance,” a partnership of dozens of companies that design chips, sell intellectual property, produce materials, or manufacture machinery. Many of these companies compete with each other, but since none fabricate wafers, none compete with TSMC. TSMC could therefore coordinate between them, setting standards that most other companies in the chip industry would agree to use.\n\n\nThis investment in specialized silicon explains why Apple’s products work so smoothly.\n\n\nSo the text etched onto the back of each iPhone—“Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China”—is highly misleading. The iPhone’s most irreplaceable components are indeed designed in California and assembled in China. But they can only be made in Taiwan.\n\n\nHe then joined TSMC in the late 1990s just as deep-ultraviolet lithography tools, which produced light with a wavelength of 193 nanometers, were coming online. For nearly two decades, the industry relied on these tools to fabricate ever-smaller transistors, using a series of optical tricks like shooting light through water or through multiple masks to enable light waves measuring 193nm to pattern shapes a fraction of the size. These tricks kept Moore’s Law alive, as the chip industry shrank transistors from the 180nm node in the late 1990s through the early stages of 3D FinFET chips, which were ready for high-volume manufacturing by the mid-s.\n\n\n“People worked so much harder in Taiwan,” Chiang explained. Because manufacturing tools account for much of the cost of an advanced fab, keeping the equipment operating is crucial for profitability. In the U.S., Chiang said, if something broke at 1 a.m., the engineer would fix it the next morning. At TSMC, they’d fix it by 2 a.m. “They do not complain,” he explained, and “their spouse does not complain” either.\n\n\n“When a Chinese firm said, ‘Let’s open a joint venture,’ ” one European semiconductor executive explained. “I heard, ‘Let’s lose money.’ ” The joint ventures that did emerge were generally addicted to government subsidies and rarely produced meaningful new technology.\n\n\nChina spends more money buying chips each year than the entire global trade in aircraft. No product is more central to international trade than semiconductors.\n\n\nIntegrated circuits made up 15 percent of South Korea’s exports in 2017; 17 percent of Singapore’s; 19 percent of Malaysia’s; 21 percent of the Philippines’; and 36 percent of Taiwan’s.\n\n\nLee built Samsung from a trader of dried fish into a tech company churning out some of the world’s most advanced processor and memory chips by relying on three strategies. First, assiduously cultivate political relationships to garner favorable regulation and cheap capital. Second, identify products pioneered in the West and Japan and learn to build them at equivalent quality and lower cost. Third, globalize relentlessly, not only to seek new customers but also to learn by competing with the world’s best companies. Executing these strategies made Samsung one of the world’s biggest companies, achieving revenues equivalent to 10 percent of South Korea’s entire GDP.\n\n\nAmerica’s technological lead in fabrication, lithography, and other fields had dissipated because Washington convinced itself that companies should compete but that governments should simply provide a level playing field. A laissez-faire system works if every country agrees to it. Many governments, especially in Asia, were deeply involved in supporting their chip industries.\n\n\nThen, after joining an advisory council convened by the White House, Krzanich later resigned from it. Even when industry executives overlooked Trump’s domestic policies, his volatility made him a problematic ally. Announcing tariffs via tweet was never a tactic that would impress CEOs.\n\n\nThe China hawks on the NSC were determined to change this dynamic. They saw the Micron case as the type of unfair trade that Trump had promised to fix, even though the president himself displayed no particular interest in Micron\n\n\n“Weaponized interdependence,” one former senior official mused after the strike on Huawei. “It’s a beautiful thing.”\n\n\nAccording to a Chinese media report that’s since been removed from the internet, HSMC was founded by a group of scam artists who carried fake business cards that read “TSMC—Vice President” and spread rumors that their relatives were top Communist Party officials. They duped the Wuhan local government into investing in their company, then used the funds to hire as CEO TSMC’s former head of R&amp;D. With him on board, they acquired a deep-ultraviolet lithography machine from ASML, then used this feat to raise more funds from investors.\n\n\nOne of China’s core challenges today is that many chips use either the x architecture (for PCs and servers) or the Arm architecture (for mobile devices); x is dominated by two U.S. firms, Intel and AMD, while Arm, which licenses other companies to use its architecture, is based in the UK. However, there’s now a new instruction set architecture called RISC-V that is open-sourced, so it’s available to anyone without a fee. The idea of an open-source architecture appeals to many parts of the chip industry. Anyone who currently must pay Arm for a license would prefer a free alternative. Moreover, the risk of security defects may be lower, because the open nature of an open-source architecture like RISC-V means that more engineers will be able to verify details and identify errors. For the same reason, the pace of innovation may be faster, too.\n\n\nAccording to the American Automotive Policy Council, an industry group, the world’s biggest auto companies can use over a thousand chips in each car.\n\n\nThese firms are estimated to have produced 7. million fewer cars in 2021 than would have been possible had they not faced chip shortages, which implies a $ billion collective revenue loss, according to industry estimates.\n\n\nBut the world produced more chips in 2021 than ever before—over 1. trillion semiconductor devices, according to research firm IC Insights. This was a 13 percent increase compared to 2020.\n\n\nSome back-of-the-envelope calculations illustrate what’s at stake. Taiwan produces 11 percent of the world’s memory chips. More important, it fabricates 37 percent of the world’s logic chips. Computers, phones, data centers, and most other electronic devices simply can’t work without them, so if Taiwan’s fabs were knocked offline, we’d produce 37 percent less computing power during the following year.\n\n\nLosing 37 percent of our production of computing power each year could well be more costly than the COVID pandemic and its economically disastrous lockdowns. It would take at least half a decade to rebuild the lost chipmaking capacity.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has received huge stockpiles of guided munitions from the West, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles that rely on over 200 semiconductors each as they home in on enemy tanks.\n\n\nTransistors today cost far less than a millionth of their 1958 price thanks to the spirit expressed by the now-forgotten Fairchild employee who wrote on his exit survey when leaving the company: “I… WANT… TO… GET… RICH.”\n\n\n“We’re not running out of atoms,” Keller has said. “We know how to print single layers of atoms.”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Things/Moneyball":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Things/Moneyball","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Things/Moneyball.md","title":"Moneyball","links":[],"tags":["mathematics","economics","statistics","optimimization","sports"],"content":"Moneyball\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nHow statistics revolutionized baseball.

People always thought their own experience was typical when it wasn’t. There was also a tendency to be overly influenced by a guy’s most recent performance: what he did last was not necessarily what he would do next. Thirdly—but not lastly—there was the bias toward what people saw with their own eyes, or thought they had seen.\n\n\nSome of the scouts still believed they could tell by the structure of a young man’s face not only his character but his future in pro ball. They had a phrase they used: “the Good Face.” Billy had the Good Face.\n\n\nRoger Jongewaard, the Mets’ head scout, says, “You have to understand: we don’t just look at performance. We were looking at talent.”\n\n\n“And Billy was a premium premium guy. He had the size, the speed, the arm, the whole package. He could play other sports. He was a true athlete. And then, on top of all that, he had good grades in school and he was going with all the prettiest girls. He had charm. He could have been anything.”\n\n\nTo the chagrin of Billy’s mother, who was intent on her son going to Stanford, Jongewaard planted himself in the Beane household. That didn’t work either. “I wasn’t getting the vibes I would like,” Jongewaard now says. “And so I took Billy to see the big club.”\n\n\nThe Padres told Zito that he didn’t throw hard enough to make it in the big leagues. The Oakland A’s disagreed and selected him with the ninth pick of the 1999 draft. Three years later a top executive for those same San Diego Padres would say that the reason the Oakland A’s win so many games with so little money is that “Billy got lucky with those pitchers.”\n\n\nIt turned out that Scott Hatteberg had been on the Oakland A’s wish list for several years. He’d never done anything flashy or sensational. He didn’t hit an attention-getting number of home runs. He had never hit much over or under .270. He had the same dull virtues as David Justice and Jeremy Giambi: plate discipline and an ability to get on base. He, like them, was a blackjack dealer who understood never to hit on 19. The rest of baseball viewed Hatteberg as a catcher who could hit some, rather than as an efficient device for creating runs who could also catch.\n\n\nIn any case, you had only to study the history of the draft to see that high school pitchers were twice less likely than college pitchers, and four times less likely than college position players, to make it to the big leagues. Taking a high school pitcher in the first round—and spending 1.2 million bucks to sign him—was exactly the sort of thing that happened when you let scouts have their way. It defied the odds; it defied reason. Reason, even science, was what Billy Beane was intent on bringing to baseball.\n\n\nUp till then, Grady had every reason to feel secure in his job. Other teams, when they sought to explain to themselves why the Oakland A’s had won so many games with so little money, and excuse themselves for winning so few with so much, usually invoked the A’s scouting. Certainly, Grady could never have imagined that his scouting department was on the brink of total overhaul, and that his job was on the line.\n\n\n“The biggest thing that AVM does is extract the element of luck. Everyone in baseball knows how much luck is involved in the game but they all say, ‘The luck evens out.’ What AVM was saying is that it doesn’t. It’s not good enough to say, ‘Aw, it just evens out.’”\n\n\nPaul had said the scouts ought to go have a look at a college kid named Kevin Youkilis. Youkilis was a fat third baseman who couldn’t run, throw, or field. What was the point of going to see that? (Because, Paul would be able to say three months later, Kevin Youkilis has the second highest on-base percentage in all of professional baseball, after Barry Bonds. To Paul, he’d become Euclis: the Greek god of walks.)\n\n\nHe was left wondering. Months passed without any word of Beck from the scouting department. Paul finally asked Grady about him. And Grady said, “Oh yeah, I forgot, I’ll have one of the scouts go have a look.” But he didn’t do it, at least not seriously. When Paul asked again, Billy Owens, the A’s scout responsible for covering Tennessee grudgingly came back to him with the word that Beck was “a soft tosser.” Soft tosser was scouting code for not worth my time. Paul still had the impression that no one had bothered to scout David Beck.\n\n\n“He’s a tools guy,” says the old scout, defensively. The old scouts aren’t built to argue; they are built to agree. They are part of a tightly woven class of former baseball players. The scout looks left and right for support. It doesn’t arrive.\n\n\nMore silence. Decades of scouting experience are being rendered meaningless. “I hate to piss on the campfire,” one of the scouts finally says, “but I haven’t heard Teahen’s name once all year. I haven’t heard other teams talking about him. I haven’t heard his name around here all year. It wasn’t like this guy was a fifty-five we all liked.”\n\n\nIt’s what he doesn’t say that is interesting. No one in big league baseball cares how often a college players walks; Paul cares about it more than just about anything else. He doesn’t explain why walks are important. He doesn’t explain that he has gone back and studied which amateur hitters made it to the big leagues, and which did not, and why. He doesn’t explain that the important traits in a baseball player were not all equally important. That foot speed, fielding ability, even raw power tended to be dramatically overpriced. That the ability to control the strike zone was the greatest indicator of future success. That the number of walks a hitter drew was the best indicator of whether he understood how to control the strike zone.\n\n\nBilly had his own idea about where to find future major league baseball players: inside Paul’s computer. He’d flirted with the idea of firing all the scouts and just drafting the kids straight from Paul’s laptop. The Internet now served up just about every statistic you could want about every college player in the country, and Paul knew them\n\n\n“Come on,” says Erik, “you guys have all played with guys who were bad bodies and good baseball players.” “Yeah,” says Billy. “I played with Pitter.” Everyone laughs, even Pitter. “Another thing about Brown,” says Billy; “he walks his ass off.” “He’s leading the country in walks,” says Paul. Walks! “He better walk because he can’t run,” says one of the scouts. “That body, Billy,” says the most vocal old scout. “It’s not natural.” He’s pleading now. “He’s got big thighs,” says the fat scout, thoughtfully munching another jumbo-sized chocolate chip cookie. “A big butt. He’s huge in the ass.” “Every year that body has just gotten worse and worse and worse,” says a third.\n\n\nBaseball people express their fondness for a thing by thinking up lots of different ways to say it.\n\n\nAll these attempts to manipulate his psyche he regarded as so much crap. “Sports psychologists are a crutch,” he said. “An excuse for why you are not doing it rather than a solution. If somebody needs them, there is a weakness in them that will prevent them from succeeding. It’s not a character flaw; it’s just a character flaw when it comes to baseball.”\n\n\n“Pretty girls tend to become insufferable because, being pretty, their faults are too much tolerated. Possessions entrap men, and wealth paralyzes them. I learned to write because I am one of those people who somehow cannot manage the common communications of smiles and gestures, but must use words to get across things that other people would never need to say.”\n\n\nWord had spread this time: 250 people bought a copy. To an author who viewed a sale of 75 copies as encouragement, the sale of 250 was a bonanza. James’s pen was now an unstoppable force.\n\n\nWhen his fastball registers 82 miles per hour on the radar gun, he’s having a good day. “I’ve faced guys who threw harder in high school,” says Hatteberg. “This guy wouldn’t get drafted. He could go out and try out for a team right now and if they didn’t know who he was he wouldn’t get signed.” That one of the best pitchers in the big leagues couldn’t get beyond a tryout tells you something about the big leagues. It also tells you something about pitchers.\n\n\nFeiny was putting his college degree in medieval European history to work preparing videotapes for the Oakland A’s.\n\n\n“Baseball is a war of attrition,” Billy Beane was fond of saying, “and what’s being attrited is pitchers’ arms.”\n\n\nWhat most scouts thought of as a learned skill of secondary importance the A’s management had come, through hard experience, to view virtually as a genetic trait, and the one most likely to lead to baseball success.\n\n\nBaseball players and coaches often used the newspapers to send memos to their general managers.\n\n\n“You don’t walk off the island.” The Dominican hitters were notorious hackers because they had been told they had to be to survive.\n\n\nPlayers of the opposing teams shall not fraternize at any time while in uniform. —Official Baseball Rule 3.09 By the summer of 2002, the memo might as well have been addressed directly to Scott Hatteberg. First base as he played it became a running social event. “Guys come to first,” he said, “and they step into my little office. And I do like to chat.”\n\n\nHis father didn’t have any particular ambition for him, except that he should be happy, remain a Christian, and that his happiness and his Christianity should occur within the confines of Mississippi.\n\n\nAs Chad watched the tape of his old self, Peterson made his point. “You’re a Christian, right, Chad?” “Yeah.” “You believe in Jesus?” “Yeah.” “Have you ever seen him?” “No, I’ve never seen him.” “Ever seen yourself get hitters out?” “Yeah.” “So why the fuck do you have faith in Jesus when you never seen him, but you don’t have faith in your ability to get hitters out when you get hitters out all the time?”\n\n\n*James had observed in baseball what he called a “law of competitive balance.” “There exists in the world a negative momentum,” he wrote, which acts constantly to reduce the differences between strong teams and weak teams, teams which are ahead and teams which are behind, or good players and poor players. The corollaries are:\n\nEvery form of strength covers one weakness and creates another, and therefore every form of strength is also a form of weakness and every weakness a strength.\nThe balance of strategies always favors the team which is behind.\nPsychology tends to pull the winners down and push the losers upwards.\n\n\n\nCalculated that the average difference in baseball due to skill is about one run a game, while the average difference due to luck is about four runs a game. Over a long season the luck evens out, and the skill shines through. But in a series of three out of five, or even four out of seven, anything can happen. In a five-game series, the worst team in baseball will beat the best about 15 percent of the time; the Devil Rays have a prayer against the Yankees.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Wounded-Tigris":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/History/Wounded-Tigris","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/History/Wounded Tigris.md","title":"Wounded Tigris","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/The-Alchemy-of-Air"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","travel-guide","travel","history","gulf","mesopotamia","turkey","iraq","syria","history/british"],"content":"Wounded Tigris\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA modern journey through the mesopotamia and its ancient history.\n🎨 Impressions\nAs noted in The Alchemy of Air impressions, the evilness of ISIS is so petty and profound that I cannot describe it properly.\nIt is the boring pettishnes of these regimes that is so nagging and disgusting.\nThe amount of pollution as well as the river dams where described in a very sober tone, I hope the future is brighter.\nI was also funny, that one of the officers encoutered by the team had gone to school with Baghdadhi (Leader of ISIS)\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nMesopotamia, or ‘the Land Between Two Rivers’.\n\n\nOur friend Ameer confided that he sometimes had sleepless nights about what the future held for his five-year-old son, Mo. ‘I’ve brought him into a hell,’ he told us. ‘How do I justify that to him?’\n\n\nThe fame of these two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, is such that we need not describe them. Ibn Jubayr, Travels, 1184\n\n\nHe told us that for the next forty miles, through Diyarbakır and Bismil, the Turkish state had downgraded the Tigris from a river to a stream. ‘If it was a river, it would need to be protected, and there are international regulations,’ he said. But the reduced flow coming from the dams gave the government scope to change the designation, and on a stream there are fewer restrictions. That removed legal protection against mining and building on the banks, said Bişar.\n\n\nA portrait of Atatürk hung on the wall, and when I asked about it the owner shrugged and said, ‘He wasn’t nearly as bad as what came later.’\n\n\nThe town had met nine of the ten criteria for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Only one is needed, but a submission can only be made by the government, and Turkey refused to.\n\n\nIt had been a busy morning, Said told us. A Russian military patrol had come through Ein Dewar and kids had thrown rocks at it. Then the Americans came through and children cheered.\n\n\nIt was well known, he said, that east of the Euphrates had American influence, and the rest had Russian, but both patrolled in the north-east, and often encountered one another on minor roads. The Americans were still popular, despite Donald Trump’s actions in 2019.\n\n\nIn our short exchange, Mohammed used the word motherfucker six times.\n\n\nThe Euphrates provides over 80 per cent of the fresh water in Syria, and unsurprisingly Syrians pay closer attention to it than the Tigris.\n\n\nThe corrupt elite, like the man we’d met the night before, did what they liked, and everything worked on a system of wasta, or connections.\n\n\nPopular Mobilisation Forces, or Hashd al-Shaabi in Arabic. This umbrella group of militias had been formed in 2014 in a desperate response to the speed with which ISIS was overrunning the country.I\n\n\nIt had all been razed by Da’esh, Ibrahim said.II He remembered when they arrived. It was 6 August 2014. ‘They came in pickups. It was about two months after they’d taken over Mosul,’ he recalled. He had fled, along with most other workers, and the dam was taken quickly. ‘We knew they wouldn’t let Christians live,’ said the man on the pew. ‘Anyone who stayed, hid. Our brothers kept them hidden.’ He gestured to Ibrahim as representative of Muslims who protected them.\n\n\nVarious reports made by American and European companies, as well as a public warning from the US Embassy in Iraq, suggest that roughly six million people are at threat if the dam was to breach. In a worst-case scenario, a tsunami wave eighty-five feet high would crash over the earth-fill embankment, reaching the city of Mosul in an hour and forty minutes. Anyone within a three and a half mile radius of the river would be washed away. Further south, the majority of Iraq’s wheat fields would be flooded as the wave engulfed Shirqat, Tikrit and Samarra, before arriving sixteen-feet high in Baghdad within four days. Between half a million and a million and a half people could die, and many times more than that displaced.\n\n\nMosul Dam had the potential to fail rather suddenly, and it was entirely the product of ego and poor planning and a broken system.\n\n\nSix million people were displaced in Iraq by ISIS, and in this area there had been heavy damage by coalition airstrikes attempting to remove militants holed up in civilian homes.\n\n\nIn Iraq, tribes are organised patriarchally and hierarchically, and every individual in the country is a member of one. Each tribe, or ‘ashira, claims a shared patrilineal ancestry, and that common bloodline creates a bond of solidarity with other members. There are around 150 tribes in Iraq, and their structure generally comprises extended families at the most basic level, which are organised as houses, or sub-clans, and then categorised more broadly into clans. Each clan has a sheikh to lead them, and related clans are led by a general sheikh.\n\n\n‘I knew a man from Gayara once,’ he said. ‘It was 2004, and he decided he needed to make Hajj, so he went to Damascus to get the flight. When he got there, the plane to Mecca was cancelled. So he went to the coast, to the nightclubs in Latakia. In one of the clubs he met another Iraqi, who was shocked to see him. Why are you here, he asked the Iraqi? I’m waiting for the flight to Mecca, the man told him. I’ll get rid of all my sins there anyway, so I’m just stocking up!’ The soldiers doubled over at this.\n\n\nISIS ran a lucrative trafficking industry, with looted artefacts, jewellery and more making their way from Iraq and Syria through Turkey or Lebanon to Europe to be sold on to Western buyers. Salem didn’t want to say more on this but later, in Shirqat, a man who didn’t want to be named told us the trafficking continues, and the same people are still involved.\n\n\n‘We get our news from Facebook,’ he said. ‘I ask my son to look each day and tell me what’s happening.’ There had been no delegation and no survey.\n\n\nIn Tikrit alone, there may well be over a hundred mansions, built for Saddam, his almost impossibly evil sons and various others close to them, often with swimming pools, lakes, orchards and always – always – gaudy, brash decor.\n\n\nCaptain Saif mentioned rather casually that he had gone to primary school with Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS. This seemed an amazing piece of information to have held on to for so long, especially given how many times I’d heard the story of his gastric bypass. ‘They were a very poor family,’ he said. ‘And very religious. He was a calm, peaceful boy. One time he got hit by a bully, and he just said, do it again, and he stood there. I don’t know what happened.’\n\n\n‘When you have a tree full of fruits, you throw a rock at it,’ he said. ‘This is a saying here. I think Iraq is like that tree. Everyone wants its fruits, and they’re willing to attack it.’\n\n\n‘In Islam, we say teach swimming before writing,’ he told me. ‘Because you can always find someone to read and write for you, but not to swim for you.’\n\n\nBe he philosopher or teacher, historian or poet, lawyer or reformer, modern man will find his prototype and counterpart in ancient Sumer. Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sumerians\n\n\nIt is still a manifestation of the saying: Cairo writes, Beirut prints, Baghdad reads.\n\n\nEven now, Salman can’t talk of this time, except perhaps in his sleep. Throughout our journey, I had learned bits and pieces about his experience. He’d had to have an operation on his left eye because of an injury sustained by the beatings. When, during his detention, international organisations and journalists made statements demanding his release, these were read out to him and he was tortured more as a punishment.\n\n\n‘In our methodology, we say that pollution is like terrorism, but even worse,’ said Ali. ‘Terrorism targets a group of people. Pollution targets millions.\n\n\nGilgamesh visits a man called Utanapishtim, who tells him that the god Enlil was irritated by the noise of the world’s populations, so sent a flood to destroy them. Ea, the god of wisdom, gives Utanapishtim instructions on how to build a boat and what to put on it, including every animal in existence. He, and his animals, are the only survivors.III\n\n\nThe Assyriologist who discovered this, George Smith, was said to have got so excited when he finished the translation that he took off his clothes and danced around his room in the British Museum.\n\n\nEveryone in Kut was conservative, he said. No one thought for themselves. His parents supported Sadr, and so did every other person they knew. What did he think of Sadr, asked Emily, knowing the answer. ‘That he’s a fucking moron,’ said Karrar’s friend.\n\n\nIrrigation is responsible for almost 80 per cent of water usage in Iraq, and for years experts have been encouraging alternatives to the highly wasteful flooding system. One solution would be the widespread introduction of spray and drip irrigation, which uses just a fraction of the water that flooding does. I asked Jaafar about this, but he dismissed it quickly. It required enormous investment, he said, and the government should be responsible for that. But they had no interest, or no money, he said, and he couldn’t afford it himself.\n\n\nHe wanted to remember everything that had once made Al-Hay special, he said. ‘What’s been lost?’ asked Emily. ‘People,’ he said bluntly. There had once been a large Jewish population in Al-Hay. By 1947 they had all gone, driven out, but the haji remembered them well and fondly. There was a synagogue in town, and several houses owned by families who now lived in Israel. Those homes were permanently locked up, and the paint was peeling, but nobody broke in or stole anything, he assured us.\n\n\nIn Baghdad there is a saying: if two fish are fighting in the Tigris, it’s probably the fault of the British.\n\n\nThroughout Iraq, I was regularly told of the closeness of the Abrahamic faiths. Though Iraq had eradicated its Jewish population, I often heard people express regret. No one spoke of the pogrom in Baghdad, of course, the pro-Nazi farhud in 1941 during which two hundred Jews were killed, nor of the increasing persecution the community had faced in the lead-up to the creation of the state of Israel. The Iraqi Jewish population, whose history goes back to the sixth century BC in Babylonia and whose number was at least 150,000 in 1948, almost completely disappeared over the course of a couple of years. Most emigrated to Israel, where there is still a large community. People rarely mentioned this. But I had been surprised at how often the Jewish heritage of Iraq was conjured by those we met along the river, and cited as one of the tragic and irreplaceable losses of the country’s history.\n\n\nNow the imam said that because of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which was ongoing, he could not include Jews in the brotherhood of peace.\n\n\nSeventy per cent of Iraq’s crude oil comes from Basra, and we were never far from the impact of the industry.\n\n\nOnly Russia flares more natural gas than Iraq. But Russia, like all the other countries with large volumes of gas released by oil production, is a net exporter. Iraq does the opposite. It both flares off its own supply and simultaneously imports gas from Iran that is burned for power. This is costly not only financially, to the tune of seven billion dollars a year, but also environmentally, and creates a dependency on its neighbour for an essential service. That, of course, is the point, and is one clear demonstration of Iranian influence over Iraq’s political system.\n\n\nIraqis had called Basra ‘the Black City’, and the country produced 75 per cent of the world’s dates.\n\n\nIn the summer of 2018, at least 118,000 Basrawis were taken to hospital with gastrointestinal illness caused by poisoned water.\n\n\nLined up along the bank, dressed in white dishdashas with red and white scarves, was a band ready to play for a small gathered crowd. The musicians were black Iraqis, part of a population of an estimated one and a half to two million, whose ancestors came from the east coast of Africa as early as the eighth century. At that time Iraq was the centre of the East African slave trade. The majority of black Iraqis live in Basra, and Ameer wanted us to hear some of their music.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Influence-":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Influence-","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Influence .md","title":"Influence ","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","psychology"],"content":"Influence\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about people and how the people interact.\n🎨 Impressions\nAs soon as (Frank) Zappa had been introduced and seated, the following exchange occurred: Pyne: I guess your long hair makes you a girl. Zappa: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table.*\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them. –Alfred North Whitehead\n\n\nAlthough several important similarities exist between this kind of automaticity in humans and lower animals, there are some important differences as well. The automatic behavior patterns of humans tend to be learned rather than inborn, more flexible than the lock-step patterns of the lower animals, and responsive to a larger number of triggers.\n\n\nLanger demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I’m in a rush?” The effectiveness of this request plus-reason was nearly total: 94 percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?” Under those circumstances only 60 percent of those asked complied.\n\n\nPerhaps the common “because … just because” response of children asked to explain their behavior can be traced to their shrewd recognition of the unusual amount of power adults appear to assign to the word because.\n\n\nIn marketing lore, the classic case of this phenomenon is that of Chivas Regal Scotch Whiskey, which had been a struggling brand until its managers decided to raise its price to a level far above its competitors. Sales skyrocketed, even though nothing was changed in the product itself (Aaker, 1991). A recent brain-scan study helps explain why. When tasting the same wine, participants not only rated themselves as experiencing more pleasure if they thought it cost 45 versus 5, their brain centers associated with pleasure became more activated by the experience as well .\n\n\nJapanese proverb makes this point eloquently: “There’s nothing more expensive than that which comes for free.”\n\n\nTermed judgmental heuristics, these shortcuts operate in much the same fashion as the expensive = good rule, allowing for simplified thinking that works well most of the time but leaves us open to occasional, costly mistakes. Especially relevant to this book are those heuristics that tell us when to believe or do what we are told.\n\n\nIt’s instructive that even though we often don’t take a complex approach to personally important topics, we wish our advisors—our physicians, accountants, lawyers, and brokers—to do precisely that for us (Kahn &amp; Baron, 1995). When feeling overwhelmed by a complicated and consequential choice, we still want a fully considered, point-by-point analysis of it—an analysis we may not be able to achieve except, ironically enough, through a shortcut: reliance on an expert.\n\n\nPerhaps nowhere is this last point driven home more dramatically than in the life-and-death consequences of a phenomenon that airline industry officials have labeled Captainitis. Accident investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration have noted that, frequently, an obvious error made by a flight captain was not corrected by the other crew members and resulted in a crash.\n\n\nApparently, the tendency of males to be bamboozled by powerful mating signals extends to humans. Two University of Vienna biologists, Astrid Juette and Karl Grammer secretly exposed young men to airborne chemicals (called copulins) that mimic human vaginal scents. The men then rated the attractiveness of women’s faces. Exposure to the copulins increased the judged attractiveness of all the women and masked the genuine physical attractiveness differences among them\n\n\nSuppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store and says that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money? Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend much more on the purchase of a sweater; but the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. The\n\n\nMuch of the compliance process (wherein one person is spurred to comply with another person’s request) can be understood in terms of a human tendency for automatic, shortcut responding. Most individuals in our culture have developed a set of trigger features for compliance, that is, a set of specific pieces of information that normally tell us when compliance with a request is likely to be correct and beneficial.\n\n\nWhile small in scope, this study shows the action of one of the most potent of the weapons of influence around us—the rule of reciprocation. The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. If a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return; if a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours. By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like.\n\n\nFor the most part, however, there is a genuine distaste for an individual who fails to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule\n\n\nInterestingly enough, a cross-cultural study has shown that those who break the reciprocity rule in the reverse direction—by giving without allowing the recipient an opportunity to repay—are also disliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of the three nationalities investigated—Americans, Swedes, and Japanese\n\n\nA student in one of my classes expressed it quite plainly in a paper she wrote: “After learning the hard way, I no longer let a guy I meet in a club buy me a drink because I don’t want either of us to feel that I am obligated sexually.” Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern. If, instead of paying for them herself, a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him\n\n\nResearch conducted at BarIlan University in Israel on the rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires\n\n\nAgainst a requester who employs the rule for reciprocation, you and I face a formidable foe. By presenting us with either an initial favor or an initial concession, the requester will have enlisted a powerful ally in the campaign for our compliance. At first glance, our fortunes in such a situation would appear dismal. We could comply with the requester’s wish and, in so doing, succumb to the reciprocity rule. Or, we could refuse to comply and thereby suffer the brunt of the rule’s force upon our deeply conditioned feelings of fairness and obligation. Surrender or suffer heavy casualties.\n\n\nMerely define whatever you have received from the inspector—extinguisher, safety information, hazard inspection—not as gifts but as sales devices, and you will be free to decline (or accept) the purchase offer without even a tug from the reciprocity rule: A favor rightly follows a favor—not a piece of sales strategy.\n\n\nAccording to sociologists and anthropologists, one of the most widespread and basic norms of human culture is embodied in the rule for reciprocation. The rule requires that one person try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided. By obligating the recipient of an act to repayment in the future, the rule for reciprocation allows one individual to give something to another with confidence that it is not being lost. This sense of future obligation within the rule makes possible the development of various kinds of continuing relationships, transactions, and exchanges that are beneficial to the society. Consequently, all members of the society are trained from childhood to abide by the rule or suffer serious social disapproval.\n\n\nThe decision to comply with another’s request is frequently influenced by the reciprocity rule. One favorite and profitable tactic of certain compliance professionals is to give something before asking for a return favor.\n\n\nIt is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end. –Leonardo Da Vinci\n\n\nOnce we make a choice or take a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.\n\n\nFor instance, immediately after casting a ballot, voters believe more strongly that their candidate will win\n\n\nA quote attributed to the great British chemist, Michael Faraday, suggests the extent to which being consistent is approved—sometimes more than being right. When asked after a lecture if he meant to imply that a hated academic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, “He’s not that consistent.”\n\n\nIf I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment. Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand. Even preliminary leanings that occur before a final decision has to be made can bias us toward consistent subsequent choices\n\n\nCommitment practices involving substantially more finesse can be just as effective. For instance, suppose you wanted to increase the number of people in your area who would agree to go door-to-door collecting donations for your favorite charity. You would be wise to study the approach taken by social psychologist Steven J. Sherman. He simply called a sample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents as part of a survey he was taking and asked them to predict what they would say if asked to spend three hours collecting money for the American Cancer Society. Of course, not wanting to seem uncharitable to the survey-taker or to themselves, many of these people said that they would volunteer.\n\n\nOther groups of people interested in compliance are also aware of the usefulness and power of this approach. Charitable organizations, for instance, will often use progressively escalating commitments to induce individuals to perform major favors. Research has shown that such trivial first commitments as agreeing to be interviewed can begin a “momentum of compliance” that induces such later behaviors as organ or bone marrow donations\n\n\nThe general idea is to pave the way for full-line distribution by starting with a small order… . Look at it this way—when a person has signed an order for your merchandise, even though the profit is so small it hardly compensates for the time and effort of making the call, he is no longer a prospect—he is a customer.\n\n\nWhat may occur is a change in the person’s feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.\n\n\nFor example, it worked successfully for Charles DeGaulle, whose remarkable achievements for France were said to be matched only by his ego. When asked to explain why announcing to everyone that he would stop his heavy smoking obliged him to quit forever, he is reported to have replied gravely, “DeGaulle cannot go back on his word”\n\n\nThe evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it. We can find that evidence quite nearby or as far away as the back regions of the primitive world.\n\n\nInitiation rites of tribal and fraternal societies: They simply will not die. Resisting all attempts to eliminate or suppress them, such hazing practices have been phenomenally resilient. Authorities, in the form of colonial governments or university administrations, have tried threats, social pressures, legal actions, banishments, bribes, and bans to persuade groups to remove the hazards and humiliations from their initiation ceremonies.\n\n\nThere is another striking similarity between the initiation rites of tribal and fraternal societies: They simply will not die. Resisting all attempts to eliminate or suppress them, such hazing practices have been phenomenally resilient. Authorities, in the form of colonial governments or university administrations, have tried threats, social pressures, legal actions, banishments, bribes, and bans to persuade groups to remove the hazards and humiliations from their initiation ceremonies. None has been successful.\n\n\n“If hazing is a universal human activity, and every bit of evidence points to this conclusion, you most likely won’t be able to ban it effectively. Refuse to allow it openly and it will go underground. You can’t ban sex, you can’t prohibit alcohol, and you probably can’t eliminate hazing!”\n\n\nIndeed, one study of 54 tribal cultures found that those with the most dramatic and stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the greatest group solidarity.\n\n\nGiven Aronson and Mills’ demonstration that the severity of an initiation ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer’s commitment to the group, it is hardly surprising that groups will oppose all attempts to eliminate this crucial link to their future strength.\n\n\nA pledge who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward. No, the fraternity chapters and Chinese Communists were playing for keeps. It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions.\n\n\nIt suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want our children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take.\n\n\nThe only effective defense I know against the weapons of influence embodied in the combined principles of commitment and consistency is an awareness that, although consistency is generally good, even vital, there is a foolish, rigid variety to be shunned. We must be wary of the tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of those who want to exploit the mechanical commitment-consistency sequence for profit.\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise that people with a particularly strong proclivity toward consistency in their attitudes and actions fall frequent victim to consistency-based influence tactics. Indeed, research I conducted that developed a scale to measure preference for consistency found just that; individuals who scored high on preference for consistency were especially likely to comply with a requester who used the foot-in-the-door or the low-ball technique\n\n\nWhat might be more surprising is that in a follow-up study employing subjects from ages 18 to 80, we found that preference for consistency increased with the years and that, once beyond the age of 50, our subjects displayed the strongest inclination of all to remain consistent with their earlier commitments\n\n\nAn intensive examination of the tapes by researchers Anthony Pratkanis and Doug Shadel (2005) revealed widespread attempts by the fraud artists to get—or sometimes just claim—an initial small commitment from a target and then to extract funds by holding the target accountable for it. Note how, in the following separate tape excerpts, the scammer uses the consistency principle like a bludgeon on people whose preference for personal consistency gives that weapon formidable weight.\n\n\nWhere all think alike, no one thinks very much. —Walter Lippmann\n\n\nExperiments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier (Provine, 2000). In addition, some evidence indicates that canned laughter is most effective for poor jokes\n\n\nThe principle of social proof. This principle states that we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct\n\n\nWe view a behavior as correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.\n\n\n“Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.”\n\n\nThe group members had gone too far, given up too much for their beliefs to see them destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, the mockery would be too great to bear. The overarching need of the cultists to cling to those beliefs seeps poignantly from their own words.\n\n\nThis, then, explains their sudden shift from secretive conspirators to zealous missionaries. It also explains the curious timing of the shift—precisely when a direct disconfirmation of their beliefs had rendered them least convincing to outsiders. It was necessary to risk the scorn and derision of the nonbelievers because publicity and recruitment efforts provided the only remaining hope. If they could spread the Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer.\n\n\nThe principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more a given individual will perceive the idea to be correct.\n\n\nThey examined the reports of the Genovese incident and, on the basis of their knowledge of social psychology, hit on what had seemed like the most unlikely explanation of all—the fact that 38 witnesses were present. Previous accounts of the story had invariably emphasized that no action was taken, even though 38 individuals had looked on. Latané and Darley suggested that no one had helped precisely because there were so many observers.\n\n\nWithout question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to use others’ actions to decide how they themselves should act. In addition, there is another important working condition: similarity. The principle of social proof operates most powerfully when we are observing the behavior of people just like us\n\n\nFatal crashes increase dramatically only in those regions where the suicide has been highly publicized.\n\n\nIt consisted of offering people just two things: a fair price and someone they liked to buy from. “And that’s it,” he claimed in an interview. “Finding the salesman you like, plus the price. Put them both together, and you get a deal.”\n\n\nA halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. The evidence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.\n\n\nEconomists examining U.S. and Canadian samples have found that attractive individuals get paid an average of 12–14 percent more than their unattractive coworkers\n\n\nThe information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance\n\n\nHow could such a thing happen? The answer lies partially in the unconscious way that familiarity affects liking. Often we don’t realize that our attitude toward something has been influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past. For example, in one experiment, the faces of several individuals were flashed on a screen so quickly that, later on, the subjects who were exposed to the faces in this manner couldn’t recall having seen any of them before. Yet, the more frequently a person’s face was flashed on the screen, the more these subjects came to like that person when they met in a subsequent interaction.\n\n\nFor instance, although white students’ achievement levels remain steady, it is 10 times more likely that the academic performance of minority students will significantly increase rather than significantly decline after desegregation (Stephan, 1978).\n\n\nFirst, restaurant patrons gave larger tips when paying with a credit card instead of cash. In a second study, college students were willing to spend an average of 29 percent more money for mail-order catalog items when they examined the items in a room that contained some MasterCard insignias; moreover, they had no awareness that the credit card insignias were part of the experiment.\n\n\nPeople prefer to say yes to individuals they know and like. Recognizing this rule, compliance professionals commonly increase their effectiveness by emphasizing several factors that increase their overall attractiveness and likeability.\n\n\nA second factor that influences liking and compliance is similarity. We like people who are like us, and we are more willing to say yes to their requests, often in an unthinking manner. Another factor that produces liking is praise. Although they can sometimes backfire when crudely transparent, compliments generally enhance liking and, thus, compliance.\n\n\nIncreased familiarity through repeated contact with a person or thing is yet another factor that normally facilitates liking. This relationship holds true principally when the contact takes place under positive rather than negative circumstances. One positive circumstance that works especially well is mutual and successful cooperation. A fifth factor linked to liking is association. By connecting themselves or their products with positive things, advertisers, politicians, and merchandisers frequently seek to share in the positivity through the process of association.\n\n\nPotentially effective strategy for reducing the unwanted influence of liking on compliance decisions requires a special sensitivity to the experience of undue liking for a requester.\n\n\nThat 95 percent of regular staff nurses complied unhesitatingly with a patently improper instruction of this sort must give us all as potential hospital patients great reason for concern. What the midwestern study shows is that the mistakes are hardly limited to the trivial slips in the administration of harmless ear drops or the like, but extend to grave and dangerous blunders.\n\n\nThe experimenters discovered that motorists would wait significantly longer before honking their horns at a new, luxury car stopped in front of a green traffic light than at an older, economy model. The motorists had little patience with the economy-car driver: Nearly all sounded their horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply rammed into the rear bumper.\n\n\nOne protective tactic we can use against authority status is to remove its element of surprise. Because we typically misperceive the profound impact of authority (and its symbols) on our actions, we become insufficiently cautious about its presence in compliance situations.\n\n\nFor example, one study found that letters of recommendation sent to the personnel directors of major corporations produced the most favorable results for job candidates when the letters contained one unflattering comment about the candidate in an otherwise wholly positive set of specific remarks\n\n\nIn the Milgram studies of obedience we can see evidence of strong pressure in our society for compliance with the requests of an authority. Acting contrary to their own preferences, many normal, psychologically healthy individuals were willing to deliver dangerous and severe levels of pain to another person because they were directed to do so by an authority figure.\n\n\nIt is possible to defend ourselves against the detrimental effects of authority influence by asking two questions: Is this authority truly an expert? How truthful can we expect this expert to be?\n\n\nThat opportunities seem more valuable to us when they are less available—\n\n\nEspecially under conditions of risk and uncertainty, the threat of potential loss plays a powerful role in human decision making\n\n\nFor instance, it is little recognized that at the time of the American Revolution, the colonists had the highest standard of living and the lowest taxes in the Western World. According to historian Thomas Fleming (1997), it wasn’t until the British sought a cut of this widespread prosperity (by levying taxes) that the Americans revolted.\n\n\nFreedoms once granted will not be relinquished without a fight.\n\n\nPart of the problem is that our typical reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to think. When we watch as something we want becomes less available, a physical agitation sets in.\n\n\nFortunately there is information available on which we can base thoughtful decisions about scarce items. It comes, once again, from the chocolate chip cookie study, where the researchers uncovered something that seems strange but rings true regarding scarcity: Even though the scarce cookies were rated as significantly more desirable, they were not rated as any better-tasting than the abundant cookies.\n\n\nThe joy is not in the experiencing of a scarce commodity but in the possessing of it.\n\n\nFirst, scarce items are heightened in value when they are newly scarce. That is, we value those things that have become recently restricted more than those that were restricted all along. Second, we are most attracted to scarce resources when we compete with others for them.\n\n\nSome people claimed that Pyne’s acid personal style was partially caused by a leg amputation that had embittered him to life; others said, no, he was just vituperative by nature. One evening rock musician Frank Zappa was a guest on the show. This was at a time in the 1960s when very long hair on men was still unusual and controversial. As soon as Zappa had been introduced and seated, the following exchange occurred: Pyne: I guess your long hair makes you a girl. Zappa: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table.\n\n\nVery often when we make a decision about someone or something we don’t use all of the relevant available information. We use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Interpretable-Machine-Learning":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Interpretable-Machine-Learning","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Interpretable Machine Learning.md","title":"Interpretable Machine Learning","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","machine-learning/models","machine-learning/feature-engineering","machine-learning/modeling","machine-learning/ml-engineering","interpretable-machine-learning","explainable-ai","data","data-science"],"content":"Interpretable Machine Learning\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about methods and ways to understand AI and data modeling and how to utilize the different ways of interpreting machine learning models. It gives the basis and then dives into the different types of models and methods you can use.  It separates the models into specific to models or model families, and model agnostic.\n🎨 Impressions\nUnderstand how the different ways of interpreting the models are.  Especially model-agnostic versus model-specific.\nExplainable AI is difficult to explain and might not be the same as true AI.\nA lot of the model-agnostic methods are based on data or utilizing some sort of check on inference to understand the impact of changes.\nA lot of the most important things from a human-explainable AI viewpoint is finding a couple of reasons that people can understand and think is the important ones.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWould learn patterns from past house sales. The book focuses on supervised machine learning, which covers all prediction problems where we have a dataset for which we already know the outcome of interest (e.g. past house prices) and want to learn to predict the outcome for new data.\n\n\nA Learner or Machine Learning Algorithm is the program used to learn a machine learning model from data. Another name is “inducer”\n\n\nInterpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. Another one is: Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model’s result\n\n\nMachine learning models can only be debugged and audited when they can be interpreted.\n\n\nIntrinsic interpretability refers to machine learning models that are considered interpretable due to their simple structure, such as short decision trees or sparse linear models.\n\n\nPost hoc interpretability refers to the application of interpretation methods after model training. Permutation feature importance is, for example, a post hoc interpretation method.\n\n\nFeature summary statistic : Many interpretation methods provide summary statistics for each feature. Some methods return a single number per feature, such as feature importance, or a more complex result, such as the pairwise feature interaction strengths, which consist of a number for each feature pair.\n\n\nAlgorithm transparency is about how the algorithm learns a model from the data and what kind of relationships it can learn. If you use convolutional neural networks to classify images, you can explain that the algorithm learns edge detectors and filters on the lowest layers.\n\n\nAn explanation usually relates the feature values of an instance to its model prediction in a humanly understandable way.\n\n\nTranslucency describes how much the explanation method relies on looking into the machine learning model, like its parameters. For example, explanation methods relying on intrinsically interpretable models like the linear regression model (model-specific) are highly translucent.  Methods only relying on manipulating inputs and observing the predictions have zero translucency.\n\n\nFidelity: How well does the explanation approximate the prediction of the black box model? High fidelity is one of the most important properties of an explanation, because an explanation with low fidelity is useless to explain the machine learning model.\n\n\nConsistency: How much does an explanation differ between models that have been trained on the same task and that produce similar predictions?\n\n\nAccuracy : How well does an explanation predict unseen data? High accuracy is especially important if the explanation is used for predictions in place of the machine learning model.\n\n\nComprehensibility: How well do humans understand the explanations? This looks just like one more property among many, but it is the elephant in the room. Difficult to define and measure, but extremely important to get right.\n\n\nStability: How similar are the explanations for similar instances? While consistency compares explanations between models, stability compares explanations between similar instances for a fixed model. High stability means that slight variations in the features of an instance do not substantially change the explanation\n\n\nCertainty: Does the explanation reflect the certainty of the machine learning model? Many machine learning models only give predictions without a statement about the models confidence that the prediction is correct.\n\n\nDegree of Importance: How well does the explanation reflect the importance of features or parts of the explanation? For example, if a decision rule is generated as an explanation for an individual prediction, is it clear which of the conditions of the rule was the most important?\n\n\nAs an explanation for an event, humans prefer short explanations (only 1 or 2 causes) that contrast the current situation with a situation in which the event would not have occurred. Especially abnormal causes provide good explanations. Explanations are social interactions between the explainer and the explainee (recipient of the explanation) and therefore the social context has a great influence on the actual content of the explanation.\n\n\nAn explanation is the answer to a why-question\n\n\nHumans usually do not ask why a certain prediction was made, but why this prediction was made instead of another prediction. We tend to think in counterfactual cases, i.e. “How would the prediction have been if input X had been different?“.\n\n\nExplanations are selected . People do not expect explanations that cover the actual and complete list of causes of an event. We are used to selecting one or two causes from a variety of possible causes as THE explanation. As proof, turn on the TV news: “The decline in stock prices is blamed on a growing backlash against the company’s product due to problems with the latest software update.”\n\n\nThe fact that an event can be explained by various causes is called the Rashomon Effect. Rashomon is a Japanese movie that tells alternative, contradictory stories (explanations) about the death of a samurai.\n\n\nHave the same influence on the prediction as the abnormal one.\n\n\nExplanations are truthful. Good explanations prove to be true in reality (i.e. in other situations). But disturbingly, this is not the most important factor for a “good” explanation. For example, selectiveness seems to be more important than truthfulness.\n\n\nAn explanation that selects only one or two possible causes rarely covers the entire list of relevant causes.\n\n\nThe easiest way to achieve interpretability is to use only a subset of algorithms that create interpretable models. Linear regression, logistic regression and the decision tree are commonly used interpretable models.\n\n\nMonotonicity is useful for the interpretation of a model because it makes it easier to understand a relationship.\n\n\nThe biggest advantage of linear regression models is linearity: It makes the estimation procedure simple and, most importantly, these linear equations have an easy to understand interpretation on a modular level (i.e. the weights).\n\n\nThe variance of the error terms is assumed to be constant over the entire feature space.\n\n\nLasso stands for “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator”\n\n\nLinear regression and logistic regression models fail in situations where the relationship between features and outcome is nonlinear or where features interact with each other.\n\n\nSearch for mixed models or generalized estimating equations.\n\n\nFor example, when predicting the value of a house, the model errors are usually higher in expensive houses, which violates the homoscedasticity of the linear model. Search for robust regression.\n\n\nI have outliers that strongly influence my model. Search for robust regression.\n\n\nSearch for parametric survival models, cox regression, survival analysis.\n\n\nIf you have more categories, search for multinomial regression.\n\n\nI want to integrate prior knowledge into my models. Search for Bayesian inference.\n\n\nTrees fail to deal with linear relationships. Any linear relationship between an input feature and the outcome has to be approximated by splits, creating a step function. This is not efficient.\n\n\nThis goes hand in hand with lack of smoothness. Slight changes in the input feature can have a big impact on the predicted outcome, which is usually not desirable.\n\n\nTrees are also quite unstable. A few changes in the training dataset can create a completely different tree. This is because each split depends on the parent split.\n\n\nDecision trees are very interpretable — as long as they are short. The number of terminal nodes increases quickly with depth.\n\n\nSupport or coverage of a rule: The percentage of instances to which the condition of a rule applies is called the support.\n\n\nThe accuracy of a rule is a measure of how accurate the rule is in predicting the correct class for the instances to which the condition of the rule applies.\n\n\nUsually there is a trade-off between accuracy and support: By adding more features to the condition, we can achieve higher accuracy, but lose support.\n\n\nA decision list introduces an order to the decision rules. If the condition of the first rule is true for an instance, we use the prediction of the first rule.\n\n\nA decision set resembles a democracy of the rules, except that some rules might have a higher voting power.\n\n\nIF-THEN rules are easy to interpret. They are probably the most interpretable of the interpretable models. This statement only applies if the number of rules is small, the conditions of the rules are short (maximum 3 I would say) and if the rules are organized in a decision list or a non-overlapping decision set.\n\n\nDecision rules can be as expressive as decision trees, while being more compact.\n\n\nThe research and literature for IF-THEN rules focuses on classification and almost completely neglects regression. While you can always divide a continuous target into intervals and turn it into a classification problem, you always lose information.\n\n\nOften the features also have to be categorical. That means numeric features must be categorized if you want to use them.\n\n\nThe great advantage of model-agnostic interpretation methods over model-specific ones is their flexibility. Machine learning developers are free to use any machine learning model they like when the interpretation methods can be applied to any model. Anything that builds on an interpretation of a machine learning model, such as a graphic or user interface, also becomes independent of the underlying machine learning model.\n\n\nExplanation flexibility: You are not limited to a certain form of explanation. In some cases it might be useful to have a linear formula, in other cases a graphic with feature importances. Representation flexibility: The explanation system should be able to use a different feature representation as the model being explained. For a text classifier that uses abstract word embedding vectors, it might be preferable to use the presence of individual words for the explanation.\n\n\nThe lowest layer is the World. This could literally be nature itself, like the biology of the human body and how it reacts to medication, but also more abstract things like the real estate market. The World layer contains everything that can be observed and is of interest. Ultimately, we want to learn something about the World and interact with it. The second layer is the Data layer. We have to digitize the World in order to make it processable for computers and also to store information. The Data layer contains anything from images, texts, tabular data and so on. By fitting machine learning models based on the Data layer, we get the Black Box Model layer. Machine learning algorithms learn with data from the real world to make predictions or find structures. Above the Black Box Model layer is the Interpretability Methods layer, which helps us deal with the opacity of machine learning models. What were the most important features for a particular diagnosis? Why was a financial transaction classified as fraud? The last layer is occupied by a Human. Look! This one waves to you because you are reading this book and helping to provide better explanations for black box models! Humans are ultimately the consumers of the explanations.\n\n\nALE plots are unbiased , which means they still work when features are correlated. Partial dependence plots fail in this scenario because they marginalize over unlikely or even physically impossible combinations of feature values.\n\n\nALE plots can become a bit shaky (many small ups and downs) with a high number of intervals. In this case, reducing the number of intervals makes the estimates more stable, but also smoothes out and hides some of the true complexity of the prediction model. There is no perfect solution for setting the number of intervals.\n\n\nSecond-order ALE estimates have a varying stability across the feature space, which is not visualized in any way. The reason for this is that each estimation of a local effect in a cell uses a different number of data instances.\n\n\nIf a machine learning model makes a prediction based on two features, we can decompose the prediction into four terms: a constant term, a term for the first feature, a term for the second feature and a term for the interaction between the two features.\n\n\nWe measure the importance of a feature by calculating the increase in the model’s prediction error after permuting the feature. A feature is “important” if shuffling its values increases the model error, because in this case the model relied on the feature for the prediction. A feature is “unimportant” if shuffling its values leaves the model error unchanged, because in this case the model ignored the feature for the prediction.\n\n\nIt is very unclear whether you should use training or test data to compute the feature importance.\n\n\nPermutation feature importance is linked to the error of the model. This is not inherently bad, but in some cases not what you need.\n\n\nSurrogate models are trained to approximate the predictions of the underlying black box model. Instead of training a global surrogate model, LIME focuses on training local surrogate models to explain individual predictions.\n\n\nLocal surrogate models are interpretable models that are used to explain individual predictions of black box machine learning models. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME\n\n\nA prediction can be explained by assuming that each feature value of the instance is a “player” in a game where the prediction is the payout. Shapley values — a method from coalitional game theory — tells us how to fairly distribute the “payout” among the features.\n\n\nThe Shapley value is the only attribution method that satisfies the properties Efficiency, Symmetry, Dummy and Additivity, which together can be considered a definition of a fair payout.\n\n\nEfficiency The feature contributions must add up to the difference of prediction for x and the average.\n\n\nSymmetry The contributions of two feature values j and k should be the same if they contribute equally to all possible coalitions.\n\n\nDummy A feature j that does not change the predicted value — regardless of which coalition of feature values it is added to — should have a Shapley value of 0.\n\n\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) by Lundberg and Lee (2016) is a method to explain individual predictions. SHAP is based on the game theoretically optimal Shapley Values.\n\n\nLIME weights the instances according to how close they are to the original instance. The more 0’s in the coalition vector, the smaller the weight in LIME. SHAP weights the sampled instances according to the weight the coalition would get in the Shapley value estimation.\n\n\nKernelSHAP ignores feature dependence . Most other permutation based interpretation methods have this problem. By replacing feature values with values from random instances, it is usually easier to randomly sample from the marginal distribution. However, if features are dependent, e.g. correlated, this leads to putting too much weight on unlikely data points. TreeSHAP solves this problem by explicitly modeling the conditional expected prediction.\n\n\nExample-based explanation methods select particular instances of the dataset to explain the behavior of machine learning models or to explain the underlying data distribution.\n\n\nExample-based explanations are mostly model-agnostic, because they make any machine learning model more interpretable. The difference to model-agnostic methods is that the examplebased methods explain a model by selecting instances of the dataset and not by creating summaries of features\n\n\nExample-based explanations only make sense if we can represent an instance of the data in a humanly understandable way.\n\n\nIn the form: “If X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred”. For example: “If I hadn’t taken a sip of this hot coffee, I wouldn’t have burned my tongue”.\n\n\nA counterfactual explanation describes a causal situation in the form: “If X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred”. For example: “If I hadn’t taken a sip of this hot coffee, I wouldn’t have burned my tongue”.\n\n\nA counterfactual explanation of a prediction describes the smallest change to the feature values that changes the prediction to a predefined output.\n\n\nThere are both model-agnostic and model-specific counterfactual explanation methods,\n\n\nThe counterfactual method does not require access to the data or the model. It only requires access to the model’s prediction function, which would also work via a web API, for example.\n\n\nFor each instance you will usually find multiple counterfactual explanations (Rashomon effect). This is inconvenient - most people prefer simple explanations over the complexity of the real world.\n\n\nAn adversarial example is an instance with small, intentional feature perturbations that cause a machine learning model to make a false prediction.\n\n\n*There are three golden rules in cybersecurity:\n\nknow your adversary\nbe proactive and\nprotect yourself.\n\n\n\nA prototype is a data instance that is representative of all the data. A criticism is a data instance that is not well represented by the set of prototypes.\n\n\nAn influential instance is a data instance whose removal has a strong effect on the trained model. The more the model parameters or predictions change when the model is retrained with a particular instance removed from the training data, the more influential that instance is.\n\n\nHow can we find influential instances? We have two ways of measuring influence: Our first option is to delete the instance from the training data, retrain the model on the reduced training dataset and observe the difference in the model parameters or predictions (either individually or over the complete dataset). The second option is to upweight a data instance by approximating the parameter changes based on the gradients of the model parameters.\n\n\nThe approach of making the learned features explicit is called Feature Visualization. Feature visualization for a unit of a neural network is done by finding the input that maximizes the activation of that unit.\n\n\nFeature visualizations give unique insight into the working of neural networks, especially for image recognition. Given the complexity and opacity of neural networks, feature visualization is an important step in analyzing and describing neural networks.\n\n\nThe focus will be on model-agnostic interpretability tools.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Designing Machine Learning Systems.md","title":"Designing Machine Learning Systems","links":[],"tags":["books","machine-learning","data-science","data-engineering","system-architecture","mlops","non-fiction"],"content":"Designing Machine Learning Systems\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book covers the fundamentals of designing machine learning systems. It goes through the entire lifecycle of a machine learning system and then discusses the ecosystem and the challenges and cases that need to be considered.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a good introduction to the entire machine learning lifecycle, made as an extension of notes from a lecture course from Stanford, it has the credibility of an academic book. It was interesting and quite easy to read.\nHow I Discovered It\nI discovered it as I wanted to become more proficient in reading about data science and machine learning and understanding the whole system.\nWho Should Read It?\nData scientists in small companies, preferably before you get too much experience.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThis book is for anyone who wants to leverage ML to solve real-world problems. ML in this book refers to both deep learning and classical algorithms, with a leaning toward ML systems at scale, such as those seen at medium to large enterprises and fast-growing startups.\n\n\nIn November 2016, Google announced that it had incorporated its multilingual neural machine translation system into Google Translate, marking one of the first success stories of deep artificial neural networks in production at scale. According to Google, with this update, the quality of translation improved more in a single leap than they had seen in the previous 10 years combined.\n\n\nMachine learning is an approach to learning complex patterns from existing data and using these patterns to make predictions on unseen data.\n\n\nIn English, “predict” means “estimate a value in the future.”\n\n\nML is especially suitable when the cost of a wrong prediction is low. For example, one of the biggest use cases of ML today is in recommender systems because with recommender systems, a bad recommendation is usually forgiving—the user just won’t click on the recommendation.\n\n\nDeciding how much to charge for your product or service is probably one of the hardest business decisions; why not let ML do it for you? Price optimization is the process of estimating a price at a certain time period to maximize a defined objective function, such as the company’s margin, revenue, or growth rate. ML-based pricing optimization is most suitable for cases with a large number of transactions where demand fluctuates and consumers are willing to pay a dynamic price—\n\n\nAcquiring a new user is expensive. As of 2019, the average cost for an app to acquire a user who’ll make an in-app purchase is 86.61.9 The acquisition cost for Lyft is estimated at 158/rider. This cost is so much higher for enterprise customers. Customer acquisition cost is hailed by investors as a startup killer.\n\n\nTypically, the percentiles you’ll want to look at are p90, p95, and p99. The 90th percentile (p90) for the 10 requests above is 3,000 ms, which is an outlier.\n\n\nFor example, on the Amazon website, the customers with the slowest requests are often those who have the most data on their accounts because they have made many purchases—that is, they’re the most valuable customers.\n\n\nIn 2019, “Berkeley researchers found that both face-to-face and online lenders rejected a total of 1.3 million creditworthy Black and Latino applicants between 2008 and 2015.” When the researchers “used the income and credit scores of the rejected applications but deleted the race identifiers, the mortgage application was accepted.”\n\n\nThat’s an excellent idea. In fact, ML production would be a much better place if ML experts were better software engineers.\n\n\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) paper first came out, people were talking about how BERT was too big, too complex, and too slow to be practical.\n\n\nWhile most companies want to convince you otherwise, the sole purpose of businesses, according to the Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman, is to maximize profits for shareholders.\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of any project within a business is, therefore, to increase profits, either directly or indirectly: directly such as increasing sales (conversion rates) and cutting costs;\n\n\nThe specified requirements for an ML system vary from use case to use case. However, most systems should have these four characteristics: reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability.\n\n\nThe system should continue to perform the correct function at the desired level of performance even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error).\n\n\nWhichever way your system grows, there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth. When talking about scalability most people think of resource scaling, which consists of up-scaling (expanding the resources to handle growth) and down-scaling (reducing the resources when not needed).\n\n\nTo adapt to shifting data distributions and business requirements, the system should have some capacity for both discovering aspects for performance improvement and allowing updates without service interruption.\n\n\n*Step 1. Project scoping A project starts with scoping the project, laying out goals, objectives, and constraints. Stakeholders should be identified and involved. Resources should be estimated and allocated. We already discussed different stakeholders and some of the foci for ML projects in production in Chapter 1. We also already discussed how to scope an ML project in the context of a business earlier in this chapter. We’ll discuss how to organize teams to ensure the success of an ML project in Chapter 11.\n\n\nStep 2. Data engineering A vast majority of ML models today learn from data, so developing ML models starts with engineering data. In Chapter 3, we’ll discuss the fundamentals of data engineering, which covers handling data from different sources and formats. With access to raw data, we’ll want to curate training data out of it by sampling and generating labels, which is discussed in Chapter 4.\n\n\nStep 3. ML model development With the initial set of training data, we’ll need to extract features and develop initial models leveraging these features. This is the stage that requires the most ML knowledge and is most often covered in ML courses. In Chapter 5, we’ll discuss feature engineering. In Chapter 6, we’ll discuss model selection, training, and evaluation.\n\n\nStep 4. Deployment After a model is developed, it needs to be made accessible to users. Developing an ML system is like writing—you will never reach the point when your system is done. But you do reach the point when you have to put your system out there. We’ll discuss different ways to deploy an ML model in Chapter 7.\n\n\nStep 5. Monitoring and continual learning Once in production, models need to be monitored for performance decay and maintained to be adaptive to changing environments and changing requirements. This step will be discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.\n\n\nStep 6. Business analysis Model performance needs to be evaluated against business goals and analyzed to generate business insights. These insights can then be used to eliminate unproductive projects or scope out new projects. This step is closely related to the first step.\n\n\nAn ML problem is defined by inputs, outputs, and the objective function that guides the learning process—\n\n\nClassification models classify inputs into different categories. For example, you want to classify each email to be either spam or not spam. Regression models output a continuous value. An example is a house prediction model that outputs the price of a given house.\n\n\nIn my experience, ML models typically need at least 100 examples for each class to learn to classify that class.\n\n\nOut of all task types, multilabel classification is usually the one that I’ve seen companies having the most problems with. Multilabel means that the number of classes an example can have varies from example to example.\n\n\nWithout data, there’s no data science.\n\n\nNote that objective functions are mathematical functions, which are different from the business and ML objectives we discussed earlier in this chapter.\n\n\n*If you want to learn more about data engineering from a systems perspective, I recommend Martin Kleppmann’s excellent book Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n\n\nIf it’s even remotely possible for users to input the wrong data, they are going to do it.\n\n\nFirst-party data is the data that your company already collects about your users or customers. Second-party data is the data collected by another company on their own customers that they make available to you, though you’ll probably have to pay for it. Third-party data companies collect data on the public who aren’t their direct customers.\n\n\nOverall, row-major formats are better when you have to do a lot of writes, whereas column-major ones are better when you have to do a lot of column-based reads.\n\n\nAWS recommends using the Parquet format because “the Parquet format is up to 2x faster to unload and consumes up to 6x less storage in Amazon S3, compared to text formats.”\n\n\nThe most important thing to note about SQL is that it’s a declarative language, as opposed to Python, which is an imperative language. In the imperative paradigm, you specify the steps needed for an action and the computer executes these steps to return the outputs. In the declarative paradigm, you specify the outputs you want, and the computer figures out the steps needed to get you the queried outputs.\n\n\nIn the early days of the relational data model, data was mostly structured. When data is extracted from different sources, it’s first transformed into the desired format before being loaded into the target destination such as a database or a data warehouse. This process is called ETL, which stands for extract, transform, and load.\n\n\nThe two most common types of real-time transports are pubsub, which is short for publish-subscribe, and message queue. In the pubsub model, any service can publish to different topics in a real-time transport, and any service that subscribes to a topic can read all the events in that topic. The services that produce data don’t care about what services consume their data.\n\n\nOnce your data arrives in data storage engines like databases, data lakes, or data warehouses, it becomes historical data.\n\n\nStructured data means that the code that writes the data has to assume the structure. Unstructured data means that the code that reads the data has to assume the structure.\n\n\n“Interesting” in production usually means catastrophic, such as a crash or when your cloud bill hits an astronomical amount.\n\n\nAs of November 2021, AWS S3 Standard, the storage option that allows you to access your data with the latency of milliseconds, costs about five times more per GB than S3 Glacier, the storage option that allows you to retrieve your data with a latency from between 1 minute to 12 hours.\n\n\nAn ML engineer once mentioned to me that his team only used users’ historical product browsing and purchases to make recommendations on what they might like to see next. I responded: “So you don’t use personal data at all?” He looked at me, confused. “If you meant demographic data like users’ age, location, then no, we don’t. But I’d say that a person’s browsing and purchasing activities are extremely personal.”\n\n\nConvenience sampling Samples of data are selected based on their availability. This sampling method is popular because, well, it’s convenient.\n\n\nSnowball sampling Future samples are selected based on existing samples. For example, to scrape legitimate Twitter accounts without having access to Twitter databases, you start with a small number of accounts, then you scrape all the accounts they follow, and so on. Judgment sampling Experts decide what samples to include. Quota sampling You select samples based on quotas for certain slices of data without any randomization. For example, when doing a survey, you might want 100 responses from each of the age groups: under 30 years old, between 30 and 60 years old, and above 60 years old, regardless of the actual age distribution.\n\n\nThe higher the level of domain expertise required, the higher the potential for annotating disagreement.\n\n\nIt’s good practice to keep track of the origin of each of your data samples as well as its labels, a technique known as data lineage. Data lineage helps you both flag potential biases in your data and debug your models.\n\n\nThe canonical example of tasks with natural labels is recommender systems. The goal of a recommender system is to recommend to users items relevant to them.\n\n\nIf hand labeling is so problematic, what if we don’t use hand labels altogether? One approach that has gained popularity is weak supervision. One of the most popular open source tools for weak supervision is Snorkel, developed at the Stanford AI Lab.\n\n\nLibraries like Snorkel are built around the concept of a labeling function (LF): a function that encodes heuristics. The preceding heuristics can be expressed by the following function: def labeling_function(note): if “pneumonia” in note: return “EMERGENT” LFs can encode many different types of heuristics. Here are some of them: Keyword heuristic Such as the preceding example Regular expressions Such as if the note matches or fails to match a certain regular expression Database lookup Such as if the note contains the disease listed in the dangerous disease list The outputs of other models Such as if an existing system classifies this as EMERGENT\n\n\nBecause LFs encode heuristics, and heuristics are noisy, labels produced by LFs are noisy. Multiple LFs might apply to the same data examples, and they might give conflicting labels.\n\n\nA semi-supervision method that has gained popularity in recent years is the perturbation-based method. It’s based on the assumption that small perturbations to a sample shouldn’t change its label. So you apply small perturbations to your training instances to obtain new training instances. The perturbations might be applied directly to the samples (e.g., adding white noise to images) or to their representations (e.g., adding small random values to embeddings of words).\n\n\nActive learning is a method for improving the efficiency of data labels. The hope here is that ML models can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if they can choose which data samples to learn from.\n\n\nAccording to Talos Intelligence, as of May 2021, nearly 85% of all emails are spam.\n\n\nDing et al. showed that very deep neural networks—with “very deep” meaning over 10 layers back in 2017—performed much better on imbalanced data than shallower neural networks.\n\n\nOne such technique is two-phase learning. You first train your model on the resampled data. This resampled data can be achieved by randomly undersampling large classes until each class has only N instances. You then fine-tune your model on the original data.\n\n\nSu et al. showed that 67.97% of the natural images in the Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet test images can be misclassified by changing just one pixel\n\n\nUsing deceptive data to trick a neural network into making wrong predictions is called adversarial attacks. Adding noise to samples is a common technique to create adversarial samples. The success of adversarial attacks is especially exaggerated as the resolution of images increases. Adding noisy samples to training data can help models recognize the weak spots in their learned decision boundary and improve their performance.\n\n\nThe promise of deep learning is that we won’t have to handcraft features. For this reason, deep learning is sometimes called feature learning.\n\n\nNot all types of missing values are equal.\n\n\nIn my experience, how well a person handles missing values for a given dataset during interviews strongly correlates with how well they will do in their day-to-day jobs.\n\n\nMissing not at random (MNAR) This is when the reason a value is missing is because of the true value itself. In this example, we might notice that some respondents didn’t disclose their income. Upon investigation it may turn out that the income of respondents who failed to report tends to be higher than that of those who did disclose.\n\n\nMissing at random (MAR) This is when the reason a value is missing is not due to the value itself, but due to another observed variable. In this example, we might notice that age values are often missing for respondents of the gender “A,” which might be because the people of gender A in this survey don’t like disclosing their age.\n\n\nMissing completely at random (MCAR) This is when there’s no pattern in when the value is missing.\n\n\nWhen I ask candidates about how to handle missing values during interviews, many tend to prefer deletion, not because it’s a better method, but because it’s easier to do.\n\n\nAnother way to delete is row deletion: if a sample has missing value(s), just remove that sample. This method can work when the missing values are completely at random (MCAR) and the number of examples with missing values is small, such as less than 0.1%. You don’t want to do row deletion if that means 10% of your data samples are removed.\n\n\nBefore inputting features into models, it’s important to scale them to be similar ranges. This process is called feature scaling. This is one of the simplest things you can do that often results in a performance boost for your model. Neglecting to do so can cause your model to make gibberish predictions, especially with classical algorithms like gradient-boosted trees and logistic regression.\n\n\nIn practice, ML models tend to struggle with features that follow a skewed distribution. To help mitigate the skewness, a technique commonly used is log transformation: apply the log function to your feature.\n\n\nOne solution to this problem is the hashing trick, popularized by the package Vowpal Wabbit developed at Microsoft. The gist of this trick is that you use a hash function to generate a hashed value of each category. The hashed value will become the index of that category. Because you can specify the hash space, you can fix the number of encoded values for a feature in advance, without having to know how many categories there will be. For example, if you choose a hash space of 18 bits, which corresponds to 218 = 262,144 possible hashed values, all the categories, even the ones that your model has never seen before, will be encoded by an index between 0 and 262,143.\n\n\nBecause it’s a trick, it’s often considered hacky by academics and excluded from ML curricula. But its wide adoption in the industry is a testimonial to how effective the trick is. It’s essential to Vowpal Wabbit and it’s part of the frameworks of scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and gensim.\n\n\nFeature crossing is the technique to combine two or more features to generate new features. This technique is useful to model the nonlinear relationships between features.\n\n\nBoth of these are examples of data leakage. Data leakage refers to the phenomenon when a form of the label “leaks” into the set of features used for making predictions, and this same information is not available during inference.\n\n\nData leakage refers to the phenomenon when a form of the label “leaks” into the set of features used for making predictions, and this same information is not available during inference.\n\n\nWhen measuring feature importance for a click-through rate prediction model, the ads team at Facebook found out that the top 10 features are responsible for about half of the model’s total feature importance, whereas the last 300 features contribute less than 1% feature importance, as shown\n\n\nZen of Python states that “simple is better than complex,” and this principle is applicable to ML as well.\n\n\nSimplicity serves three purposes. First, simpler models are easier to deploy, and deploying your model early allows you to validate that your prediction pipeline is consistent with your training pipeline. Second, starting with something simple and adding more complex components step-by-step makes it easier to understand your model and debug it. Third, the simplest model serves as a baseline to which you can compare your more complex models.\n\n\nThe more components a model has, the more things that can go wrong, and the harder it is to figure out which goes wrong.\n\n\nOverfit a single batch After you have a simple implementation of your model, try to overfit a small amount of training data and run evaluation on the same data to make sure that it gets to the smallest possible loss. If it’s for image recognition, overfit on 10 images and see if you can get the accuracy to be 100%, or if it’s for machine translation, overfit on 100 sentence pairs and see if you can get to a BLEU score of near 100. If it can’t overfit a small amount of data, there might be something wrong with your implementation.\n\n\nEvaluation metrics, by themselves, mean little. When evaluating your model, it’s essential to know the baseline you’re evaluating it against. The exact baselines should vary from one use case to another, but here are the five baselines that might be useful across use cases:\n\n\nRandom baseline If our model just predicts at random, what’s the expected performance? The predictions are generated at random following a specific distribution, which can be the uniform distribution or the task’s label distribution.\n\n\nSimple heuristic Forget ML. If you just make predictions based on simple heuristics, what performance would you expect? For example, if you want to build a ranking system to rank items on a user’s newsfeed with the goal of getting that user to spend more time on the newsfeed, how much time would a user spend if you just rank all the items in reverse chronological order, showing the latest one first?\n\n\nZero rule baseline The zero rule baseline is a special case of the simple heuristic baseline when your baseline model always predicts the most common class.\n\n\nAndrew Ng has a great lecture where he explains that if a learning algorithm suffers from high bias, getting more training data by itself won’t help much. Whereas if a learning algorithm suffers from high variance, getting more training data is likely to help.\n\n\nThe process of generating predictions is called inference. We’ll continue with where the\n\n\nFor example, the compute primitive of CPUs used to be a number (scalar) and the compute primitive of GPUs used to be a one-dimensional vector, whereas the compute primitive of TPUs is a two-dimensional vector (tensor).\n\n\nFor readers interested in learning how to make ML systems reliable from the software engineering perspective, I highly recommend the book Reliable Machine Learning,\n\n\nIn the section “Natural Labels”, we discussed a feedback loop as the time it takes from when a prediction is shown until the time feedback on the prediction is provided.\n\n\nA degenerate feedback loop can happen when the predictions themselves influence the feedback, which, in turn, influences the next iteration of the model. More formally, a degenerate feedback loop is created when a system’s outputs are used to generate the system’s future inputs, which, in turn, influence the system’s future outputs.\n\n\nTo make this concrete, imagine you build a system to recommend to users songs that they might like. The songs that are ranked high by the system are shown first to users. Because they are shown first, users click on them more, which makes the system more confident that these recommendations are good.\n\n\nThis type of scenario is incredibly common in production, and it’s heavily researched. It goes by many different names, including “exposure bias,” “popularity bias,” “filter bubbles,” and sometimes “echo chambers.”\n\n\nWhile data distribution shift is often used interchangeably with concept drift and covariate shift and occasionally label shift, these are three distinct subtypes of data shift.\n\n\nCovariate shift When P(X) changes but P(Y|X) remains the same. This refers to the first decomposition of the joint distribution. Label shift When P(Y) changes but P(X|Y) remains the same. This refers to the second decomposition of the joint distribution. Concept drift When P(Y|X) changes but P(X) remains the same. This refers to the first decomposition of the joint distribution.\n\n\nThe first step of feature monitoring is feature validation: ensuring that your features follow an expected schema. The expected schemas are usually generated from training data or from common sense. If these expectations are violated in production, there might be a shift in the underlying distribution.\n\n\nExcessive metrics on a dashboard can also be counterproductive, a phenomenon known as dashboard rot. It’s important to pick the right metrics or abstract out lower-level metrics to compute higher-level signals that make better sense for your specific tasks.\n\n\nTo understand failures of ML systems, we differentiated between two types of failures: software systems failures (failures that also happen to non-ML systems) and ML-specific failures. Even though the majority of ML failures today are non-ML-specific, as tooling and infrastructure around MLOps matures, this might change.\n\n\nFirst, if your model is a neural network, learning with every incoming sample makes it susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the tendency of a neural network to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information.\n\n\nThe updated model shouldn’t be deployed until it’s been evaluated. This means that you shouldn’t make changes to the existing model directly. Instead, you create a replica of the existing model and update this replica on new data, and only replace the existing model with the updated replica if the updated replica proves to be better. The existing model is called the champion model, and the updated replica, the challenger.\n\n\nMost companies do stateless retraining—the model is trained from scratch each time. Continual learning means also allowing stateful training—the model continues training on new data.\n\n\nMost companies do stateless retraining—the model is trained from scratch each time. Continual learning means also allowing stateful training—the model continues training on new data.2 Stateful training is also known as fine-tuning or incremental learning.\n\n\nOne beautiful property that is often overlooked is that with stateful training, it might be possible to avoid storing data altogether.\n\n\nModel iteration A new feature is added to an existing model architecture or the model architecture is changed. Data iteration The model architecture and features remain the same, but you refresh this model with new data.\n\n\nThe first use case of continual learning is to combat data distribution shifts, especially when the shifts happen suddenly. Imagine you’re building a model to determine the prices for a ride-sharing service like Lyft.6 Historically, the ride demand on a Thursday evening in this particular neighborhood is slow, so the model predicts low ride prices, which makes it less appealing for drivers to get on the road. However, on this Thursday evening, there’s a big event in the neighborhood, and suddenly the ride demand surges.\n\n\nTikTok, for example, has successfully applied continual learning to adapt their recommender system to each user within minutes. You download the app and, after a few videos, TikTok’s algorithms are able to predict with high accuracy what you want to watch next. I don’t think everyone should try to build something as addictive as TikTok, but it’s proof that continual learning can unlock powerful predictive potential.\n\n\nThe best candidates for continual learning are tasks where you can get natural labels with short feedback loops. Examples of these tasks are dynamic pricing (based on estimated demand and availability),\n\n\nIt’s much easier to adapt models like neural networks than matrix-based and tree-based models to the continual learning paradigm.\n\n\nThe second factor is the availability and accessibility of your data. Do you need to gather data yourself into your data warehouse? Will you have to join data from multiple organizations? Do you need to extract a lot of features from scratch? Will you also need to label your data? The more questions you answer yes to, the more time it will take to set up this script. Stefan Krawczyk, ML/data platform manager at Stitch Fix, commented that he suspects most people’s time might be spent here.\n\n\nContextual bandits are also called “one-shot” reinforcement learning problems. In reinforcement learning, you might need to take a series of actions before seeing the rewards. In contextual bandits, you can get bandit feedback right away after an action—\n\n\nYou have time to set up only one piece of infrastructure well, make it the development environment for data scientists.” Because the dev environment is where engineers work, improvements in the dev environment translate directly into improvements in engineering productivity.\n\n\n“Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix,” Netflix included a list of infrastructure tools that can be used to make notebooks even more powerful. The list includes: Papermill For spawning multiple notebooks with different parameter sets—such as when you want to run different experiments with different sets of parameters and execute them concurrently. It can also help summarize metrics from a collection of notebooks. Commuter A notebook hub for viewing, finding, and sharing notebooks within an organization.\n\n\nAccording to Frederick P. Brooks, “What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Feature-Engineering-for-Machine-Learning":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Feature-Engineering-for-Machine-Learning","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Feature Engineering for Machine Learning.md","title":"Feature Engineering for Machine Learning","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","data-science","machine-learning/feature-engineering"],"content":"Feature Engineering for Machine Learning\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about how to make features for machine learning models and implement them into models.

However, this comes at a cost. Theoretically, with k unique words, there could be k2 unique 2-grams (also called bigrams).\n\n\nHypothesis testing is a way to boil noisy data down to “yes” or “no” answers. It involves modeling the data as samples drawn from random distributions.\n\n\nKhan Academy. “Hypothesis Testing and p-Values.” Retrieved from https:// www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/statistics-inferential/hypothesis-testing/v/ hypothesis-testing-and-p-values.\n\n\nTf-idf is a simple twist on the bag-of-words approach.

Due to its simplicity, it’s often a good first classifier to try.\n\n\nLogistic regression is relatively robust (or insensitive) to hyperparameter settings.\n\n\nA categorical variable, as the name suggests, is used to represent categories or labels. For instance, a categorical variable could represent major cities in the world, the four seasons in a year, or the industry (oil, travel, technology) of a company.\n\n\nHowever, unlike other numeric variables, the values of a catego‐ rical variable cannot be ordered with respect to one another. (Oil is neither greater than nor less than travel as an industry type.) They are called nonordinal.\n\n\nA simple question can serve as litmus test for whether something should be a catego‐ rical variable: “Does it matter how different two values are, or only that they are dif‐ ferent?”\n\n\nThe problem with one-hot encoding is that it allows for k degrees of freedom, while the variable itself needs only k–1. Dummy coding2 removes the extra degree of free‐ dom by using only k–1 features in the representation (see Table 5-2). One feature is thrown under the bus and represented by the vector of all zeros. This is known as the reference category.\n\n\nOne-hot encoding is redundant, which allows for multiple valid mod‐ els for the same problem. The nonuniqueness is sometimes problematic for interpre‐ tation, but the advantage is that each feature clearly corresponds to a category. Moreover, missing data can be encoded as the all-zeros vector, and the output should be the overall mean of the target variable.\n\n\nDummy coding and effect coding are not redundant. They give rise to unique and interpretable models. The downside of dummy coding is that it cannot easily handle missing data, since the all-zeros vector is already mapped to the reference category. It also encodes the effect of each category relative to the reference category, which may look strange.\n\n\nAll three encoding techniques break down when the number of categories becomes very large. Different strategies are needed to handle extremely large categorical variables.\n\n\nDo nothing fancy with the encoding. Use a simple model that is cheap to train.

In other words, instead of encoding the identity of the categorical value, we compute the association statistics between that value and the target that we wish to predict. For those familiar with naive Bayes classifiers, this statistic should ring a bell, because it is the conditional probability of the class under the assumption that all features are independent.\n\n\nOne way to deal with this is through back-off, a simple technique that accumulates the counts of all rare categories in a special bin (see Figure 5-3). If the count is greater than a certain threshold, then the category gets its own count statistics. Otherwise, we use the statistics from the back-off bin.\n\n\nNow we will take a close look at the topic of feature dimen‐ sionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA).\n\n\nThis concludes the discussion of PCA.

It goes through the different aspects of classifying customers and making cohorts of customers. It also delves into the problem of understanding churn and the likelihood of churn.\n🎨 Impressions\nThere are no easy ways of reducing churn. It will take a lot of effort.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nCustomer churn (cancelations) and engagement are life-and-death issues for every company that offers an online product or service.\n\n\nSuch services are often sold by subscription, but your organization does not need to sell subscriptions in order to take advantage of this book. All you need is a product with repeat customers or users and a desire to keep them coming back.\n\n\nChurn—When a customer quits using a service or cancels their subscription.\n\n\nThe word churn originated with the term churn rate, which refers to the proportion of customers departing in a given period, as we will discuss in more detail later.\n\n\nCustomer retention—Keeping customers using a service and renewing their subscriptions (if there are subscriptions). Customer retention is the opposite of churn.\n\n\nSaving churns, increasing engagement, and upsells are all important goals for services with repeated customer interactions.\n\n\nChurn measurement—Uses subscription data to identify churns and create churn metrics. The churn rate is an example of a churn metric. The subscription database also allows identification of customers who churned and who renewed and exactly when they did; this data is needed for further analysis.\n\n\nBehavioral measurement—Uses the event data warehouse to create behavioral metrics that summarize the events pertaining to each subscriber. Creating behavioral metrics is a crucial step that allows the events in the data warehouse to be interpreted.\n\n\nChurn analysis—Uses behavioral metrics for identified churns and renewals. The churn analysis identifies which subscriber behaviors are predictive of renewal and which are predictive of churn and can create a churn risk prediction for every subscriber.\n\n\nThere are some general principles for churn-reducing interventions, but these require customization for each product’s circumstances.\n\n\nThe bad news is that people are (mostly) rational and self-interested, and your customers already know your product.\n\n\nTo reduce churn, you need to increase value, but doing so is harder than getting people to sign up in the first place. Because your customers already know what the service is like, promises made by marketing or sales representatives won’t get much traction.\n\n\nIf a silver bullet means a low cost and reliable method, there are no silver bullets to reduce churn!\n\n\nPrice reduction is a “diamond bullet” against churn: it always works, but you can’t afford it.\n\n\nMost services consider down sells just another form of churn.\n\n\nChurn-reduction efforts are at risk of miscommunication and lack of coordination between the multiple teams involved.\n\n\nAlso, in a typical situation, the data person can’t do anything to reduce churn on their own. Reducing churn depends on actions taken by specialists in different parts of the business, not by a person who is wrangling the data. These coworkers are diverse, and I will refer to them as the businesspeople for lack of a better term. I’m not implying that the data person is not part of the business; but data people usually have no direct responsibility for concrete business outcomes (like revenue), whereas the people in those other roles usually do.\n\n\nThe data person’s goal is to make businesspeople more effective at churn-reducing interventions.\n\n\nThe best way to make data into a weapon in the fight against churn is to use the data to produce effective customer measurements and get those measurements into the hands of the business’s churn fighters.\n\n\nCustomer metric—Any measurement you make on all customers individually.\n\n\nFor a customer metric to be great for fighting churn, it should have the following characteristics: (1) easily understood by the business; (2) clearly associated with churn and retention, so it is obvious what a healthy customer looks like; (3) segments customers in a way that’s useful for targeted interventions that increase engagement; and (4) useful to multiple functions of the business (product, marketing, support, etc.).\n\n\nThe main deliverable to the business from the data analysis project is a set of customer metrics.\n\n\nTo succeed in this environment, the process of using the data must be parsimonious and agile. Parsimony means using the minimum amount of data and the fewest analytic steps required to get the job done. Agility means responding to change quickly and efficiently.\n\n\nYour goal is to deliver actionable knowledge to the businesspeople. Listen to them, and try to answer their questions first. Do not exhaustively test every hypothesis or evaluation metric.\n\n\nUser inactivity can be seen as churn for the free tier of a freemium service, and the same applies for apps or ad-supported products with no explicit subscription.\n\n\nEvent—In the context of fighting churn, any user interaction or result that the data warehouse tracks. Events are time-stamped and pertain to a single account or user.\n\n\nConsequently, a cancellation event does not necessarily mean a churn will occur, because the customer still might re-sign before much time has passed.\n\n\nThe bottom line is that the most important events are those that are closest to the customer achieving the goal or purpose of the service.\n\n\nMonthly recurring revenue (MRR) is a standard metric for calculating the amount a customer pays to use a subscription service: it is the recurring amount a customer pays each month to use a service, but not including any setup fees or irregular charges. (I will say more about MRR and how to calculate it in chapter 3.) The amount customers pay can also be analyzed with a metric cohort approach to look for a relationship with churn, which is shown for Versature\n\n\nChurn also applies to all products and services where customers or users repeatedly interact with the product over long periods of time, whether or not there is a formal subscription or any form of payment.\n\n\n– Useful in multiple functions of the business (i.e., product, marketing, support, and so on\n\n\nRetention rate can be easily calculated from the churn rate and vice versa. Which measurement you look at is a matter of preference.\n\n\nNet retention is known as net because it combines the effects of churns, upsells, and down sells.\n\n\nOne important difference between churn based on subscriptions and churn based on activity is that activity-based churn requires a wait time for every customer to know whether they have churned. On a subscription, you know a churn is a churn the day after the subscription ends without a replacement; but for users on a system without a subscription, you never know if an event is the last event defining a churn until some time later.\n\n\nYou can calculate the churn rate on nonsubscription products based on the recency of activity.\n\n\nTo convert monthly churn rate to annual, use the fact that annual retention is monthly retention to the twelfth power, and retention is one minus churn.\n\n\nMeasuring churn over a time window that is different from the typical subscription length (or typical customer active lifetime) can result in errors in the churn rate.\n\n\nSeasonality—Variations that occur at particular times of the year.\n\n\nMost human behaviors follow weekly cycles. Consequently, for metrics using a period of one month or less, it is best to measure using time windows that are multiples of seven days.\n\n\nFor products where a typical customer lifetime is a few months or less, you may need to update metrics every day. But for products where a customer’s typical lifetime is several months or more, it is usually adequate to calculate metrics once a week.\n\n\nWhen you quality-check metric results, always use methods that make it obvious when results are not produced in addition to when bad results are produced. That means picking the dates to check independently from the data being checked.\n\n\nYour knowledge of the business is not good enough to judge whether the observed counts of events per month is reasonable, then you must get help from someone in your organization who does. Do this before you spend a lot of time calculating behavioral metrics and doing churn analysis.\n\n\nIt’s easy to detect anomalies visually—arguably more effective than almost any algorithm. The other reason I recommend the manual approach is that it’s a good way to get to know your data.\n\n\nI refer to the length of time an account has been a customer as the account tenure rather than something along the lines of account age because age can be confused with the actual age of a person (or company).\n\n\nAccount tenure is important in analyzing churn because it can relate to churn in significant ways: there can be particular points in the customer life cycle when churn is most (or least) likely, or churn can generally decrease (or increase) with longer account tenure.\n\n\nAccount tenure measures the length of time for which there is a continuous subscription for a single account through one or more subscriptions that can overlap or that can include short gaps.\n\n\nAccount tenure—The length of time a customer uses a product on their current, uninterrupted sequence of subscriptions or their current uninterrupted period of activity, possibly including a relatively short time gap between subscriptions or activity.\n\n\nThe terminology of subscription business management software systems, each individual sale of some number of units for a specific time period is often referred to as a charge segment, a rate plan charge, or just a charge.\n\n\nCharge segment—A single recurring contract for a certain quantity of some units. Also referred to as a rate plan charge or just a charge.\n\n\nBilling period—Measures how often the customer is billed.\n\n\nIt is easier to convince customers to stay before they churn than to sign up anew after they churn. The period before churn, therefore, is the focus of the analysis.\n\n\nObserve customers before they churn. Right! I call this observing customers with a lead time in making the observation, which means making the observations before the thing you are really interested in (the renewal or churn).\n\n\nThe goal of the analysis is to identify and understand customers who are still making up their minds about churn, because that is when you have the best chance of influencing them.\n\n\nActive period—A span of time when a subscriber has at least one active subscription.\n\n\nIf an account is not in an active period, the end of the last active period was a churn.\n\n\nActive period derived from events—A span of time when a user has had at least one event. There can be gaps between events up to the limit, without disrupting the active period. The definition of active periods from events is similar to the definition of active periods from multiple subscriptions\n\n\nActive week —A seven-day period when an account has at least one event.\n\n\nIn the database table, though, the data is normalized so the values of all metrics are in a single column, and another column identifies which metrics are on a given row. In the database, the behavioral snapshot for a single account on a single date is spread over many rows. This is often referred to as wide data versus tall data. An analytic dataset is wide because it has many columns for all the different variables; a database table is tall because the data is all stacked up in one column. Converting data from tall to wide is often known as flattening the data, and that is what you must do to create the churn dataset. (It is also referred to as pivoting the data by those who have seen this done with the Pivot function in a spreadsheet.\n\n\nSegmentation—Selecting a set of customers according to a set of criteria.\n\n\nChurn analysis dataset is a table of behavioral snapshots of customers, including both customers who churned and customers who did not churn.\n\n\nChurn leading indicators are behaviors that suggest a high likelihood of churn at a time when the customer has not yet made up their mind. Churn leading indicators are usually the focus in fighting churn.\n\n\nChurn lagging indicators are behaviors that customers often engage in after they have already decided to churn. Churn lagging behaviors are usually not the underlying cause of churn.\n\n\nIf you need to use statistics to understand your experiment, then you ought to have done a better experiment\n\n\n—Ernest Rutherford,\n\n\n☐ A churn cohort analysis is a comparison of churn rates in different metric cohorts.\n\n\nThe fact that churn rates fall with behavior and then level off is both useful and a problem. It’s useful because it’s easy to identify a healthy level for the metric: the level where churn rates stop declining. It’s a problem because after a certain point, that metric no longer helps you understand churn or segment customers based on churn risk.\n\n\nSkew A statistical measure of how symmetric or lopsided the distribution of the metric is. This  kind of lopsidedness occurs in the cohort analyses earlier in this chapter. If the skew is zero, the low and high values are symmetrically distributed around the mean. If the skew is positive, there are more observations of the metric that are higher than the mean than observations that are smaller than the mean. If the skew is negative, the opposite is true: more observations are smaller than the mean than those that are greater than the mean.\n\n\nGenerally, skews below 3 or 4 are not significant, but metrics with skews of 5 or greater are significantly skewed.\n\n\nCustomers who don’t have to pay may be on temporary free trials, or they may be in some special category of customers, like partners who have permanent free use of the product. You might have a similar situation when some customers pay a nominal amount that is much less than what usual customers pay. The problem with nonpaying (or low-paying) customers is that they tend not to churn because the product doesn’t cost them anything, but they don’t necessarily use the product much.\n\n\nIf you have customers who pay and some who do not, you should remove the nonpaying customers before trying to do cohort analysis or the other analyses described in later chapters.\n\n\nA disengaging behavior is a customer behavior that leads to an increased risk of churn the more often it is performed.\n\n\nDisengaging behaviors usually show a weak relationship with increasing churn—typically less than the reduction in churn that comes from using the product even a small amount.\n\n\nYou usually don’t intervene to reduce churn with the most disengaged customers.\n\n\nIt is also common to use interventions (such as emails, calls, or training) to target the customers at some intermediate level of risk.\n\n\nYou usually don’t intervene to reduce churn with the most disengaged customers.  The reasoning is that the highest-risk (lowest-use) customers can be so disengaged that intervention will have no effect and would be wasted. This consideration is most important when intervention has a cost associated with it or when you think that unwanted communication might disengage customers further.\n\n\nMetric cohort analysis usually shows that customers who use a product more churn less.\n\n\nEach cohort should have at least 200 to 300 observations, and preferably thousands. If you don’t have a lot of observations for your customers, use fewer cohorts.\n\n\nMetric scores are often more correlated than the underlying metrics on their natural scale, especially when the metrics are heavily skewed. This is another important reason for using metric scores in your analysis.\n\n\nBecause each metric score measures the position of the customer with respect to the average, it is okay to average together scores of different types of metrics.\n\n\nFor correlated metrics, it is better to analyze churn in cohorts using the average score in place of individual metrics.\n\n\nHierarchical clustering is a greedy, agglomerative clustering algorithm: ☐ Agglomerative means the algorithm works by combining similar items in a bottomup manner. Groups are formed starting from just two similar elements, and more elements are added to form larger groups of similar items as the algorithm progresses. ☐ Greedy means that the algorithm works by picking the two elements that appear most similar, and after those two are grouped, the next most similar item is grouped at each stage. ☐ Hierarchical in this context refers to the fact that greedy agglomeration implies a structure or hierarchy between the items. There are the two most similar items, and after that, there is the next most similar, and so on.\n\n\nYour job is to shield your business colleagues from as much of the jargon as possible. So do not try to impress them with technical terms! Rather, try to simplify things to a common language.\n\n\nA ratio metric is a metric that is made by taking the ratio of the values of two other metrics. Each value of the new metric is a value of one metric divided by the value of another metric.\n\n\nPercentage of total metrics reveals the relative balance between a set of closely related, highly correlated activities.\n\n\nWhen two metrics are two parts of a whole, a percentage ratio is more interpretable than a simple ratio.\n\n\nFormula, which I call the fat-tails formula because it transforms a metric into a score when there are extreme outliers in both negative and positive directions. The condition of having both positive and negative extreme values is called fat tails because tails refer to the extremes of the distribution.\n\n\nAnother test for fat-tailed metrics is to check for a high value on the statistic called kurtosis, a measurement designed to detect fat-tailed distributions. I am omitting it for simplicity because in churn cases, the fat-tailed metrics are also skewed.\n\n\nDo not confuse the time period over which you make an average behavioral measurement with the time period with which you choose to describe the behavior. The time periods don’t have to be the same. You can describe all your metrics on one time scale, even if the metrics are measured over different-length time windows.\n\n\nDo not make estimates for one-month averages until you’ve observed at least one week of behavior, and preferably two.\n\n\nTo understand churn, you should use average metrics with longer observation periods than the description periods and scaling to make comparable estimates of the averages for new accounts. Simple count metrics should be used only to measure use of a contracted quantity, in which case the exact count in the contract period matters.\n\n\nThe first thing to understand about multiuser products is that it’s still best to understand churn at the subscription or account level because all the users share one subscription; if the subscription is not renewed, all the users churn together.\n\n\nChurn does not occur when individual users become inactive on a multiuser product.\n\n\nLicense utilization is a metric that is defined as the ratio of the number of users to the maximum number of allowed users. Sometimes, the number of users is measured by creation of user accounts, but for churn, I prefer to measure the actual or active license use by making a ratio of the active users divided by the number of licensed users.\n\n\nAn interaction metric is the product (multiplication) of two other metrics.\n\n\nAn interaction term is a bit like an and operation in computer science. If you have a computer science background, you may be thinking that you could make metrics with a Boolean operation like “Assign a 1 when two metrics are both above a certain level.” You can think of a multiplicative interaction as being a more nuanced alternative. An interaction isn’t just 0 or 1 when both metrics are high; it measures how high both metrics are as a real value. Interaction terms also have interesting statistical properties when applied to scores or metrics that can take negative values, because when either one metric or the other is negative, the interaction measurement takes on a negative value.\n\n\nIf interaction measurements are so interesting and widely used in statistics, you may be wondering why I don’t recommend them for churn analysis. The simple answer is that no one in the business world understands interaction terms, but ratios are easy to understand.\n\n\nA spurious relationship between a metric and an outcome is a relationship that occurred due to random chance, not due to a repeatable, causal relationship. As a result, the relationship is not likely to recur.\n\n\nYou mainly consider ratio metrics that make intuitive sense to someone in the business.\n\n\nA churn probability forecast for a customer is a prediction that if you have a cohort of customers with that same forecast, you expect the percentage given by the probability to churn. A churn probability forecast never tells you whether a single customer definitively will or won’t churn.\n\n\nEngagement is a state of involvement and commitment. For this discussion, involvement means use of the product, and commitment means likelihood of renewal. It makes sense that more engagement should lead to a higher chance of retention. For now, don’t worry that engagement itself is a subjective state.\n\n\nCustomer engagement cannot be measured directly, but you can estimate it from customer metrics for the purpose of predicting churn probability by matching the observed churn with the S curve.\n\n\nCustomer engagement is estimated from a model in which engagement weights are multiplied by the scores for each metric and then added together.\n\n\nThe retention impact of a metric or group of metrics is the difference that it makes to the retention probability for a customer to be one standard deviation above the average in this metric, assuming that all the other metrics are exactly average.\n\n\nGrouping correlated metrics helps reduce information overload when there are many metrics in regression analysis.\n\n\nCalibration refers to the degree of correspondence between the estimated probabilities of churn and retention produced by the model and the actual churn experienced by the customers.\n\n\nThe most important check of calibration is that the average churn rate predicted by the model should match the churn rate in the data.\n\n\nA fat tail in the churn probability distribution is when the number of customers with higher churn probabilities is large enough to show up clearly in the histogram.\n\n\nA spiked tail in the churn probability distribution is when there are certain ranges of churn probabilities in the tail with abnormally high numbers of customers. Sometimes, these numbers are related to identifiable behaviors such as lacking a particular behavior or having monthly versus annual billing.\n\n\nA multipeak distribution is another way to describe this type of distribution, although you usually describe the churn probability distribution as multipeak only when two or more peaks in the histogram shape have similar height. No case study example of this type was available.\n\n\nA thin tail is when most of the customers are packed in a narrow probability range, but there is a small number of customers with much higher churn probability. In a thin tail, the number is so small that these customers are not visible in the histogram;\n\n\nForecasts for extreme outliers can cause confusion and doubt for businesspeople when you present the model results to them.\n\n\nOutlier clipping means reducing the value of extreme outliers so that they are still near the high (or low) end of possible values but not quite as extreme.\n\n\nCustomer lifetime value is the amount you expect a customer to be worth to your business, including the revenue and costs you foresee, over the customer’s entire lifetime. This forecast includes future payments.\n\n\nCustomer acquisition cost (CAC) is the total amount spent on marketing and sales per customer acquired. CAC usually depends on the channel or campaign through which the customer was acquired.\n\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is the total amount spent to maintain the service for existing customers, including things like cloud computing costs and the cost of providing customer support. COGS can depend on the type of customer.\n\n\nFuture lifetime value (FLV) is the sum of the recurring payments and maintenance costs, at any time after the first period.\n\n\nFLV emphasizes the future view of CLV for retention, which ignores acquisition and past revenue and costs.\n\n\nThe standard accuracy measurement is inappropriate for churn because churn is rare, so the measurement can be gamed by predicting that no one will churn. More generally, accuracy on churned customers makes only a small contribution to the measurement.\n\n\n0.6–0.7 Healthy range for weakly predictable churn. 0.7–0.8 Healthy range for highly predictable churn.\n\n\n0.8–0.85 Extremely predictable churn. This result is suspicious for a consumer product and usually is possible only for a business product with informative events and advanced metrics. &gt; 0.85 Something probably is wrong. Normally, churn is not this predictable, even for business products.\n\n\nThe top decile lift of a predictive churn model is the ratio of the churn rate in the top decile of customers predicted to be most at risk to the overall churn rate.\n\n\nLift is the relative increase in responses due to some treatment relative to the baseline.\n\n\nThe same reasoning applies to churn forecasting. If your market, product, or competition changes during the time spanned by your dataset, it might be hard to forecast churn accurately in the time after the change. If you shuffle the data, you can get a different result than you would have if you had been forecasting for your customers at that time.\n\n\nAlthough you may optimistically think you would refit a new model every month, in reality, many companies “set it and forget it.” Even if you are very determined, you will probably refit your own model only a few times a year after you finish the initial development.\n\n\nA lookahead bias is an error that occurs when you estimate accuracy in a historical simulation using information that would not be available in real time for forecasting on active customers.\n\n\nBackdated records for events, subscriptions, or other customer data can lead to lookahead bias in your forecasts and cause the backtest to appear more accurate than what you would achieve in real-time forecasting.\n\n\nCross-validation is the process of optimizing a forecasting model by comparing the accuracy and other characteristics of models created with different parameters.\n\n\nCross-validation is a common task in data science and machine learning, and what the CV means in the GridSearchCV object you were introduced to earlier. The GridSearch part of the name refers to the fact that a typical cross-validation works on a sequence or multiple sequences of parameters. If there were two parameters, each with its own sequence of values, the combinations of those two sequences would define a grid. In fact, there can be any number of parameters.\n\n\nA machine learning model is any predictive algorithm that has the following two characteristics: (1) the algorithm learns to make the prediction by processing sample data (as compared with making predictions with rules set by a human programmer), and (2) the algorithm is not the regression algorithm.\n\n\nA decision tree is an algorithm for predicting an outcome (such as a customer’s churning or not churning) that consists of a binary tree made up of rules or tests.\n\n\nA random forest is an algorithm for predicting an outcome such as a customer’s churning by randomly generating a large set of decision trees (a forest). All the trees try to predict the same outcome, but each does so according to a different set of learned rules. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of the forest.\n\n\nBoosting is a machine learning ensemble in which the ensemble members are added so that they correct the errors of the existing ensemble.\n\n\nRather than randomly adding decision trees, as in a random forest, you create each new tree in a boosting ensemble to correct wrong answers made by the existing ensemble, rather than repredicting on the correct examples. Internal to the boosting algorithm, successive trees are generated to correct the observations that were not correctly classified by earlier trees. Also, the weight assigned to successive trees in the vote is made to best correct the mistakes, not an equal vote like in random forests. These improvements make boosted forests of decisions trees more accurate than a truly random forest of decision trees.\n\n\nState-of-the-art machine learning models have so many parameters that the only way to make sure you pick the best values is to cross-validate a large number of them. That is, you test a sequence of plausible values for each parameter and choose the ones that have the best values on a crossvalidation test.\n\n\nXGBoost doesn’t necessarily give calibrated churn probability forecasts. The XGBoost model is optimized for accuracy as measured by the classification of churns, not matching observed churn rates.\n\n\nDemographics are facts about individual customers, and firmographics are facts about customers that are companies (firms).\n\n\nDemographics and firmographics generally are unchanging facts about the customer or facts that change only rarely. Demographics and firmographics do not include product use or subscription-derived metrics, but they can include facts about how the customer signed up or about the hardware a customer uses to access an online service.\n\n\nChannel (short for the sales channel)—The sales channel refers to how the customer found the product and signed up. All users sign up through one method, so the channel is a required field with no null values in the social network simulation.\n\n\nDo not overthink your category groups or spend too much time on them. Remember the need for agility in your analysis. Do something that gives you a manageable result for a first pass, take feedback from your business colleagues, and iterate from there.\n\n\nDemographic categories are often related to churn and engagement because customers from different demographics behave differently. But if you use detailed behavioral metrics, you will usually find that behaviors are the underlying drivers of retention in a predictive forecast.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Machine Learning Design Patterns.md","title":"Machine Learning Design Patterns","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","machine-learning","design-patterns","data-science"],"content":"Machine Learning Design Patterns\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about machine learning design patterns and discussions around those—concepts in machine learning for this. And therefore, it is a good reminder of the concepts and core tenants of machine learning.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a bit of a harder read than Designing Machine Learning Systems, which is a bit harder to grasp and not as “profound” knowledge. Therefore, it is more difficult for me to give it a very strong recommendation.  Nevertheless, it is important to say that this is a good book.  When reading through the quotes, I realize that there were a lot of good insights from the book.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAt its core, machine learning is a process of building models that learn from data.\n\n\nGradient descent optimizers require more steps to converge as the curvature of the loss function increases. This is because the derivatives of features with larger relative magnitudes will tend to be larger as well, and so lead to abnormal weight updates. The abnormally large weight updates will require more steps to converge and thereby increase the computation load.\n\n\n“Centering” the data to lie in the [–1, 1] range makes the error function more spherical. Therefore, models trained with transformed data tend to converge faster and are, therefore faster/cheaper to train. In addition, the [–1, 1] range offers the highest floating point precision.\n\n\nThis is called dummy coding. Because dummy coding is a more compact representation, it is preferred in statistical models that perform better when the inputs are linearly independent.  Modern machine learning algorithms, though, don’t require their inputs to be linearly independent and use methods such as L1 regularization to prune redundant inputs. The additional degree of freedom allows the framework to transparently handle a missing input in production as all zeros:\n\n\nThe categorical variables have high cardinality. Instead of having feature vectors with three languages or seven days, we have feature vectors whose length is in the thousands to millions.\n\n\nAfter the model is placed into production, new hospitals might be built and new physicians hired. The model will be unable to make predictions for these, and so a separate serving infrastructure will be required to handle such cold-start problems.\n\n\nEven with simple representations like one-hot encoding, it is worth anticipating the cold-start problem and explicitly reserving all zeros for out-of-vocabulary inputs.\n\n\nEven if an airport with a handful of flights is not part of the training dataset, its hashed feature value will be in the range [0–9]. Therefore, there is no resilience problem during serving—the unknown airport will get the predictions corresponding with other airports in the hash bucket. The model will not error out.\n\n\nIt is true that hashing is lossy—since we have 347 airports, an average of 35 airports will get the same hash bucket code if we hash it into 10 buckets. When the alternative is to discard the variable because it is too wide, though, a lossy encoding is an acceptable compromise.\n\n\nMost design patterns involve some kind of a trade-off, and the Hashed Feature design pattern is no exception. The key trade-off here is that we lose model accuracy.\n\n\nDo not choose Hashed Feature if you know the vocabulary beforehand, if the vocabulary size is relatively small (in the thousands is acceptable for a dataset with millions of examples), and if a cold start is not a concern.\n\n\nEmbeddings are a learnable data representation that maps high-cardinality data into a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the information relevant to the learning problem is preserved.\n\n\nA feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by concatenating two or more categorical features in order to capture the interaction between them.\n\n\nFor this reason, it is advisable to pair feature crosses with L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity of features, or L2 regularization, which limits overfitting.\n\n\nThis type of model approach is also useful when the numerical representation has an intuitive interpretation; for example, a latitude and longitude pair can be used instead of urban area predictions.\n\n\nFor examples like this one, where the goal is primarily to suggest possible tags with less emphasis on getting the tag exactly right, a typical rule of thumb is to use n_specific_tag / n_total_examples as a threshold for each class.\n\n\nThis approach is called one versus rest. In the case of the Stack Overflow example where we want to tag questions as TensorFlow, Python, and pandas, we’d train an individual classifier for each of these three tags: Python or not, TensorFlow or not, and so forth.\n\n\nThe irreducible error is the inherent error in the model resulting from noise in the dataset, the framing of the problem, or bad training examples, like measurement errors or confounding factors. Just as the name implies, we can’t do much about irreducible error.\n\n\nThe other two, the bias and the variance, are referred to as the reducible error, and here is where we can influence our model’s performance. In short, the bias is the model’s inability to learn enough about the relationship between the model’s features and labels, while the variance captures the model’s inability to generalize on new, unseen examples. A model with high bias oversimplifies the relationship and is said to be underfit. A model with high variance has learned too much about the training data and is said to be overfit.\n\n\nThis also explains why bagging is typically less effective for more stable learners like k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes, linear models, or support vector machines (SVMs) since the size of the training set is reduced through bootstrapping.\n\n\nThe boosting algorithm works by iteratively improving the model to reduce the prediction error. Each new weak learner corrects for the mistakes of the previous prediction by modeling the residuals delta_i of each step. The final prediction is the sum of the outputs from the base learner and each of the successive weak learners,\n\n\nBy iteratively focusing on the hard-to-predict examples, boosting effectively decreases the bias of the resulting model.\n\n\nStacking can be thought of as an extension of simple model averaging where we train k models to completion on the training dataset, then average the results to determine a prediction. Simple model averaging is similar to bagging, but the models in the ensemble could be of different types, while for bagging, the models are of the same type.\n\n\nSplitting an ML problem is usually a bad idea, since an ML model can/should learn combinations of multiple factors.\n\n\nIn many classification situations, creating a neutral class can be helpful. For example, instead of training a binary classifier that outputs the probability of an event, train a three-class classifier that outputs disjoint probabilities for Yes, No, and Maybe. Disjoint here means that the classes do not overlap.\n\n\nThe Rebalancing design pattern provides various approaches for handling datasets that are inherently imbalanced. By this we mean datasets where one label makes up the majority of the dataset, leaving far fewer examples of other labels.\n\n\nPrecision measures the percentage of positive classifications that were correct out of all positive predictions made by the model. Conversely, recall measures the proportion of actual positive examples that were identified correctly by the model. The biggest difference between these two metrics is the denominator used to calculate them. For precision, the denominator is the total number of positive class predictions made by our model. For recall, it is the number of actual positive class examples present in our dataset.\n\n\nBy weighting classes, we tell our model to treat specific label classes with more importance during training.\n\n\nOverfitting can happen if the model complexity is higher than can be afforded by the size and coverage of the dataset.\n\n\nOne bit of intuition as to why this works comes from the Uniform Approximation Theorem of deep learning, which, loosely put, states that any function (and its derivatives) can be approximated by a neural network with at least one hidden layer and any “squashing” activation function, like sigmoid.\n\n\nThere is no noise, so the labels are accurate for all instances.  You have the complete dataset at your disposal (you have all the examples there are). In this case, overfitting becomes interpolating the dataset.\n\n\nIn addition, recent research indicates that double descent happens in a variety of machine learning problems, and therefore it is better to train longer rather than risk a suboptimal solution by stopping early. Two splits  Isn’t the advice in the regularization section in conflict with the advice in the previous sections on early stopping or checkpoint selection?\n\n\nA model that takes two weeks to train on GPUs can converge in hours on TPUs.\n\n\nFor example, as accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs, and so on) have gotten faster, I/O has become a significant bottleneck in ML training.\n\n\nBecause stateless components don’t have any state, they can be shared by multiple clients.\n\n\nThe solution to any problem in computer science is to add an extra level of indirection.\n\n\nThe Feature Store design pattern simplifies the management and reuse of features across projects by decoupling the feature creation process from the development of models using those features.\n\n\nOne of the key characteristics of operationalized models is automated workflow pipelines. The development stage of the ML life cycle is a multi-step process. Building pipelines to automate these steps enables more efficient workflows and repeatable processes that improve future model development, and allows for increased agility in solving problems that arise.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Engineering-with-MLflow":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Engineering-with-MLflow","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow.md","title":"Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","machine-learning/modeling","machine-learning/ml-engineering","ml-preprocessing","ml/frameworks"],"content":"Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIntroduction to ML flow package and how to use it. It is basically an advanded user guide to help with understanding and applying MLFlow for machine learning projects.\n🎨 Impressions\nI do not work that much with ML-Flow and to be honest I do not believe that it would be that advantageous to\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nMLflow is an open source platform for the machine learning (ML) life cycle, with a focus on reproducibility, training, and deployment.\n\n\nAs will be demonstrated, a non-trivial amount of code needs to be created in order to productionize and make sure that the preceding training code is usable and reliable. One of the main objectives of MLflow is to aid in the process of setting up ML systems and projects.\n\n\nThe mlflow.sklearn.autolog() instruction enables you to automatically log the experiment in the local directory.\n\n\n• Mlflow Models: A mechanism that deploys to different types of environments, both on-premises and in the cloud\n\n\nMlflow Model Registry: A module that handles the management of models in MLflow and its life cycle, including state\n\n\nThe mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, “model_random_forest”) method takes care of persisting the model upon training.

Success is basically whether the system is accurate, from a market direction perspective, more than 60% of the time – basically, the expected value of being better than the random baseline.\n\n\nThe output of the model will be used to provide the Rest API with a true orfalse value based on a defined threshold of accuracy on the classification.\n\n\nThe expected latency for this problem is under 1,000 milliseconds.\n\n\nHeuristics The simplest heuristic to solve this problem is using a random predictor for each input, with an equal probability of the market going up or down.\n\n\n• docker: A folder that encloses the Docker images of the different subsystems that our environment consists of.  • docker-compose.yml: A file that contains the orchestration of different services in our workbench environment—namely: Jupyter Notebooks, MLflow, and PostgreSQL to back MLflow. • docs: Contains relevant project documentation that we want persisted for the project.\n\n\n• requirements.txt: A requirements file to add libraries to the project. • src: A folder that encloses the source code of the project, to be updated in further phases of the project.  • tests: A folder that contains end-to-end testing for the code of the project.\n\n\nTox.ini: A templated file that controls the execution of unit tests.\n\n\nA good analogy of an MLflow model is that it’s a bit like a Dockerfile for a model, where you describe metadata of the model, and deployment tools upstream are able to interact with the model based on the specification.\n\n\nA feature store is a software layer on top of your data to abstract all the production and management processes for data by providing inference systems with an interface to retrieve a feature set that can be used for inference or training.\n\n\nFeast Architecture (retrieved from docs.feast.dev/\n\n\nThe Ray framework (docs.ray.io/en/master/) is a distributed platform that allows you to quickly scale the deployment infrastructure\n\n\nMonitoring is at the cornerstone of reliable ML systems able to consistently unlock the value of data and provide critical feedback for improvement.\n\n\nAWS CloudWatch provides a monitoring and observability solution.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Engineering":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Machine-Learning-Engineering","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Machine Learning Engineering.md","title":"Machine Learning Engineering","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","machine-learning/ml-engineering","machine-learning/feature-engineering","mlops"],"content":"Machine Learning Engineering\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the practical implementation of machine learning models. It goes through why machine learning should be used, how to implement it, and how to execute in all phasers of the machine learning life-cycle.\n🎨 Impressions\nI felt it, along with a lot of other books on machine learning engineering I have read suffers from being too “FAANG” or “Big Tech”, in which they have a lot of focus on metrics and processes that never materialize in 90 % of businesses. For example, the focus on model reproducibility is not something I have implemented a lot of times but never once has even a casual mention of a use case for this materialized. This is probably one of those things that have drifted from academia into business. As the book wants to highlight, it is about the practical implementation of machine learning to solve business problems, then it should try to limit the “Research Machine Learning” culture as much as possible within that book.\nIts focus on the why at the start of the book, and reasons for failure was something I quite liked and learned a lot from, this is something I will take with me.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n“The perfect project plan is possible if one first documents a list of all the unknowns.”\n\n\n“When you’re fundraising, it’s AI. When you’re hiring, it’s ML. When you’re implementing, it’s linear regression. When you’re debugging, it’s printf().” — Baron Schwartz\n\n\nIn other words, if you’re looking for opportunities to create innovative ML-based solutions to business problems, you want the discipline called Applied Machine Learning, not Machine Learning Research, so most books won’t suit your needs.\n\n\nI’ll put it in culinary terms:\n\nyou’ll need to figure out what’s worth cooking / what the objectives are (decision-making and product management)\nunderstand the suppliers and the customers (domain expertise and business acumen)\nhow to process ingredients at scale (data engineering and analysis)\nhow to try many diﬀerent ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (prototype phase ML engineering)\nhow to check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (statistics)\nhow to turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served eﬃciently (production phase ML engineering)\nhow to ensure that your dishes stay top notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered (reliability engineering\n\n\n\nIt promptly shatters any false sense of security you were tempted to have about building an AI system that is more “intelligent” than you are. (Um, no. Just no. )\n\n\nIn 2020, most organizations still spend between 31 and 90 days deploying one model, while 18 percent of companies are taking longer than 90 days — some spending more than a year productionizing\n\n\nThe main challenges organizations face when developing ML capabilities, such as model version control, reproducibility, and scaling, are rather engineering than scientific.\n\n\nalgorithmically training a statistical model based on that dataset.\n\n\nIn supervised learning, the problem of predicting a class is called classiﬁcation, while the problem of predicting a real number is called regression. The value that has to be predicted by a supervised model is called a target\n\n\nReinforcement learning is a subﬁeld of machine learning where the machine (called an agent) “lives’ ’ in an environment and is capable of perceiving the state of that environment as a vector of features. The machine can execute actions in non-terminal states. Diﬀerent actions bring diﬀerent rewards and could also move the machine to another state of the environment. A common goal of a reinforcement learning algorithm is to learn an optimal policy.\n\n\nyou can manually fill an exhaustive lookup table by providing the expected output for any input (that is, the number of possible input values is not too large, or getting outputs is fast and cheap).\n\n\nFinally, one of the most influential cost factors is the desired accuracy of the model. The machine learning project’s cost grows superlinearly with the accuracy requirement,\n\n\nwhat is the lowest accuracy level below which the model becomes impractical.\n\n\nAccording to various estimates made between 2017 and 2020, 74% to 87% of machine learning and advanced analytics projects fail or don’t reach production.\n\n\nAs of 2020, both data science and machine learning engineering are relatively new disciplines. There’s still no standard way to teach them. Most organizations don’t know how to hire experts in machine learning and how to compare them.\n\n\nThis results in a significant time spent by skilled data scientists on data labeling and labeling tool development. This is a major challenge for the eﬀective execution of an AI project.\n\n\nAs many as 76% of AI and data science teams label training data on their own, while 63% build their own labeling and annotation automation technology.\n\n\n*The impact of using machine learning is high when,\n\nmachine learning can replace a complex part in your engineering project, or\nthere’s a great beneﬁt in getting inexpensive (but probably imperfect) predictions.\n\n\n\n*The cost of the machine learning project is highly influenced by three factors:\n\nthe diﬃculty of the problem,\nthe cost of data, and\nthe needed model performance quality.\n\n\n\nOne way to make a more educated guess is to simplify the problem and solve a simpler one. The progress of a machine learning project is nonlinear.\n\n\nThere are two cultures of structuring a machine learning team, depending on the organization. One culture says that a machine learning team has to be composed of data analysts who collaborate closely with software engineers. In such a culture, a software engineer doesn’t need to have profound expertise in machine learning but has to understand the vocabulary of their fellow data analysts or scientists. According to the other culture, all engineers in a machine learning team must have a combination of machine learning and software engineering skills.\n\n\nLack of alignment between technical and business teams.\n\n\nyou used a learning algorithm incapable of training a complex enough model using the data you have.\n\n\nten times the number of trainable parameters (usually applied to neural networks).\n\n\nTypes of Bias\n\n\nSelection bias is the tendency to skew your choice of data sources to those that are easily available, convenient, and/or cost-effective.\n\nSelf-selection bias is a form of selection bias where you get the data from sources that “volunteered” to provide it. Most poll data has this type of bias.\nOmitted variable bias happens when your featurized data doesn’t have a feature necessary for accurate prediction. For example, let’s assume that you are working on a churn prediction model and you want to predict whether a customer cancels their subscription within six months. You train a model, and it’s accurate enough; however, several weeks after deployment you see many unexpected false negatives. You investigate the decreased model performance and discover a new competitor now oﬀers a very similar service for a lower price.\n*Sponsorship or funding biasaﬀects the data produced by a sponsored agency.\nSampling bias (also known asdistribution shift) occurs when the distribution of examples used for training doesn’t reﬂect the distribution of the inputs the model will receive in production.\nPrejudice or stereotype biasis often observed in data obtained from historical sources, such as books or photo archives, or from online activity such as social media, online forums, and comments to online publications.\nSystematic value distortion is bias usually occurring with the device making measurements or observations.\nExperimenter bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, or recall information in a way that aﬃrms one’s prior beliefs or hypotheses.\nLabeling bias happens when labels are assigned to unlabeled examples by a biased process or person.\nSelection bias can be avoided by systematically questioning the reason why a speciﬁc data source was chosen.\n\n\n\nA good habit is to question everything: who created the data, what were their motivations and quality criteria, and more importantly, how and why the data was created.\n\n\nSelf-selection bias cannot be completely eliminated. It usually appears in surveys; the mere consent of the responder to answer the questions represents self-selection bias.\n\n\nIt’s tough to avoid the omitted variable biascompletely, because, as they say, “we don’t know what we don’t know.”\n\n\nSampling bias can be avoided by researching the real proportion of various properties in the data that will be observed in production, and then sampling the training data by keeping similar proportions\n\n\nLabeling bias can be avoided by asking several labelers to identify the same example.\n\n\nConcept drift is a fundamental change in the statistical relationship between the features and the label.\n\n\nShallow algorithms, such as linear or logistic regression, and some ensemble methods, such as AdaBoost, are particularly sensitive to outliers.\n\n\nGood Data\n\n\nGood data contains enough information that can be used for modeling. For example, if you want to train a model that predicts whether the customer will buy a speciﬁc product, you will need to possess both the properties of the product in question and the properties of the products customers purchased in the past.\n\n\nGood data has good coverage of what you want to do with the model.\n\n\nGood data reﬂects real inputs that the model will see in production.\n\n\n*You are considered lucky if you can gather good data from interactions of the user with the system.\n\n\nAblob(for Binary Large OBject).\n\n\nA data lake is a repository of data stored in its natural or raw format, usually in the form of object blobs or files.\n\n\nA data lake is typically an unstructured aggregation of data from multiple sources, including databases, logs, or intermediary data obtained as a result of expensive transformations of the original data.\n\n\nCommon problems with data are high cost, bias, low predictive power, outdated examples, outliers, and leakage.\n\n\nTo build an index for fast string matching, you can, for example, use the Aho–Corasick algorithm.\n\n\nOne popular tool used in Kaggle competitions is Boruta. Boruta iteratively trains random forest models and runs statistical tests to identify features as important and unimportant. The tool exists both in the form of an R package and a Python module.\n\n\n*Boruta works as a wrapper around the random forest learning algorithm, hence its name — Boruta is a spirit of the forests in Slavic mythology.\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is the oldest of the techniques. It is also, by far, the fastest option. Performance comparison tests show a very weak dependence of the speed of the PCA algorithm on the size of the dataset. Therefore, you can eﬀectively use PCA as a step preceding your model training, and find the optimal value of the reduced dimensionality experimentally as part of the hyperparameter tuning process.\n\n\nWinsorization consists of setting all outliers to a specific percentile of the data; for example, a 90% winsorization would see all data below the 5th percentile set to the 5th percentile, and data above the 95th percentile set to the 95th percentile.\n\n\n*A feature store is a central vault for storing documented, curated, and access-controlled features within an organization. Each feature is described by four elements:\n\nname\ndescription\nmetadata\ndeﬁnition.\n\n\n\nIf the person responsible for the feature leaves the company, the product owner must be alerted automatically.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the modeling process, try to engineer as many “simple” features as possible. A feature is simple when it doesn’t take significant time to code.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the modeling process, try to engineer as many “simple” features as possible. A feature is simple when it doesn’t take significant time to code.\n\n\nWhen replacing an old, non-machine-learning-based algorithm with a statistical model, use the output of the old algorithm as a feature for the new model.\n\nUse IDs as features when needed. This might seem counter-intuitive because unique IDs don’t contribute to generalization. However, the use of IDs allows the creating of one model that has one behavior in a general case, and diﬀerent behaviors in other cases.\n\n\n\nUse categorical features with many values (more than a dozen) only when you want the model to have diﬀerent “modes” of behavior that depend on that categorical feature.\n\n\nLikewise, try to group the long tail of infrequent values under the name “Other,” or merge them with similar frequent values.\n\n\nThe feature engineering code must be carefully tested. Unit tests should cover each feature extractor. Check that each feature is generated correctly using as many inputs as possible. For each boolean feature, check that it is true when it should be true and is false when it should be false.\n\n\nThe feature extractor has to throw an exception and die if any resource during feature extraction is unavailable. Avoid silent failures that may remain unnoticed for a long time with model performance degrading or becoming completely wrong.\n\n\nThe feature extraction code must be independent of the remaining code that supports the model. It should be possible to update the code responsible for each feature without aﬀecting other features, the data processing pipeline, or the way the model is called.\n\n\nFirst, ensure the data conforms to the schema, as deﬁned by the schema file. Even if you initially prepared the data, it’s likely the original data and the current data are not the same.\n\n\n• if you observe a similar, but diﬀerent system, you can expect to get a similar, but diﬀerent machine learning model performance.\n\n\nClassiﬁcation, the zero rule algorithm strategy is to always predict the class most common in the training set, independently of the input value. It can look ineﬀective, but consider the following problem.\n\n\nYou could also use an existing rule-based system, or build your own simple rule-based system. For example, if the problem is to build a model that predicts whether a given website visitor will like a recommended article, a simple rule-based system could work as follows.\n\n\nValidation and test sets must come from the same statistical distribution. That is, their properties have to be maximally similar, but the examples belonging to the two sets must be, obviously and ideally, diﬀerent and obtained independently of one another.\n\n\nThe most accurate machine learning algorithms and models are so-called “black boxes.” They make very few prediction errors, but it may be diﬃcult to understand, and even harder to explain, why a model or an algorithm made a speciﬁc prediction.\n\n\nIn contrast, kNN, linear regression, and decision tree learning algorithms are not always the most accurate. However, their predictions are easy to interpret by a non-expert.\n\n\nModels like SVMs and linear and logistic regression models, and not-very-deep feedforward neural networks, are extremely fast at prediction time. Others, like kNN, ensemble algorithms, and very deep or recurrent neural networks, are slower.\n\n\nShortlisting candidate learning algorithms for a given problem is sometimes calledalgorithm spot-checking.\n\n\nIn practice, we choose between high precision or high recall. It’s practically impossible to have both. This is called theprecision-recall tradeoﬀ.\n\n\nFor dealing with the situations in which diﬀerent classes have diﬀerent importance, a useful metric iscost-sensitive accuracy. First, assign a cost (a positive number) to both types of mistakes: FP and FN. Then compute the counts TP, TN, FP, FN as usual, and multiply the counts for FP and FN by their corresponding costs before calculating the accuracy using Equation 2, above.\n\n\n*Cohen’s kappa statistic is a performance metric that applies to both multiclass and imbalanced learning problems. The advantage of this metric over accuracy is that Cohen’s kappa tells you how much better your classiﬁcation model is performing, compared to a classiﬁer that randomly guesses a class according to the frequency of each class.*\n\n\nDiscounted cumulative gain (DCG) is a popular measure of ranking quality in search engines. DCG measures the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom, with the gain of each result discounted at lower positions.\n\n\nIn practice, by trying to reduce variance, you increase bias, and vice versa. In other words, reducing overﬁtting leads to underﬁtting, and the other way around. This is called the bias-variance trade-oﬀ:\n\n\nRegularization is an umbrella term for methods that force a learning algorithm to train a less complex model. In practice, it leads to higher bias, but significantly reduces the variance. The two most widely used types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization.\n\n\nGradient is the generalization of derivatives for functions that take several inputs or one input in the form of a vector or some other complex structure. A gradient of a function is a vector of partial derivatives.\n\n\nBatch normalization (which rather should be called batch standardization) consists of standardizing the outputs of each layer before the next layer receives them as input. In practice, batch normalization results in faster and more stable training, as well as some regularization eﬀect. So, it’s always a good idea to use batch normalization.\n\n\nConcept drift— shift in the relationship between the features and the label.\n\n\nSome algorithms and models, such as support vector machine(SVM), decision trees, and random forests, allow the data analyst to provide weights for each class. The loss in the cost function is typically multiplied by the weight. The data analyst may, for example, provide greater weight to the minority class.\n\n\nIt’s important to note that model cascading is not always a bad practice. Using the output of one model, as one of many inputs for another model, is common.\n\n\nAs Google’s engineers mentioned: “In the absence of barriers, engineers will naturally use the most convenient signal at hand, especially when working against deadline pressures.”\n\n\nIf, despite adding more training examples and designing clever features, the performance of your model plateaus, think about diﬀerent information sources.\n\n\nMore advanced, and often preferable way of online model evaluation and selection, is multi-armed bandit(MAB). A/B testing has one major drawback. The number of test results in groups A and B you need to calculate the value of the A/B test is high.\n\n\nIdeally, we would like to expose a user to a suboptimal model as few times as possible. At the same time, we need to expose users to each of the two models a number of times suﬃcient to get reliable estimates of both models’ performance. This is known as the the exploration-exploitation dilemma: on one hand, we want to explore the models’ performance enough to be able to reliably choose the better one. On the other hand, we want to exploit the performance of the better model as much as possible.\n\n\nServerless deployment also simpliﬁes canary deployment or canarying. In software engineering, canarying is a strategy when the updated code is pushed to just a small group of end-users, usually unaware. Because the new version is only distributed to a small number of users, its impact is relatively low, and changes can be reversed quickly, should the new code contain bugs.\n\n\nRecall, canary deployment, or canarying, pushes the new model version and code to a small fraction of users while keeping the old version running for most users.\n\n\nThe principal advantage of the dynamic deployment on the users’ devices is that the calls to the model will be fast for the user. It also reduces the charge on the organization’s servers. Downsides include the diﬃculty to deliver updates to all users and the availability of the model for third-party analyses.\n\n\nMulti-armed bandits allow us to deploy the new model while keeping the old one. The algorithm replaces the old model with the new one only when it is certain that it performs better.\n\n\nWhen users interact with a learning system, there’s a phenomenon known as the creep factor. It means that the user perceives the model’s predictive capacity as too high.\n\n\nRecommender systems need additional monitoring. These models offer recommendations to website or application users. It can be useful to monitor click-through rate (CTR), that is, the ratio of users who clicked on a recommendation to the number of total users who received recommendations from that model. If CTR is decreasing, the model must be updated.\n\n\n“Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Practical-MLOps":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Machine-Learning-Engineering/Practical-MLOps","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Machine Learning Engineering/Practical MLOps.md","title":"Practical MLOps","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","mlops","data-science","devops","machine-learning","git","github","cloud","aws","azure"],"content":"Practical MLOps\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a no-nonsense book about practical MLOps and how you should approach it to solve business problems. The book takes an even more hardline approach to automation and focuses on the concept of Kaizen ML, where continuous improvement and striving to make the feedback loop even shorter and the process more and more seamless.\n🎨 Impressions\n“Facts without Theory is chaos, Theory without facts is phantasy.\nRules without ideas is prison. Ideas without rules is chaos.\nThose quotes quite stuck with me on a philosophical level.\nFurthermore, I felt like there were a lot of good examples of how to approach ML and Data Science and how to make sure you focus on business value rather than technical aspects.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWhy isn’t machine learning 10X faster? Most of the problem-building machine learning systems involve everything surrounding machine learning modeling: data engineering, data processing, problem feasibility, and business alignment. One issue with this is a focus on the “code” and technical details versus solving the business problem with machine learning. There is also a lack of automation and the issue of HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinions) culture. Finally, much of machine learning is not cloud native and uses academic datasets and academic software packages that don’t scale for large-scale problems.\n\n\nThe quicker the feedback loop (see Kaizen), the more time to focus on business problems\n\n\nA common expression is if it is not automated, it’s broken.\n\n\nCI is the process of continuously testing a software project and improving the quality based on these tests’ results.\n\n\nMicroservices A microservice is a software service with a distinct function that had little to no dependencies\n\n\nA microservice is a software service with a distinct function that had little to no dependencies\n\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of checking the infrastructure into a source code repository and “deploying” it to push changes to that repository. IaC allows for idempotent behavior and ensures the infrastructure doesn’t require humans to build it out.\n\n\nThrough logging and other tools like application performance monitoring tools such as New Relic, Data Dog, or Stackdriver, monitoring and instrumentation are essentially collecting data about the behavior of an application in production or data science for deployed software systems.\n\n\nLikewise, all MLOps team members should help develop and maintain the CI/CD system\n\n\nOne of the major things holding back machine learning projects is this necessary foundation of DevOps. After this foundation is complete, next is data automation, then platform automation, and then finally true ML automation, or MLOps, occurs.\n\n\nMany commercial tools are evolving to do DataOps. One example includes Apache Airflow, designed by Airbnb, then later open sourced, to schedule and monitor its data processing jobs. AWS tools include AWS Data Pipeline and AWS Glue. AWS Glue is a serverless ETL (Extract, Load, Transform) tool that detects a data source’s schema and then stores the data source’s metadata.\n\n\nExercises Create a new GitHub repository with necessary Python scaffolding using a Makefile, linting, and testing. Then, perform additional steps such as code formatting in your Makefile. Using GitHub Actions, test a GitHub project with two or more Python versions. Using a cloud native build server (AWS Code Build, GCP CloudBuild, or Azure DevOps Pipelines), perform continuous integration for your project. Containerize a GitHub project by integrating a Dockerfile and automatically registering new containers to a Container Registry. Create a simple load test for your application using a load test framework such as locust or loader io and automatically run this test when you push changes to a staging branch.\n\n\nNotice that the ls command is in the /bin directory. This “hint” shows that I can find other executables in this directory.\n\n\nAWS Lambda is a function as a service (FaaS) technology that runs on the AWS platform. It has the name FaaS because an AWS Lambda function can be just a few lines of code—literally a function.\n\n\nThe general idea with this code example is to pick a greedy solution to make the change. Greedy algorithms work by always taking the best option first.\n\n\nFor MLOps, convergence, i.e., creating a model that finds a solution that won’t be improved by adding more data, is an essential operational issue.\n\n\nOne of the challenges of MLOps is how multidisciplinary the field is.\n\n\nIt is also essential to be aware of foundational skills for an organization wishing to do MLOps. In particular, this means a team must know the basics of cloud computing, including the Linux terminal and how to navigate it. Likewise, a firm understanding of DevOps—i.e., how to set up and use CI/CD—is a required component to do MLOps. This final exercise is an excellent test of your skills before diving into more nuanced topics later in the book and pulls together all of these foundational components into a minimalist MLOps-style project.\n\n\nA microservice, on the other hand, is an application that is fully decoupled from system requirements like databases and can run independently.\n\n\nThis is a good suggestion. Pinning packages is always a great idea because you are safe from an update in a dependency being incompatible with the code your application needs. Be aware that pinning dependencies and never going through the chore of updating them isn’t a great idea.\n\n\nContainers increase the entire ML architecture quality by reducing complexity since the images are already “baked.”\n\n\nA pipeline is nothing more than a set of steps (or instructions) that can achieve a specific objective like publishing a model into a production environment when run. For\n\n\nMonitoring, logging, and detailed metrics of production models (aside from model performance) are absolutely critical for a robust deployment strategy. I consider them crucial for deployment, but they are a core pillar of the robust DevOps practices\n\n\nContinuous delivery and the practice of constant feedback is crucial for a robust workflow.\n\n\nAs this chapter proves, there is a lot of value in automation and continuous improvement of the feedback loop.\n\n\nShipping models into production is the number one objective, but doing so with very high confidence, in a resilient set of steps, is what you should strive for.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between canary and blue-green deployments? Which one do you prefer? Why?\n\n\nRules without ideas is prison. Ideas without rules is chaos.\n\n\nWhile AutoML is focused strictly on creating a model from clean data, KaizenML is about automating everything about the machine learning process and improving it.\n\n\nThe author Upton Sinclair famously said, “it’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”\n\n\nIt took almost 100 years, from around 1880 to 1980, to fully automate switching calls by hand to make a machine do them, but it happened.\n\n\nThere really are two classes of self-handicapping strategies, real and feigned. “Real” self-handicapping involves placing visible obstacles to success in one’s own path.\n\n\n“Feigned” self-handicapping, on the other hand, is in certain respects a less risky strategy, one in which the person merely claims that there were difficult obstacles in the path to success.\n\n\nHowever, one of the golden rules of software engineering is to use the best tools you can for the task at hand. The\n\n\nAutoML is an inflection point for data scientists because it shares similarities to other historical trends: automation and magical thinking.\n\n\nAnything that can automate will automate. Accepting this trend instead of fighting it will lead to massively more productive workflows in machine learning.\n\n\nAll complex software systems require automation and simplification of critical components. DevOps is about automating the testing and deployment of software. MLOps is about doing this and also improving the quality of both data and machine learning models.\n\n\nThe Uber Engineering blog has a good breakdown of what problem a Feature Store solves.\n\n\nAccording to Uber, it does two things: Allows users to add features they built into a shared Feature Store. Once features are in the Feature Store, they are easy to use in training and prediction.\n\n\nOne of the primary use cases for FLAML is to automate an entire modeling process with as little as three lines of code.\n\n\nELI5 ELI5 stands for “explain like I am five.” It allows you to visualize and debug machine learning models and supports several frameworks, including sklearn. SHAP SHAP is a “game-theoretic” approach to explain the output of machine learning models. In particular, it has excellent visualizations as well as explanations.\n\n\nI tell them the safe choice is Amazon. It has the widest selection of technology and the largest market share. Once you master the AWS cloud, it is easier to master other cloud offerings since they also assume you might know AWS.\n\n\nFor larger organizations with different teams and big data, SageMaker is an excellent platform to focus on because it allows for fine-grained security and enterprise-level deployment and training.\n\n\nMachine learning is not a one-and-done process. You must be committed to continually evaluating the data and the model’s accuracy as these change over time. As with all impactful projects, involve the SME (subject matter expert) early and often so that you can build the best understanding of the business problem and the data to be used for testing and validating your machine learning model.\n\n\nFinally, if you are serious about using AWS as an individual, including starting a career as an AWS machine learning expert, it can be beneficial and lucrative to get certified\n\n\nAzure has a service principal for access (and access control) to resources. When automating services and workflows, people tend to overlook or even attempt to simplify authenticating in general.\n\n\nOne of the many crucial factors for effective MLOps (of course inherited from DevOps best practices, covered in “DevOps and MLOps”) is good troubleshooting skills.\n\n\nAzure describes its ML pipelines as a good fit for three distinct scenarios: machine learning, data preparation, and application orchestration\n\n\nRemember that the most important thing to achieve as an MLOps engineer is to ship models to production, not reinvent cloud features.\n\n\nFinally, the machine learning and AI capabilities coordinate in a product called Vertex AI. One advantage of Google’s approach is that it aims to be an MLOps solution from the beginning. The workflow of Vertex AI allows a structured approach to ML, including the following:\n\n\nOne of the most important and yet neglected areas of a project involves continuous integration. Testing is a fundamental component to doing both DevOps and MLOps.\n\n\nKubeflow (end-to-end ML platform for Kubernetes\n\n\nThe next step beyond this basic tutorial is to use either GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), Google Cloud Run (container as a service), or Vertex AI to deploy a machine learning endpoint. You can use the Python MLOps Cookbook repo as a base to do this.\n\n\nOne of the crown jewels of the Google Cloud Platform is Google BigQuery, for a few reasons. One of the reasons is how easy it is to get started, and another reason is the widespread publicly available databases. A good list of Google BigQuery open datasets is available on this Reddit page\n\n\nFinally, from an MLOps perspective, one of the killer features of Google BigQuery is the ability to train and host ML models inside the Google BigQuery platform.\n\n\nIf starting an MLOps project at a larger company, the first place to start on GCP would be its Vertex AI platform, just like SageMaker on AWS or Azure ML Studio on Azure.\n\n\nPeru has several thousand potato varieties. As someone who grew up in Peru, I find this surprising to hear.\n\n\nThe project started in 2017 when both Facebook and Microsoft presented ONNX as an open ecosystem for AI model interoperability and jointly developed the project and tooling to push forward the adoption.\n\n\nFor ML operations, in particular, it is critical to isolate responsibilities as much as possible from the process of getting models into production.\n\n\nSee HTTP access as access democracy: tremendous flexibility for other systems and languages to interact from their implementations into a separate service in a remote location using the HTTP spec.\n\n\n“Facts without Theory is chaos, Theory without facts is phantasy.\n\n\nThere are many unlikely benefits to ignorance. Ignorance gives you the courage to try something challenging, where if you knew how difficult it was, you would never have done\n\n\nAs a professor, I teach machine learning at top universities and also am an industry practitioner. The academic tools like sklearn and pandas and the educational datasets on Kaggle are the “Kata.” These datasets and tools are necessary to “strip away” the real-world complexity to teach the material. A critical next step is to make the student aware that machine learning Kata is not real-world.\n\n\n*Implementing MLOps in your organization. First, here are a set of final, global recommendations:\n\nStart with small wins.\nUse the cloud, don’t fight the cloud.  Get you and your team certified on a cloud platform and an ML specialization.\nAutomate from the start of a project. An excellent initial automation step is the continuous integration of your project. Another way of putting this is that “if it isn’t automated, it is broken.” Practice Kaizen, i.e., continuous improvement with your pipeline. This method improves the software quality, the data quality, the model quality, and the customer feedback.\nWhen dealing with large teams or big data, focus on using platform technology such as AWS SageMaker, Databricks, Amazon EMR, or Azure ML Studio. Let the platform do the heavy lifting for your team.\nDon’t focus only on the complexity of techniques, i.e., deep learning versus solving the problem with any tool that works.\nTake data governance and cybersecurity seriously. One way to accomplish this is by using enterprise support for your platform and having regular audits of your architecture and practices.\n\n\n\n*Finally, there are three laws of automation to consider when thinking about MLOps:\n\nAny task that talks about being automated will eventually be automated.\nIf it isn’t automated, it’s broken.\nIf a human is doing it, a machine eventually will do it better.*\n\n\n\nA build server is an application that works in both the testing and deployment of software.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Analytical-Skills-for-AI-and-Data-Science":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Analytical-Skills-for-AI-and-Data-Science","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Modeling/Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science.md","title":"Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","data-science","analytics","data-analysis"],"content":"Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book strives to merge the gap between business and data science. It is about understanding the business value of analytics and what is important to work on.\n🎨 Impressions\nThe most important skills of a data scientist are business savvy and communication mastery.\nUnderstanding the action is the driver of the value propositions.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nA third group, the practitioners, actually dislike the term and prefer to use the less sexy machine learning (ML) label to describe what they do.\n\n\nNot so long ago, the queen of tech headlines was big data, and hardly anyone talked about AI\n\n\nThe first pillar involved the now well-known three Vs: volume, variety, and velocity. The internet transformation had provided companies with ever-increasing volumes of data.\n\n\n“By analytics we mean the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions.”\n\n\n“Analytical skills are, simply put, problem-solving skills. They are characteristics and abilities that allow you to approach problems in a logical, rational manner in an effort to sort out the best solution.”\n\n\nIn this book I will define analytical reasoning as the ability to translate\n\n\nTake Tyrion Lannister’s quote in the Game of Thrones “The Dance of Dragons” episode: “It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor” (my emphasis). Tyrion seems to be claiming that we have the tendency to confuse the descriptive and prescriptive when things turn out well, in what may well be a form of confirmation bias.\n\n\nHow should we value our customers? One approach is to assign the current value derived from each one of them. The problem with this short-term view is that companies invest in their customers all the time, from acquisition to retention, marketing, etc., so to value those investments we also need the long-run view from the revenues side.\n\n\nThe CLV measures the discounted present value of all profits obtained from a relationship with one customer along their expected duration with the company.\n\n\nStarting from the right, it is useful to repeat one more time that we always start with the business. If your objective is unclear or fuzzy, most likely the decision shouldn’t be made at all.\n\n\nCompanies tend to have a bias for action, so fruitless decisions are sometimes made. This may not only have unintended negative consequences on the business side; it could also take a toll on employees’ energy and morale.\n\n\nAction: offer a discount Consequence: customers increase their demand for our product Outcome: revenues increase\n\n\nOne of my favorite quotes—commonly ascribed to Albert Einstein—is that “everything should be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.” In the same vein, statistician George Box famously said that “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” Models are simplifications, metaphors that help us understand the workings of the highly complex world we live in.\n\n\nYou may check Thomas Davenport’s now classic Competing on Analytics or\n\n\nMastering ‘Metrics’: The Path from Cause to Effect\n\n\nMost companies sell more than one product or offer more than one service. Economists call the natural advantage that a company may have when offering products that can benefit from similar production processes economies of scope. It is thus logical for most of us to look for ways to deepen our relationship with our customers by trying to do some cross-selling. In consulting jargon, it has been relabeled as the now-famous next-best offer, which already takes us to the prescriptive terrain.\n\n\nBusiness objectives are usually already defined: but we must learn to ask the right business questions to achieve these objectives.\n\n\nAlways start with the business objective and move backward: for any decision you’re planning or have already made, think about the business objective you want to achieve. You can then move backward to figure out the set of possible levers and how these create consequences that affect the business.\n\n\nCheck Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett’s Data Science for Business (O’Reilly).\n\n\nIn my opinion, the literature has at least two shortcomings: most data scientists rarely care about solving the prescriptive problem and would rather focus on providing high-quality predictive solutions. Also, the literature directed to business people hasn’t been able to provide end-to-end views of decision problems that can be tackled with AI and analytical thinking.\n\n\nOne word of caution: to find levers, we need to know our business. This is not to say that you must have spent many years in one specific industry. That might help, as you must’ve developed strong intuitions about why things work and when they don’t. But it is also true that many times having a non-expert, even naive, view can help us think out of the box and expand our menu of options.\n\n\nIn general, we can divide levers into two types: those that depend mostly on the rules of the physical world to create consequences and those that arise from human behavior.\n\n\nThanks to Henry Ford’s assembly line, for instance, the production of cars was greatly improved. It only took a complete redesign of the production process, but once you pulled that “lever” you were able to produce more cars in less time, with the consequent reduction in production costs.\n\n\nThe difficulty comes from what economists call the “Law of Demand”: when we increase our price, our sales generally fall.\n\n\nThe second type has to do with the other side of the network. Think about Uber: if more drivers join, it is easier for passengers to find rides, so now more customers join. But the larger demand also makes joining more profitable for the drivers: you can now see why two-sided platforms generate these huge positive feedback loops. It is common to refer to these as “strategic effects,” since our behavior depends on the choices of others, and vice versa.\n\n\nMost certainly: one of the most popular levers for two-sided markets is to subsidize the side of the market that is most price sensitive by way of discounts or lower fees.\n\n\nOnce we define a business objective, we must consider whether it’s actionable: most times our problems are actionable, but we may have to think out of the box.\n\n\nHypotheses often fail, but we should embrace the learning process: many times we start with a theory about causes and consequences only to see it fail during testing. That’s fine. It’s part of the process. Embrace it and guarantee your team learns from these failures.\n\n\nOne good practice is to start considering only first-order effects with the objective of getting the “sign” or “direction” of the effect right. At this point we may not care about the second-order effects that affect the curvature of the outcome.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb of when to stop can be found by way of standard cost-benefit analysis: stop when the incremental cost of another iteration exceeds the benefits you expect to get from it.\n\n\nWe impact our business objectives by making decisions: as analytical thinkers, it is our job to find, test, and enrich the set of actions or levers we can pull to achieve our business objectives.\n\n\nAccording to one school of thought—the frequentist school—we can think of an experiment as one that takes place many times under the same conditions.\n\n\nAs it is commonly said, uncertainty unravels once we’ve made a decision, at which point we might regret our choice if the realization was not satisfactory.\n\n\nBernoulli proposed a solution: we shouldn’t value each prize at face value, rather, we should be using a utility function that displays the diminishing value that each extra dollar represents to us.\n\n\nBandit problems are a class of sequential decision problems where we must make a choice that repeats over time, and as time goes on we are learning the workings of the underlying uncertainty, either by improving our probability estimates or the expected values themselves.\n\n\nBefore going on, let’s discuss several points. First, you may be wondering if it’s really necessary to write down everything mathematically and be very explicit about uncertainty. The answer is that the vast majority of practitioners do not go through the trouble of formalizing everything. I think it’s a good practice because it forces you to think really hard about the sources of uncertainty and how to model each of them, as well as the simplifying assumptions made.\n\n\nA second point has to do with making the model more realistic: here we assumed that customers care only about quality, but I argued that they also care (and trade-off) about price and customer experience.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Hands-On-Unsupervised-Learning-Using-Python":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Hands-On-Unsupervised-Learning-Using-Python","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Modeling/Hands-On Unsupervised Learning Using Python.md","title":"Hands-On Unsupervised Learning Using Python","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","machine-learning","unsupervised-learning","data","neural-networks","machine-learning/modeling","machine-learning/reinforcement-learning","machine-learning/models/knn","machine-learning/models/SVM","machine-learning/models/PCA"],"content":"Hands-On Unsupervised Learning Using Python\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an introduction to unsupervised machine learning techniques and practices. It introduces methods of unsupervised learning for clustering, correlations and time series analysis. It analyses models and provides guidance on how to use them.\n🎨 Impressions\nI think being good at unsupervised learning might be a hidden superpower.\nUnderstanding dimensionality reduction is very important; why do we do it why is it powerful, and what are the disadvantages?\nI think unsupervised learning is a powerful but underutilised tool.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThis is why labels are so powerful—they help guide the AI agent by providing it with an error measure. The AI uses the error measure to improve its performance over time.\n\n\nTo address this, we can introduce unsupervised learning as a regularizer. Regularization is a process used to reduce the complexity of a machine learning algorithm, helping it capture the signal in the data without adjusting too much to the noise.\n\n\nBy building probability distributions using unsupervised learning, we can assess how different the current data is from the training set data—if the two are different enough, we can automatically trigger a retraining.\n\n\nClassification problems also may be referred to as qualitative or categorical problems.\n\n\nClassification problems are also known as discrete prediction problems because each class is a discrete group. Classification problems also may be referred to as qualitative or categorical problems.\n\n\nIn regression, the AI must predict a continuous variable rather than a discrete one. Regression problems also may be referred to as quantitative problems.\n\n\nAlso, KNN is very sensitive to the choice of k. When k is set too low, KNN can overfit, and when k is set too high, KNN can underfit.\n\n\nUnlike linear methods, KNN is highly flexible and adept at learning more complex, nonlinear relationships.\n\n\nThe choice of k is very important. If k is set to a very low value, KNN becomes very flexible, drawing highly nuanced boundaries and potentially overfitting the data. If k is set to a very high value, KNN becomes inflexible, drawing a too rigid boundary and potentially underfitting the data.\n\n\nInstead of using a linear method, we can have the AI build a decision tree where all the instances are segmented or stratified into many regions, guided by the labels we have.\n\n\nBest-performing supervised-learning algorithms for prediction problems.\n\n\nTree-based methods are difficult to interpret, especially if many rules are needed to make a good prediction.\n\n\nInstead of building trees to separate data, we can\n\n\nAlgorithms to create hyperplanes in space that separate the data, guided by the labels that we have. The approach is known as support vector machines (SVMs).\n\n\nOne approach to learning the underlying structure of data is to identify which features out of the full set of features are most important in explaining the variability among the instances in the data.\n\n\nOne such algorithm is k-means clustering. With this algorithm, we specify the number of desired clusters k, and the algorithm will assign each instance to exactly one of these k clusters. It optimizes the grouping by minimizing the within-cluster variation (also known as inertia) such that the sum of the within-cluster variations across all k clusters is as small as possible.\n\n\nThe action taken by the agent given the current state of the environment determines the next state, and the agent’s goal is to maximize its long-term reward. This family of problems is known as finite Markov decision processes.\n\n\nStandardization rescales the data to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.\n\n\nSome machine learning solutions are very sensitive to the scale of the data, so having all the data on the same relative scale—via standardization—is a good machine learning practice. Another common method to scale data is normalization, which rescales the data to a zero to one range. Unlike the standardized data, all the normalized data is on a positive scale.\n\n\nPCA does this by addressing the correlation among features. If the correlation is very high among a subset of the features, PCA will attempt to combine the highly correlated features and represent this data with a smaller number of linearly uncorrelated features.\n\n\nAnother linear dimensionality reduction technique is random projection, which relies on the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma. According to the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a much lower-dimensional space so that distances between the points are nearly preserved. In other words, even as we move from high-dimensional\n\n\nAnother linear dimensionality reduction technique is random projection, which relies on the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma.

According to the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a much lower-dimensional space so that distances between the points are nearly preserved. In other words, even as we move from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space, the relevant structure of the original feature set is preserved.\n\n\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) is a form of nonlinear dimensionality reduction that learns the similarity of points in the original dataset and, using this similarity learning, models this in a lower dimensional space:\n\n\nAnother popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction method is called locally linear embedding (LLE). This method preserves distances within local neighborhoods as it projects the data from the original feature space to a reduced space.\n\n\nLLE discovers the nonlinear structure in the original, high-dimensional data by segmenting the data into smaller components (i.e., into neighborhoods of points) and modeling each component as a linear embedding.\n\n\nT-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. t-SNE accomplishes this by modeling each high-dimensional point into a two- or three-dimensional space, where similar points are modeled close to each other and dissimilar points are modeled farther away.\n\n\nDictionary learning, which learns the sparse representation of the original data. The resulting matrix is known as the dictionary, and the vectors in the dictionary are known as atoms. These atoms are simple, binary vectors, populated by zeros and ones. Each instance in the original data can be reconstructed as a weighted sum of these atoms. Assuming there are d features in the original data and n atoms in the dictionary, we can have a dictionary that is either undercomplete, where n &lt; d, or overcomplete, where n &gt; d.\n\n\nClustering, which attempts to group objects together based on similarity.\n\n\nClustering achieves this without using any labels, comparing how similar the data for one observation is to data for other observations and groups.\n\n\nIn k-means clustering, we specify the number of desired clusters k, and the algorithm will assign each observation to exactly one of these k clusters. The algorithm optimizes the groups by minimizing the within-cluster variation (also known as inertia) such that the sum of the within-cluster variations across all k clusters is as small as possible.\n\n\nRecall that HDBSCAN will group borrowers together based on how closely packed together their attributes are in a high-dimensional space. Unlike k-means or hierarchical clustering, not all the borrowers will be grouped. Some borrowers that are very distinct from other groups of borrowers may remain ungrouped. These are outlier borrowers and are worth investigating to see if there is a good business reason they are dissimilar from other borrowers.\n\n\nOne area that unsupervised learning excels in is feature extraction, which is a method used to generate a new feature representation from an original set of features; the new feature representation is called a learned representation and is used to improve performance on supervised learning problems. In other words, feature extraction is an unsupervised means to a supervised end.\n\n\nAn autoencoder comprises two parts, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder\n\n\nAnother regularization technique is sparsity. We can force the autoencoder to take the sparsity of the matrix into consideration such that the majority of the autoencoder’s neurons are inactive most of the time—in other words, they do not fire. This makes it harder for the autoencoder to memorize the identity function even when the autoencoder is overcomplete because most of the nodes cannot fire and, therefore, cannot overfit the observations as easily.\n\n\nCommon problem with real-world data is noisiness data is often distorted in some way because of data quality issues from data capture, data migration, data transformation, etc. We need autoencoders to be robust enough against such noise so that they are not fooled and can learn from the truly important underlying structure in the data.\n\n\nIn the real world, the distinction is not quite so clear. Datasets are usually partially labeled, and we want to efficiently label the unlabeled observations while leveraging the information in the labeled set. With supervised learning, we would have to toss away the majority of the dataset because it is unlabeled.\n\n\nThe field of semisupervised learning blends the benefits of both supervised and unsupervised learning, taking advantage of the few labels that are available to uncover structure in a dataset and help label the rest.\n\n\nNow, we will move into generative unsupervised models, which involve learning a probability distribution from an original dataset and using it to make inferences about never-before-seen data.\n\n\nNote that RBMs use a stochastic approach to learning the underlying structure of data, whereas autoencoders, for example, use a deterministic approach.\n\n\nThere are two major categories of recommender systems—collaborative filtering recommender systems and content-based filtering recommender\n\n\nContent-based filtering is not commonly used because it is a rather difficult task to learn the distinct properties of items—this level of understanding is very challenging for artificial machines to achieve currently.\n\n\nCollaborative filtering requires no knowledge of the underlying items themselves. Rather, collaborative filtering assumes that users that agreed in the past will agree in the future and that user preferences remain stable over time.\n\n\nThere is a third group of data that combines cross-sectional and time series data. This is known as panel or longitudinal data.\n\n\nClustering time series data is a purely unsupervised approach and does not require annotation of data for training, although annotated data is necessary for validating the results as with all other unsupervised learning experiments.\n\n\nWe will use the tslearn package to access the Python-based k-shape algorithm. tslearn has a similar framework as Scikit-learn but is geared toward work with time\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Practical-Recommendation-Systems":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Practical-Recommendation-Systems","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Modeling/Practical Recommendation Systems.md","title":"Practical Recommendation Systems","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","product-recommendation","ranking-systems","machine-learning","bayesian","recommender-systems","science","statistics"],"content":"Practical Recommendation Systems\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an easy and good introduction to recommendation systems. It is meant to introduce the concept of recommendation systems and, from there, give concepts and methods on how to make them. This book is about usage rather than the theoretical background.\n🎨 Impressions\nYou have recommendation algorithms and ranking algorithms. Ranking algorithms consider the relative ranking of the items, while recommendations look for similar items based either on content or similarity with other users.\nThere is an inverse relationship between complexity (and performance) and explainability.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe moment that recommendations have the power to influence decisions, they become a target for spammers, scammers, and other people with less-than-noble motives for influencing our decisions. —Daniel Tunkelang\n\n\nCertain systems explain the recommendations. Recommenders with that ability are called white-box recommenders; those that don’t are called black-box recommenders.\n\n\nThe better the quality of the recommendation, the more complex and the harder to show explanations. This problem is known as model accuracy-model interpretation trade-off.\n\n\nContent-based filtering uses the metadata you have on the items in your catalog. Netflix uses descriptions of its movies, for example.\n\n\nI definitely recommend Deep Learning (The MIT Press, 2016) if you have a background in machine learning.\n\n\nSites that use voting are called reputation systems.\n\n\nA user-item matrix can be thought of as a table that has a row for each user and a column for each item (or the other way around).\n\n\nA rating is, for example, the number of stars on Amazon or Glassdoor, a site where people can rate their workplaces), or a list of hearts in my local newspaper’s movie reviews\n\n\nMore formally, a rating is something that glues together three things: user, content, and the user’s sentiment toward the content item\n\n\nUser-item matrix isn’t always as populated. In fact, usually nonempty cells are rare because many internet shops have numerous users and plentiful items.\n\n\nIt’s definitely not a good thing to have a matrix that looks like a Danish beach in wintertime\n\n\nFor now, let’s focus on how to populate this matrix either from explicit ratings (added manually by users) or implicit ratings (calculated from the evidence you collect).\n\n\nWhen a user manually gives a content item a rating, it’s called an explicit rating.\n\n\nImplicit ratings are deduced from monitoring people’s behavior. Sounds kind of scary when it’s written like that, doesn’t it? But remember, you’re trying to ease information overload and help users, not stalk and manipulate them into buying more.\n\n\nAlgorithm, which puts importance into recent events and not so much on older ones. These types of algorithms are called time-decay algorithms.\n\n\nThe formula takes the score (how many people upvoted this story minus how many who downvoted it) and divides that with a time decay element, using a term they call gravity, which indicates how fast an item’s ranking decays:\n\n\nThis problem is closely related to the well-known term frequency–inverse document frequency problem (TF-IDF among friends).\n\n\nOften commercials are about things that the seller is trying to convince the user is a good offer or cheap (even if it isn’t), while a recommendation is about finding the user what they want.\n\n\nA recommender system can be built in many ways, depending on how many recommendations you need to serve, the size of content catalog, and the number of visitors. One thing for certain is that you want it to be a structure that’s independent from your website, because you can quickly drown performance.\n\n\nLet’s define some numbers that can make it easier to decide if a rule is valid or merely a coincidence. The problem about the three-out-of-six itemset from the example is that bread is present in five out of six transactions, so it would be hard not to find transactions containing bread. To take that into account, you’ll define confidence as the number of transactions in which the itemset is divided by the total number of times the first item is present.\n\n\n5 Iterate through the itemsets and remove the ones that don’t fulfill the confidence requirement.\n\n\nAdding a version number to the recommendations in your database lets you have several versions in the database at one time, which means that you can have one that’s used in production and then switch to a new one when your ready to go live. But more importantly, if something happens with the recommendations that you’re currently using, you can revert to an older version.\n\n\nUnder the umbrella of cold-start problems are also gray sheep. These are users who have such individual tastes that even if there’s data, there are no other users who’ve bought any of the products they have.\n\n\nCluster analysis is a less subjective way of finding the segments and can be done using unsupervised machine learning. A cluster is a fancy word for a group with similar traits, so we’ll try to find particular types of users who consume specific content\n\n\n“Sometimes you need to take a step back to get ahead.” This proverb is always irritating when it’s thrown at you, but sometimes it’s necessary. This is the idea behind the next method of getting around gray sheep and some cold products.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, you have to turn to something called active learning, and it’s cool. But sadly, it’s beyond the scope of this book. A good place to go to learn more is in the publicly available article “Active Learning” by Ruben, et al. Active learning for recommender systems is about creating an algorithm that comes up with good examples for the user to rate, which then provides the recommender with valuable information about the person’s preferences\n\n\nCold-start problems mean you have to decide what to recommend to new visitors on your site. Introducing new products is also a cold-start problem, which we’ll look at in more detail in later chapters\n\n\nSegments can be built or generated to make semi-personalized recommendations. Alternatively, demographics can be used to create demographic recommendations.\n\n\nYou can calculate similarity in many ways, but the overall problem can be defined as follows: Given two items, i1 and i2, the similarity between them is given by the function sim(i1, i2).\n\n\nWe’ll start by looking at the Jaccard similarity, which is used to compare sets.\n\n\nThis was originally coined coefficient de communaté by Paul Jaccard, who came up with this distance measure to indicate how close two sets are to each other. You’ll also find it under the names Jaccard index or Jaccard similarity coefficient.\n\n\nThis way of measuring distance or similarity goes by the sexy name of Manhattan distance. It’s part of what’s called taxicab geometry. In more established circles, however, it goes by the name of L1-norm. The idea is that if you want to measure the distance between two street corners in Manhattan, you drive a grid, rather than measure as the crow flies.\n\n\nAccording to the L1-norm, you’d calculate a similarity measure of 3 + 5 = 8. Often, you’ll run into the mean absolute error (MAE), which is calculated using the average of the L1 norm.\n\n\nThe big brother of L1-norm is the L2-norm, which geometrically can be considered the distance between two points not travelled by a taxi in Manhattan but by the crow, going directly from one point to the next. Basically, it stems from the famous Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, which says that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite a right angle in a triangle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\n\nThe L2-norm is known as the Euclidian norm.\n\n\nAnother way of looking at content is to see the rows of the rating matrix as vectors in space, and then look at the angle between them.\n\n\nClustering is also called segmentation. We talked about it in an earlier chapter when we discussed non-personalized recommendations. At that time, we talked about using segmentation to find groups of users that are similar to a new visitor based on demographic data. The purpose here is more of an optimization because you want to find clusters of users to narrow down how many times you calculate user-user similarity.\n\n\nK-means clustering is what’s called an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It’s unsupervised because you don’t give it any examples of what the correct input-output pairs would look like. It’s also a parametric algorithm because you need to give it a parameter, k, for it to run.\n\n\nK-means clusters are great in toy examples, but always be careful about checking the results. As you saw, they can easily end in a suboptimal state, which would create strange recommendations to users. (The example you looked at came with a warning reminding you that examples are constructed to explain the algorithm, but it hides the fact that many algorithms are difficult to make work according to the executor’s needs. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\nThis chapter introduces collaborative filtering and goes into detail about the branch of it called neighborhood-based filtering. Collaborative filtering is an umbrella of methods. What unites those is the selection of data. These filtering methods only use ratings (implicit or explicit) as the source for creating recommendations.\n\n\nNeighborhood collaborative filter-based algorithms were the first algorithms to be categorized as a recommender systems algorithm.\n\n\nMost people consider themselves unique and don’t like to be segmented into a particular type. But that’s exactly what using collaborative filtering to calculate recommendations is all about. In all its simplicity, collaborative filtering recommends a list of items for you. The list is created based on people who like the same things as you, but who also like something that you haven’t yet consumed.\n\n\nIn short, either you find similar users to the active user and then recommend the films they liked that the active user hasn’t watched, or you find the liked items of the active user and come up with similar items to recommend. To make all this work, you’re back at the rating matrix to describe users’ preferences\n\n\nYou may come across the term user-user-based filtering in your quest for knowledge. The reason why people are still talking about user-user-based filtering is that it’s a better way to give recommendations. If you do item-to-item filtering, you’ll find items similar to what user A, for example, has already rated, but similar items won’t provide the serendipity that similar ratings can provide.\n\n\n*To get a feel for how the similarity is distributed, it’s a good idea to look at one on each end of the scale and one in the middle:\n\nClose to 1—LM and SS are interesting because you can see that they’re dissimilar to all except themselves. They’ve a high similarity because all users agree on rating both either above or under. But then why is it not 1? Because the ratings aren’t exactly the same. If they were the same, it would be 1, as is the case with AV and MIB.\nClose to -1—SS and AV are the most dissimilar, which also makes sense. I can imagine that most people who like Ace Ventura won’t like Sense and Sensibility, and vice versa.\nClose to 0—The similarity between Ace Ventura and Braveheart is close to zero. This is an indication that some users like Ace Ventura, others don’t, and vice versa. In this example, there are only three users who rated both, so it doesn’t say much. Two users rate both films below average, while one is positive about Ace Ventura but negative about Braveheart.*\n\n\n\nCollaborative filtering requires data, which is a problem when you receive new users as well as new items—you have no data for generating recommendations.\n\n\nThe fact that collaborative filtering is content-agnostic is also a great plus. You don’t have to spend any energy adding metadata to your content or collect knowledge about your users. You only need the ratings and the interactions between items.\n\n\nAmazon’s first stab at a recommender system was item-based collaborative filtering.\n\n\nBuilding offline experiments to evaluate recommender systems ☐ A rough understanding of online testing Why\n\n\nYou want to be surprised by finding things in your recommendations that you love but never knew you would. Serendipity is about giving the user that sensation, so that all their visits aren’t more of the same. Serendipity is subjective and difficult to calculate, so I’ll ask you to remember that it’s important and to make sure that you don’t constrain the recommender’s returns too much.\n\n\nConstraining means less serendipity.\n\n\nAs a software engineer, you should know about regression testing, which means that you should have a test set that can be run either nightly or at least every time somebody makes a change to the code base. Often people argue that these algorithms are way too complicated to run automatic tests on. If you run into one of those people, please rap them on their knuckles, especially if they claim that the business can’t afford it.\n\n\nDecision support is about taking each element and asking if the system was right or wrong. If you consider a recommender system and look at each recommended item and compare it to a user’s actual consumption, you can have four outcomes: for a given item, it can either be recommended or not, and the user can either have consumed it or not. If the recommender recommends the item, we say it’s positive, and then if the user consumes the item, we say it was the right decision. We consider it positive if the item was recommended and true if the recommender and the user agree, so you get these outcomes:\n\n\nSampling is about extracting a subset of the data that represents the same distribution across communities and oddities as the full data set. That can be difficult.\n\n\nRecommend Statistical Methods in Recommender Systems\n\n\nTo use the descriptions, you first need to make a bag-of-words (BoW) model, meaning that you split the description into an array of words:\n\n\nA stemmer usually refers to the heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal, correctly most of the time, while the lemmatizer is referred to doing things properly.6\n\n\nTF-IDF was once king, but after the invention of LDA models, it’s fallen out of grace. Everyone’s first choice now is to use LDA models or similar topic models.\n\n\nHowever, before you believe I took up your time explaining something you might not use, it’s worth mentioning that TF-IDF is something that you can use to clean the input of the LDA. TF-IDF is a classic method and has been widely used, but new algorithms are also gaining traction—one in particular called Okapi BM25.8\n\n\nL is for latent, which means hidden. Usually in mathematics and machine learning it means something that is found by an algorithm. It is the same here. Allocation refers to the fact that that all words are allocated into the hidden (latent) topics.\n\n\nThe LDA model (short for Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n\n\nIf you line up a list of K topics and all the words that are present in the documents, it’s hard to imagine ever coming up with a solution. But because words related to the same topic are often found in the same document, then you already have information to start with. If you know one word is already in a topic, then you’ve information about whether another word should be there. This is what Gibbs sampling takes advantage\n\n\nGibbs sampling begins by randomly adding topics to documents and words to topics. Imagine the arrows set at random in figure 10.14. The Gibbs sampler goes through each document and each word, and, given the probabilities of all the remaining words in each document, it adjusts the probability of that word.\n\n\nUsing LDA. You can change the parameters alpha and beta to adjust the distributions of both the documents and the words in the topics. If you enter a high alpha, then you’ll distribute each document over many topics; low alpha distributes only a few topics. The advantage with high alpha is that documents seem to be more similar, while if you have specialized documents, then a low alpha will keep them divided into few topics.\n\n\nThe same is true for beta: a high beta leads to topics being more similar because the probabilities will be distributed on more words that are used to describe each topic. For example, instead of having 10 words in a topic with a probability above 1%, you might have 40. This allows for bigger overlap.\n\n\nTF-IDF is easy, apart from remembering that its acronym means term frequency–inverse document frequency. You can use it to find important words in documents.\n\n\nBefore feeding descriptions and texts to an algorithm, it’s good to remove unwanted words and optimize for the algorithm. This can be done with removing stop words, popular words, stemming, and using TF-IDF to remove words that aren’t important\n\n\nEvaluating content-based recommenders can be done by dividing each user’s ratings into training and testing data (as you learned in chapter 9). Then run through each user and calculate the recommendations to see if it produced something that was in the test set.\n\n\nContent-based recommender systems are good because they don’t need much information about the user.\n\n\nContent-based recommender systems will find similar items, which might not always be the most surprising and fun recommendations to get.\n\n\nThink about the data as a cloud of points, and you want to project the data into a lower-dimensional space where the distance between the objects is the same. Then the points that were further from each other before the reduction are also further away after the reduction, and nearby items are also closer after the reduction. You want to reduce the data so that only the directions that provide more information are retained. If the algorithm succeeds, then the vectors pointing in those directions are said to be latent factors.\n\n\nMatrix is Latin for womb.\n\n\nFactorization is about splitting things up.\n\n\nGradient descent is a way to find optimal points on a graph, where optimal means the lowest point (or the highest point).\n\n\nIn the world of gradient descent, it’s called the learning rate, which translates to how big a step you should take every time you want to move to the next point.\n\n\nDon’t stress because I added a Greek letter; it’s an alpha. In the world of gradient descent, it’s called the learning rate, which translates to how big a step you should take every time you want to move to the next point.\n\n\nBatch gradient descent because you calculate all the errors every time you move the value of the parameters\n\n\nIf your rating matrix is sparse, then you might run into overfitting problems, where the algorithm learns the training data too well and suddenly the MSE of the test data starts increasing.\n\n\nUser factor matrix—Where each column represents a user described by the latent factors.\n\n\nItem bias—Where certain items are generally considered better—or worse— than others. The bias describes the difference between the global mean and the item’s mean. 4 User bias—Encompasses different rating scales for different users. With these four things, you can calculate a predicted rating for any item for any user using the formula we discussed earlier and shown here:\n\n\nBrute force is easy to describe: you calculate a predicted rating for each user for each item, then you sort all the predictions and return the top N items. While you’re at it, you can also save all the predictions so that you have them ready when the user visits.\n\n\nOne way to create recommendations is to find the items with factor vectors that are close to the active user’s vector.\n\n\nThis model you created quickly goes out of date. Ideally, you should start a new run as soon as it’s finished, but, depending on how much your data changes, you can do recalculate your model once each night or even once a week. But remember, every time a user interacts with a new item, it might be evidence that will show connections among the items and could give further inklings about the user’s taste.\n\n\nSVD is a way of doing matrix factorization; it’s well accepted in many libraries, which makes it a good method to use. The downside is that it won’t work if your matrix isn’t complete, meaning with no empty cells. You’ll have to fill those cells in with something, and that something is hard to do because they’re empty when you don’t know what should be there.\n\n\nGradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are super tools for solving optimization problems like the one defined to train and optimize the Funk SVD.\n\n\nAn ensemble is defined as a group of things viewed as a whole rather than individually. It’s the same for ensemble recommenders: you combine predictions from different recommenders into one recommendation.\n\n\nNOTE The difference between an ensemble and a mixed recommender is that the hybrid might not show anything of the result for one recommender, while the mixed hybrid always shows everything.\n\n\nThe feature-weighted linear stacking (FWLS) algorithm enables the system to use feature recommenders in a function-weighted way, which makes it strong.\n\n\nLearning to Rank (LTR) algorithms and learn how to distinguish pointwise, pairwise, and listwise comparisons of ranks.\n\n\nCollaborative filtering algorithms are prone to recommend items liked by few people, but by people who really like the content. The algorithm has no concept of popularity and could be used for re-ranking instead of as the sole source for the ordering\n\n\nInstead of re-ranking items and rating predictions, why not start with the aim of ranking and then construct algorithms that optimize for that? This is the goal of LTR algorithms.\n\n\nLTR algorithms are distinguished by the way they evaluate the ranked list during training. Figure 13.5 illustrates\n\n\nThe pointwise approach is the same as the recommenders you looked at in earlier chapters. It produces a score for each item and then ranks them accordingly.\n\n\nPairwise is a type of binary classifier. It’s a function that takes two items and returns an ordering of the two. When you talk about pairwise ranking, you usually optimize the output so you’ve the minimal number of inversions of items compared to the optimal rank of the items. An inversion means that two items change places.\n\n\nTo do pairwise ordering, you need what’s called an absolute ordering. An absolute ordering means that for any two content items in the catalog, you can say one is more relevant than the other or is tied.\n\n\nListwise is the king of all LTR subgroups because it looks at the whole ranked list and optimizes that. The advantage of listwise ranking is that it intuits that ordering is more important at the top of a ranked list than at the bottom. Pointwise and pairwise algorithms don’t distinguish where on the ranked list you are.\n\n\nThe Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) can be used on top of the matrix factorization method you looked at in chapter 10, but also with other types of algorithms.\n\n\nExplicit ratings can be a reflection of mood or a result of social influences and can’t always be trusted to indicate what the user wants. Implicit ratings are, as the name implies, implicit, and you or the machine have to deduce what the collection of events that have occurred between each user and item indicate.\n\n\nThe first personalized recommendation method was collaborative filtering, which provides recommendations based on similar behavior, either between users or between items.\n\n\nWe talked about the traditional singular value decomposition (SVD) and then moved on to the Funk SVD, which got excellent results in the Netflix Prize competition\n\n\nI can heartily recommend Recommender Systems Handbook by Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach.\n\n\nI did get to talk a bit about A/B testing in chapter 9, but for this, the next topics you need to learn about are exploit/explore methods and multi-armed bandits. For that purpose, I recommend Statistical Methods for Recommender System by Deepak Agarwal and Bee-Chung Chen\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Pricing-and-Revenue-Optimization":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Machine-Learning/Modeling/Pricing-and-Revenue-Optimization","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Machine Learning/Modeling/Pricing and Revenue Optimization.md","title":"Pricing and Revenue Optimization","links":[],"tags":["books"],"content":"Pricing and Revenue Optimization\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIt is a book about price optimization as well as revenue management. It consists of multiple ways to do price optimization and deals with techniques from the industry.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is especially the hotel and airline industry that drove price optimization and revenue management. Things I especially found interesting were how to structure the optimization problem and how to deal with some problems.\nOptimization problems related to pricing have in hindsight been quite an interesting read for me. I go back to this from time to time and in discussions it has been quite helpful.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWhat is a cynic? … A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\n\n\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of pricing and revenue optimization is its use of analytical techniques derived from management science, statistics, and machine learning.\n\n\nOne of the first applications of pricing optimization was revenue management, which was first used by the passenger airlines in the 1980s.\n\n\nPricing and revenue optimization can deliver more than just short-term profitability benefits. Revenue management enabled American Airlines to meet the challenge posed by PeopleExpress.\n\n\nFor example, one article estimated that in 2018 Amazon changed 2.5 million prices every day.\n\n\n“Traditional price-sensitivity research can cost up to $300,000 for each product category and take anywhere from six to ten weeks to complete… . On the Internet, however, prices can be tested continually in real time, and customers’ responses can be instantly received”\n\n\nBecause of this success, machine learning is often offered as a panacea for any complex business decision.\n\n\nIn particular, training a neural net generally requires observations that span the range of combinations of possible decisions and environmental factors with enough observations to enable statistically reliable recommendations of price for all future combinations that might occur.\n\n\n*All four factors that have accelerated the field of pricing and revenue optimization\n\nThe success of revenue management\nThe evolving computational environment\nThe rise of e-commerce\nThe increasing sophistication of machine learning\npoint in the same direction, toward a future in which pricing will be increasingly dynamic and supported by a wealth of information and sophisticated algorithms.\n\n\n\nTime-consuming offline analyses will become increasingly irrelevant—their results will be obsolete before they can be completed because the world moves too quickly.\n\n\nSo concluded a pioneering study by McKinsey and Company, which concluded that a 1% improvement in profit would, on average, result in an improvement in operating profit of 11.1%. By contrast, 1% improvements in variable cost, volume, and fixed cost would produce operating improvements of 7.8%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively.\n\n\n2018 book gave an example of a case in which a 5% improvement in price would lead to a profit improvement of 50%, while 5% improvements in unit costs, sales volume, and fixed costs would lead to profit gains of 30%, 20%, and 11.5%, respectively\n\n\nFor this reason it is critical to distinguish between the list price of a good and its pocket price—that is, what a particular customer ends up actually paying.\n\n\nThe price waterfall was introduced by McKinsey and Company as a graphical way of illustrating the discounts that occur between the list price of a good and its pocket price.\n\n\nSmart buyers will quickly detect a disorganized or dispersed pricing organization and exploit it to their advantage.\n\n\nMarket-based pricing means different things in different contexts. In this book it refers to the practice of pricing based solely on the prices being offered by the competition.\n\n\nCustomer value should be the key driver of price.\n\n\n*The goal of pricing and revenue optimization is to provide the right price:\n\nFor every product\nTo every customer segment\nThrough every channel\nIn addition, the goal is to update those prices over time in response to changing market conditions.\n\n\n\nAnalyze alternatives. This activity is the one most widely identified with pricing and revenue optimization or revenue management. For many companies, it has historically involved the use of spreadsheets to compare pricing alternatives under different scenarios. Choose the best alternative. The choice of the best alternative requires a clear understanding of the goal for each price in the PRO cube—is it to maximize revenue or maximize price or some combination of the two? When many prices are changing quickly, an algorithm is typically required to solve the underlying optimization problem. Execute pricing. Finally, the prices that have been calculated need to be communicated to the market. This step is also referred to as pricing execution.\n\n\nSet goals and business rules. A key initial step in pricing and revenue optimization is to specify the overall goal of the process. Without a clear goal, it is impossible to make consistent decisions and to evaluate decisions in order to improve the process over time.\n\n\nFor many companies, pricing involves a complex set of decisions that is often poorly managed or unmanaged. In many cases, the pocket prices charged to customers are the result of a large number of uncoordinated and arbitrary decisions.\n\n\nMany of the approaches to calculating optimal prices in this book are based on a classic forecast-and-optimize approach in which we derive an explicit model of how we believe that demand will respond to the prices we offer and use the techniques of mathematical optimization to find the prices that best meet our objective function.\n\n\nIn the economics literature, determining the value that every customer places on a product and then charging them that value is called perfect third-degree price discrimination by a monopolist.\n\n\nPropensity to shop is related to the value that an individual places on personal time. Students and retirees are often found to be highly price sensitive—this can be explained in part by the relatively low opportunity cost of their time.\n\n\nAssume that we have a population of customers of size D. The number of customers who will purchase at a price p is equal to the number of customers whose willingness to pay for the product is greater than or equal to p. (For simplicity, we assume that if a customer’s willingness to pay is exactly equal to the price, she will purchase.) Define the function f(x) as the density function for willingness to pay across the population, and define D as the potential demand—the number of customers who are potentially interested in purchasing the product and are aware of its price. Then, for any price p,  is the fraction of the population with willingness to pay ≽ p, and the demand for the product at price p, which we denote d(p), can be written as\n\n\nOne of the advantages of Equation 3.1 is that it partitions the price-response function into a potential-demand component D and a willingness-to-pay component f(x). This is often a convenient way to model a market.\n\n\nDt in Equation 3.3 is a measure of potential demand while F̄(p) is the fraction of potential demand that converts to actual demand at price p.\n\n\nThe three most common measures for price sensitivity are slope, hazard rate, and elasticity.\n\nThe slope in the context of price sensitivity refers to the gradient of the demand curve. It measures the change in quantity demanded per unit change in price. A steeper slope implies more sensitivity to price changes since a small change in price leads to a significant change in quantity demanded or sold.\nThe hazard rate is often used in survival analysis but can also apply to understand how the probability of a sale (or no sale) changes with changes in price. It effectively measures the instantaneous risk of the desired outcome (e.g., purchase) happening at a particular price, assuming it has not yet occurred. This can help businesses optimize pricing over time.\nPrice elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of an item responds to a change in the price of that item. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. A higher elasticity means demand is more sensitive to price changes. Elasticities greater than one indicate high sensitivity (elastic demand), while those less than one indicate low sensitivity (inelastic demand).\n\n\n\nIn order to estimate these properties from data, we assume that we have observations of demand at two different prices d̂(p1) and d̂(p2). Here, the caret indicates that the demand is actually being observed from data rather than derived from a model.\n\n\nSome typical values that have been estimated for cross-price elasticities are .66 for butter and margarine and .28 for beef and pork (Frank 2015). This would suggest that a 1% increase in the price of butter would lead to a 0.66% increase in demand for margarine.\n\n\nA measure related to cross-price elasticity that is sometimes useful is the diversion ratio, which measures what fraction of the change in demand for product i that occurs with a change in product i’s price is borne by product j. That is, if we raise the price for product i, what fraction of the reduced demand for product i will translate into increased demand for product j?\n\n\nAxiom of completeness, which states that, given any two products A and B, a consumer either prefers A to B or prefers B to A or is indifferent between them. Another example is the axiom of transitivity, which states that if a consumer prefers A to B and prefers B to C, she must also prefer A to C.\n\n\nThis means that what we are selling is a good—something people are willing to buy—rather than an illth—something people are willing to pay to get rid of.\n\n\nA criticism of A/B tests is that they may be subject to the so-called Hawthorn effect, which occurs when the fact that the staff of a store know that it has been chosen for a test changes their behavior in a way that influences the outcome.\n\n\nIt is this rounding that provides the price discontinuity that can be exploited—a 1.249 surge would be rounded down to 1.2 while a 1.251 surge would be rounded up to 1.3. It is reasonable to assume that conditions (and the characteristics of customers) when the calculated surge is 1.249 should be almost the same as those when the calculated surge is 1.251, so the fact that one group got charged 1.2 and the other 1.3 is very close to a randomized experiment. By applying this methodology to a sample of 50 million UberX customers in Uber’s four largest cities, the company was able to estimate price elasticities, which fell largely between 0.4 and 0.6.\n\n\nGlance views, defined as customer visits to a product detail page. Amazon also provides marketplace sellers with their glance view conversion rates for each product, defined as the number of orders divided by the number of glance views. Information such as glance views, which we call potential demand, can be extremely valuable in enabling more accurate price-response estimates.\n\n\n*This model is called the champion. Once we have established an initial champion, we can determine a final model using a champion-challenger process, which proceeds in five steps:\n\n\n\nChoose a set of variables and variable transformations that has not been tried before.\nRun a regression using the variables, variable combinations, and variable transformations on the training set. The resulting model is called the challenger.\nMeasure the performance of the challenger on the test data. If the challenger performs better than the champion, then the challenger becomes the new champion. If the champion outperforms the challenger, then the champion remains the champion.\nGo to step 1 and continue until performance is no longer improving as new challengers are evaluated.\nOnce a final champion has been chosen, reestimate the coefficients of the model using all of the available data (training data and test data).\n\n\n\nThe lesson for price-response estimation is that all price-response regressions should be tested for endogeneity. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test is the most popular test and is available in most statistical packages,\n\n\nFinally, the ultimate cure for endogeneity, as for collinearity, is price testing. Data from a properly randomized price will be free from both collinearity and endogeneity.\n\n\nThe cost used in pricing and revenue optimization is the incremental cost of a customer commitment. It is the difference between the total costs a company would incur from satisfying the commitment versus not making it. The incremental cost will vary with the duration and size of the commitment and is not a fully allocated cost. A rule of thumb is that if a change in demand resulting from a change in price would not change the cost, then the cost should not be included in determining the price.\n\n\nPrice differentiation refers to the practice of a seller charging different prices to different customers, either for exactly the same good or for slightly different versions of the same good.\n\nSuccessful price differentiation allows sellers to increase profitability by charging different prices to customers with different willingness to pay.\nCannibalization, imperfect segmentation, or arbitrage can destroy—or even reverse—the benefits of price differentiation\n\n\n\n*Four criteria must hold for group pricing to be successful.\n\nThere must be an unambiguous indicator of group membership. Examples of such indicators include a student ID card or a driver’s license that lists age. Furthermore, it must be difficult or impossible for members of one group to masquerade as members of another. Otherwise, cannibalization could easily reduce or even erase the benefits of price differentiation.\nGroup membership must strongly correlate with price sensitivity. Senior citizen discounts are predicated on the knowledge that senior citizens, on average, are more price sensitive than the public in general.\nThe product or service cannot be easily traded among purchasers. This is necessary to avoid arbitrage, in which some customers with access to low prices resell to customers who are quoted higher prices.\nThe segmentation must be both culturally and legally accepted. Group pricing can be extremely controversial. Certain group pricing practices—setting different prices for different races, for example—are illegal in many jurisdictions. Other group pricing practices such as gender-based pricing may or may not be illegal\n\n\n\nRide-share operators typically set a time- and distance-based base rate for each trip. These base rates, which may vary by city, establish a minimum rider price and hence a minimum driver payment. However, most ride-sharing operators soon established dynamic pricing in which the rider price and driver price varied by time and by location.\n\n\nThe ride-sharing service typically knows the number of people in the area who have the app open—we denote that potential demand by D.\n\n\nOne question about dynamic pricing of this sort is whether it is good for customers. Note that, if a region is in a state of excess demand and prices are not increased, service quality will decrease: riders will see increased time to arrival for their ride or, in the extreme, that no cars are available. While an excess of demand may seem like a good situation for drivers, in actuality it is not. The increased arrival times mean that drivers are being sent from distant regions to satisfy the demand and are thus spending excessive time driving to pickups—time for which they do not get paid. Furthermore, the price has been kept low, so the result is lower driver payments per hour.\n\n\nWith multiple market segments, the optimal price can be found by solving a constrained-optimization problem. At the optimal price, the marginal revenue will be the same for all segments, but it will not be equal to marginal cost if the constraint is binding.\n\n\nA supply constraint has an associated total opportunity cost, defined as the additional operating profit the business could achieve if the supply constraint were eliminated. The marginal opportunity cost associated with a supply constraint is defined as the additional operating profit the seller would realize if one additional unit of supply were available.\n\n\nVirtual restaurant is one whose brand appears only online, although it may be tied to a differently named physical restaurant. A ghost kitchen is an establishment that exists only to serve the delivery market—there is no associated dining establishment. Confusingly, ghost kitchens are sometimes referred to as virtual restaurants.\n\n\nRevenue management (RM) (once called yield management) refers to the strategy and tactics used by a number of industries—notably the passenger airlines but also including hotels, rental cars, cruise lines, and others—to manage the allocation of their capacity to different fare classes over time in order to maximize revenue.\n\n\nRevenue management can be considered a special case of variable and dynamic pricing with constrained supply. However, the final two conditions give revenue management its special flavor. Revenue management is based not on setting and updating prices but directly on setting and updating the availability of fare classes, where each fare class has an associated fare (price) that remains constant through the booking period.\n\n\nThis is a prime revenue management sin—an airline cannot maximize revenue by rejecting high-fare customers to save seats for low-fare customers.\n\n\nSince almost 30% of airline bookings are canceled before departure, the booking management process at a passenger airline needs to update booking limits when cancellations occur.\n\n\nRevenue management needs to be implemented at three levels. At the strategic level, it requires identifying customer segments and creating virtual products and other ways of differentiating prices. At the booking-control level, it requires determining in real time whether or not booking requests should be accepted or rejected. At an intermediate level, tactical revenue management periodically recalculates and updates the booking limits used for booking controls.\n\n\n*Tactical revenue management consists of three interrelated problems:\n\nCapacity allocation: How should fare class booking limits be set for a single-resource product?\nNetwork management: How should bookings for multi-resource products be controlled?\nOverbooking: How many total bookings should be allowed for a resource?\n\n\n\n“Passengers do not come with Y-Class or M-Class stamped on their foreheads.” Rather, customers search for the best combination of fare and travel option that meets their needs. The\n\n\nThen the revenue opportunity metric (ROM) is the revenue actually achieved from that flight minus the revenue that would have been achieved under no revenue management expressed as a percentage of the total revenue opportunity.\n\n\nThe term “bid price” is unfortunate because it is easily confused with the idea of bidding in an auction. This is not the situation in revenue management usage—the bid price is the minimum price that a seller would accept for another unit of a resource (such as a seat on a flight). The closest concept in auction theory is the reserve price, which is the minimum amount a seller would accept for an item.\n\n\nBid price: the minimum price we should accept for a customer on a leg • Opportunity cost: the revenue we would gain from an additional seat on a leg • Displacement cost: the revenue we would lose if we had one seat less on a leg • Marginal value of the capacity constraint in the network linear program • Boundary between the highest closed and lowest open fare classes in a single-leg problem • Closed bucket boundary: boundary between the highest closed and lowest open buckets on a leg in a virtual nest\n\n\nNetwork management is an issue for any revenue management company that sells products consisting of a combination of two or more of the resources it controls.\n\n\nKey challenge in network management is the size and complexity of the problem. A large hub-and-spoke network may have millions of product–fare class combinations it needs to manage for future departures. The size and complexity of the problem is a major consideration in implementing solutions.\n\n\nAmerican Airlines estimated that about 50% of its reservations resulted in either a cancellation or a no-show (Smith, Leimkuhler, and Darrow 1992).\n\n\nWhen a passenger is bumped against her will, it is known as an involuntary denied boarding. In 1966, the Civil Aeronautics Board estimated that the involuntary denied-boarding rate was about 7.7 per 10,000 boarded passengers.\n\n\nOverbooking is applicable in industries with all the following three characteristics. • Capacity (or supply) is constrained and perishable, and bookings are accepted for use of future capacity. • Customers are allowed to cancel or not show. • The cost of denying service to a customer with a booking is relatively low.\n\n\nThis is a classic trade-off between exploration and exploitation; the challenge in using a data-driven approach in this setting is to experiment periodically by setting the booking limit artificially high for some departures to observe the pattern of shows and then use that information to set the optimal booking limits for future departures.\n\n\nTwo metrics that are used to measure the effectiveness of overbooking are the spoilage rate and the denied-service (or denied-boarding) rate. Spoilage measures the seats that could have been filled but were left empty as a result of a booking limit that was too low, and denied service measures the number of passengers who showed but were denied boarding on a flight because shows exceeded available capacity.\n\n\nNobody but a fungoid creature from another galaxy with no familiarity with earthly ways would ever pay list price for anything.\n\n\nThis chapter discusses the tactics behind markdown management. The point of markdown management is to determine the timing and magnitude of markdowns that move the inventory while maximizing revenue.\n\n\n*These examples show, from the seller’s point of view, markdown products typically share two characteristics:\n\nInventory (or capacity) is fixed.\nThe inventory must be sold by a certain out date or its value drops precipitously.\n\n\n\n*Three criteria are all required for a markdown opportunity to be present.\n\nThe item for sale must be perishable.\nThe supply must be limited.\nThe desirability of the item must hold constant or decrease as it approaches its perishability date.\n\n\n\nIn customized pricing, potential customers approach the seller, one by one, and the seller quotes each one a price. Often (but not always) each potential buyer wants something different—either a different bundle of products or services, a different quantity, or a different variation on a basic product.\n\n\nIn customized pricing, the seller can quote a different price for each request.\n\n\n*The customized-pricing modality has three characteristics that differentiate it from list pricing.\n\nCustomers approach the seller prior to seeing a final price. In the cases described above, the customer takes the initiative and describes what she wants to purchase prior to seeing the price.\nThe seller can quote a different price to each customer. The customized price can (and should) reflect the best information—including customer-specific information—that the seller has at that time. Of course, the seller will usually not have perfect information about the preferences of any individual customer or about competitive prices. But, as we will see, he can use statistical reasoning to increase his expected profitability for each bid.\nIn customized pricing, the seller can track lost business. In a customized-pricing situation, the seller will either win—that is, get the business—or lose. In some (but not all) situations, a losing seller can find out which of his competitors won the business. However, even when this information is not available, the buyer knows that a potential customer has inquired about his product and decided not to purchase. This is in contrast to list pricing, in which the seller can only observe how many units he sold—not how many customers considered buying his product but decided against it. This lost bid information is important because it can form the basis for statistical estimation of customer bid-response functions.\n\n\n\nHere, deal means a particular piece of business, which may be a single order or a contract to provide future products and services. Bid means the price we offer.\n\n\nWe could use bottom-up modeling to derive a bid-response function from our probability distributions based on how we believe our competitors will bid and the selection process we believe the buyer will use.\n\nWe could convene the people within the company who have knowledge of this particular deal, experience with the customer, understanding of the competition, and experience with similar bidding situations and derive a bid-response function based on their expert judgment. This approach is often used when a deal is particularly large, important, or unique.\nWe could use statistical estimation based on the historical patterns of wins and losses we have experienced with the same (or similar buyers) in similar past bidding situations.  We describe an approach that uses statistical analysis of prior bids to estimate an optimal price for each bid moving forward.\n\n\n\nCustomized pricing requires two steps: estimating the bid-response function and then optimizing to find the price that maximizes the expected contribution for each bid.\n\n\n*We can use historical information about bids won and lost at different prices to estimate a bid-response function if three conditions hold.\n\nThe historical record includes bids for similar products to similar customers.\nThe current market conditions and products being offered are similar to those in the historical record.\nThere is a sufficient number of bids in the historical record to estimate a statistically significant bid-response function.\n\n\n\nFor customized pricing, the independent variable is price and all of the characteristics of a particular deal, and the dependent variable is the won/lost indicator, which can be either 0 or 1. This means that we want to fit a function that incorporates information about each deal to predict a binary dependent value. This is a problem of binary or Bernoulli regression.\n\n\nThe bid-response function specification in Equation 13.10 has a drawback: estimating all the values of aijk and bijk requires running MLE independently for each cell in the PRO cube. However, reliable estimation of the parameters of the logit bid-response function requires at least 200 historical observations.\n\n\nConstraint 13.12 guarantees that the company will have at least a 75% probability of winning each bid to an online retailer.\n\n\nLet ρi(p) and fi(p) be the bid-response function and the contribution, respectively, for a particular deal, i. One way for the package express company to meet its market-share target would be to solve the constrained optimization problem subject to whenever it is bidding to an online retailer. (Bids to all other customers would still be unconstrained.) Constraint 13.12 guarantees that the company will have at least a 75% probability of winning each bid to an online retailer. If the unconstrained optimal price would result in a probability of winning the bid that was greater than 75%, the constraint will not make any difference—the optimal price will be the same.\n\n\nApproximations will suffice. Infeasibility. Business rules are usually applied for good reasons. However, there can be a dangerous tendency for business rules to accrue over time, particularly if obsolete rules are never removed.\n\n\nEffective customized pricing requires a disciplined business process both to calculate and administer prices and to ensure that the parameters of the bid-response functions are updated to capture changes in the market.\n\n\n*There are three core steps in the customized-pricing process.\n\nCalculate bid-response function. Using available information about the customer, the product (or products) she wishes to purchase, and the channel through which the request was received, the seller estimates how the probability of winning this customer’s business varies as a function of price. This requires retrieving (or calculating) the parameters of the bid-response function that apply to this particular combination of segment, channel, and product.\nCalculate deal contribution. The seller estimates the deal contribution function relating contribution from this deal to its price.\nDetermine optimal price. Combining the bid-response function and the deal contribution function, the seller calculates the price that maximizes expected contribution (or other goal) subject to applicable business rules.\n\n\n\nCustomized pricing occurs when customers approach a seller individually and describe their desired product (or products) prior to purchasing. Customized pricing is commonplace in business-to-business marketplaces as well as some consumer marketplaces, notably lending and insurance.\n\n\nMany behavioral studies have found effects of pricing that might be hard to use in the real world—for example, that customers are less sensitive to prices when the cents match their birthday\n\n\nEconomic theory allows for the possibility of Giffen goods, whose demand rises as their price rises because of substitution effects.\n\n\nProspect theory was introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 based on their observation that people do not evaluate opportunities based on a strict evaluation of expected costs and benefits. Rather, they use various mental shortcuts and rules of thumb to make decisions.\n\n\nDual entitlement. Dual entitlement postulates that consumers believe they are entitled to a “reasonable” price and firms are entitled to a “reasonable” profit.\n\n\nCustomers may prefer simple pricing to complex pricing, but they are not willing to pay for it. Customers praised the simplicity of value pricing, but when the time came to purchase a ticket, they bought from the airline that was offering the cheapest seat—not from the one offering the simplest fare structure.\n\n\nAlthough the idea of Giffen goods dates from the mid-nineteenth century, the first empirical evidence for a Giffen good in the real world—rice markets in Hunan Province in China—was not provided until the twenty-first century, although their claim is controversial. If Giffen goods do exist in the real world, they are quite rare and have little relevance to the practical problem of setting prices.\n\n\nOptimization is a mathematical operation on this model that produces values of decision variables—in our case, primarily prices or booking limits—that can then be applied in the real world. For applications such as pricing and revenue optimization, this is often called a forecast then optimize approach—we build a mathematical model that forecasts what we believe would happen for different decisions we could make (often with a probability distribution) and then use an optimization model to calculate the values of the decision variables that maximize our objective function.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/On-Food-and-Cooking":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/On-Food-and-Cooking","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Mich/On Food and Cooking.md","title":"On Food and Cooking","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","cooking","food","food-prep"],"content":"On Food and Cooking\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nOne of the most comprehensive and scientific books on cooking available. All the foods and their origins, their etymology and their scientific composition, are discussed. A stunningly through work, it gives the reader a lot of knowledge on the subject of food.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was quite a book to get through.\nI quite liked the etymology of the words; very interesting.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWhenever we cook we become practical chemists, drawing on the accumulated knowledge of generations, and transforming what the Earth offers us into more concentrated forms of pleasure and nourishment.\n\n\nBegan the gradual decline of the horses and the expansion of the deer family, the ruminants, which evolved the ability to survive on dry grass. Cattle, sheep, goats, and their relatives are all ruminants.\n\n\nThe key to the rise of the ruminants is their highly specialized, multichamber stomach, which accounts for a fifth of their body weight and houses trillions of fiber-digesting microbes, most of them in the first chamber, or rumen.\n\n\nThe immediate ancestor of Bos taurus, the common dairy cow, was Bos primigenius, the long-horned wild aurochs.\n\n\nMost traditional cattle breeds have been abandoned in favor of high-yielding black-and-white Friesian (Holstein) cows, which now account for 90% of all American dairy cattle and 85% of British.\n\n\nThe cows are farmed in ever larger herds and fed an optimized diet that seldom includes fresh pasturage, so most modern milk lacks the color, flavor, and seasonal variation of preindustrial milk.\n\n\nIn their roots, both milk and dairy recall the physical effort it once took to obtain milk and transform it by hand. Milk comes from an Indo-European root that meant both “milk” and “to rub off,” the connection perhaps being the stroking necessary to squeeze milk from the teat.\n\n\nIn medieval times, dairy was originally dey-ery, meaning the room in which the dey, or woman servant, made milk into butter and cheese.\n\n\nThanks to the rumen microbes, which convert the unsaturated fatty acids of grass and grain into saturated fatty acids, the milk fat of ruminant animals is the most highly saturated of our common foods. Only coconut oil beats it.\n\n\nThe first fluid secreted by the mammary gland is colostrum, a creamy, yellow solution of concentrated fat, vitamins, and proteins, especially immunoglobulins and antibodies.\n\n\nAccording to business legend, the American Gail Borden reinvented evaporated milk around 1853 after a rough transatlantic crossing that sickened the ship’s cows. Borden added large amounts of sugar to keep his concentrated milk from spoiling.\n\n\nFor sweetened condensed milk, the milk is first concentrated by evaporation, and then table sugar is added to give a total sugar concentration of about 55%. Microbes can’t grow at this osmotic pressure, so sterilization is unnecessary.\n\n\nPowdered or dry milk is the result of taking evaporation to the extreme. Milk is pasteurized at a high temperature; then about 90% of its water is removed by vacuum evaporation, and the remaining 10% in a spray drier\n\n\nCooking Sweetened Condensed Milk Because it contains concentrated protein and sugar, sweetened condensed milk will “caramelize” (actually, undergo the Maillard browning reaction.\n\n\nMilk foams are more fragile than egg foams and whipped cream, and are generally made immediately before serving, usually as a topping for coffee drinks.\n\n\nMilk owes its foaming power to its proteins, which collect in a thin layer around the pockets of air, isolate them, and prevent the water’s strong cohesive forces from popping the bubbles. Egg foams are also stabilized by proteins, while the foam formed by whipping cream is stabilized by fat.\n\n\nMilk foams are more fragile and short-lived than egg foams because milk’s proteins are sparse — just 3% of the milk’s weight, where egg white is 10% protein\n\n\nBecause the whey proteins are the critical stabilizers, milks that are fortified with added protein — usually reduced-fat and skim milks — are most easily foamed.\n\n\nFor sheer inventiveness with milk itself as the primary ingredient, no country on earth can match India.\n\n\nMilk contains roughly equal weights of protein and fat, while in cream fat outweighs protein by at least 10 to 1.\n\n\nfraîche: “fresh, cool, new.” In France, crème fraîche may be either “sweet” or cultured with lactic acid bacteria; in the United States, the term always means cultured, tart, thick cream.\n\n\nButter making is in essence a simple but laborious operation: you agitate a container of cream until the fat globules are damaged and their fat leaks out and comes together into masses large enough to gather.\n\n\nOriginal buttermilk, rich in free globule membrane material and with about 0.5% fat.\n\n\nIn France, for example, butter from Normandy is relatively soft and favored for spreading and making sauces — Elizabeth David said, “When you get melted butter with a trout in Normandy it is difficult to believe that it is not cream” — while butter from the Charentes is firmer, and preferred for making pastries.\n\n\nBecause its scant water is dispersed in tiny droplets, properly made butter resists gross contamination by microbes, and keeps well for some days at room temperature. However, its delicate flavor is easily coarsened by simple exposure to the air and to bright light, which break fat molecules into smaller fragments that smell stale and rancid.\n\n\nGhee (from the Sanskrit for “bright”) was born of necessity. Ordinary butter spoils in only ten days in much of the country, while the clarified fat keeps six to eight months.\n\n\nThe effect of salts on freezing was known in the 13th century Arab world.\n\n\nA distinct style of custard ice cream is the Italian gelato, which is typically high in butterfat as well as egg yolks, and frozen with little overrun into a very rich, dense cream.\n\n\nGenerally, premium-quality ice creams are made with more cream and egg yolks than less expensive types.\n\n\nYogurt and its relatives are native to a broad and climatically warm area of central and southwest Asia and the Middle East, an area that includes the probable home of dairying,\n\n\nYogurt is the Turkish word for milk that has been fermented into a tart, semisolid mass; it comes from a root meaning “thick.”\n\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the Russian Nobelist Ilya Metchnikov (who discovered that white blood cells fight bacterial infection) gave a scientific rationale to this belief, when he proposed that the lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks eliminate toxic microbes in our digestive system that otherwise shorten our lives.\n\n\nA distinctive subfamily among the cream cultures are the “ropy” milks of Scandinavia, so-called because they’re more than stringy: lift a spoonful of Finnish viili, Swedish långfil, or Norwegian tättemjölk, and the rest of the bowl follows it into the air.\n\n\nCheese is one of the great achievements of humankind.\n\n\nAnother remarkable fermented milk little known in the West is kefir, which is most popular in the Caucasus and may well have originated there. Unlike other fermented milks, in which the fermenting microbes are evenly dispersed, kefir is made by large, complex particles known as kefir grains, which house a dozen or more kinds of microbes, including lactobacilli, lactococci, yeasts, and vinegar bacteria.\n\n\nThe earliest good evidence of cheesemaking known to date, a residue found in an Egyptian pot, dates from around 2300 BCE.\n\n\nThe Ingredient Essential to Diverse Cheeses: Time\n\n\nThe crowning blow to cheese diversity and quality was World War II. In continental Europe, agricultural lands became battlefields, and dairying was devastated. During the prolonged recovery, quality standards were suspended, factory production was favored for its economies of scale and ease of regulation, and consumers were grateful for any approximation of the prewar\n\n\nSurrealist poet Leon-Paul Fargue is said to have honored Camembert cheese with the title les pieds de Dieu — the feet of God.\n\n\nThe standard garden variety molds come from the large and various genus Penicillium, which also gave us the antibiotic penicillin.\n\n\nBlue Molds Penicillium roqueforti, as its name suggests, is what gives sheep’s milk Roquefort cheese its veins of blue.\n\n\nRubbery, or crumbly curd into a delicious cheese. The French term for ripening, affinage, comes from the Latin finus, meaning “end” or “ultimate point,”\n\n\nHowever, France and Greece lead the world in per capita cheese consumption, at better than 2 oz/60 gm per day, about double the U.S. figures, yet they’re remarkable among Western countries for their relatively low rates of heart disease, probably thanks to their high consumption of heart-protective vegetables, fruits, and wine\n\n\nBecause any soft cheese contains enough moisture to permit the survival of various human pathogens, both pasteurized and unpasteurized versions are probably best avoided by people who may be especially vulnerable to infection\n\n\nThe egg is one of the kitchen’s marvels, and one of nature’s. Its simple, placid shape houses an everyday miracle: the transformation of a bland bag of nutrients into a living, breathing, vigorous creature\n\n\nThe Victorian Samuel Butler awarded the egg overall priority when he said that a chicken is just an egg’s way of making another egg.\n\n\nThanks to a dominant trait unknown in any other wild or domestic chickens, the rare Chilean Araucana lays blue eggs.\n\n\nThe yolk accounts for just over a third of a shelled egg’s weight, and its biological purpose is almost exclusively nutritive.\n\n\nDesigned as it was to protect itself for the duration of the chick’s development, the egg is unique among our raw animal foods in its ability to remain edible for weeks, as long as it’s kept intact and cool.\n\n\nCook all egg dishes sufficiently to kill any bacteria that might be present. This generally means holding a temperature of at least 140ºF/60ºC for 5 minutes,\n\n\nAcids and Salt Tenderize There’s no truth to the common saying that acidity and salt “toughen” egg proteins. Acids and salt do pretty much the same thing to egg proteins. They get the proteins together sooner, but they don’t let them get as close together.\n\n\nIt’s easy to tell whether an intact egg is raw or already cooked. Give it a spin on its side. If it spins fast and smoothly, it’s cooked. If it seems balky and wobbly, it’s raw — the liquid insides slip and slosh and resist the movement of the solid shell.\n\n\nCustard to mean a dish prepared and served in the same container, often baked and therefore unstirred, so that it sets into a solid gel.\n\n\nCrème brûlée (“burned cream”) is also a custard topped with caramel, but here the caramel should be hard enough to shatter when rapped with a spoon.\n\n\nRising is essential for soufflés and sponge cakes, but it is antithetical to the dense richness of cheesecake. Four basic strategies will minimize it. First, beat the ingredients slowly, gently, and only long enough to obtain an even mix. Vigorous or long beating incorporates more air bubbles that will fill with steam and expand during baking. Second, bake the cheesecake slowly in a low oven. This will allow trapped air and steam to disperse gradually and evenly. Third, don’t overbake. This will dry the filling and cause it to shrink from moisture loss. Finally, cool the cheesecake gradually in the open oven.\n\n\nPhysical agitation normally breaks down and destroys structure. But beat eggs and you create structure.\n\n\nSalt increases the whipping time and decreases the foam’s stability.\n\n\nSugar both hinders and helps foam making. Added early in the process, it delays foaming, and it reduces the foam’s ultimate volume and lightness. The delay comes from sugar’s interference with the unfolding and bonding of the proteins. And the reduction in volume and lightness is caused by the syrupy sugar-egg mixture being harder to spread into thin bubble walls. Slow foaming is a real disadvantage when the whites are whipped by hand — at standard soft-meringue levels, it doubles the work — but less so if you’re using a stand mixer. The helpful thing about sugar is that it improves the foam’s stability.\n\n\nThe linguist Otto Jänicke has traced the word meringue back to an alteration of the Latin word merenda, meaning “light evening meal,” into meringa, a form that was found in the Artois and Picardie near what is now Belgium.\n\n\nCharles’s law also means that what must go up in the oven must come down at the table. A balloon expands as its temperature rises, but shrinks again if its temperature falls.\n\n\nCharles’s law is this: all else equal, the volume occupied by a given weight of gas is proportional to its temperature.\n\n\nOur primate ancestors lived almost exclusively on plant foods until 2 million years ago, when the changing African climate and diminishing vegetation led them to scavenge animal carcasses.\n\n\nHumans became active hunters around 100,000 years ago, and it’s vividly clear from cave paintings of wild cattle and horses that they saw their prey as embodiments of strength and vitality.\n\n\nSome migratory birds put on 50% of their lean weight in fat in just a few weeks, then fly 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers from the northeast United States to South America without refueling.\n\n\nSalt pork was as much a staple food as bread (hence such phrases as “scraping the bottom of the barrel” and “pork-barrel politics”).\n\n\nToday, with one-fifteenth of the world’s population, the United States eats one-third of the world’s meat. Meat consumption on this scale is possible only in wealthy societies like our own, because animal flesh remains a much less efficient source of nourishment than plant protein.\n\n\nThe Saxons had their own Germanic names for the animals — ox, steer, cow, heifer, and calf; sheep, ram, wether, ewe, and lamb; swine, hog, gilt, sow, and pig — and named their flesh by attaching “meat of” to the animal name. When French became the language of the English nobility in the centuries following the Conquest, the animal names survived in the countryside, but the prepared meats were rechristened in the fashion of the court cooks: the first recipe books in English call for beef (from the French boeuf), veal (veau), mutton (mouton), and pork (porc).\n\n\nExactly because it is a nutritious material, meat is especially vulnerable to colonization by microbes, mainly bacteria. And because animal skins and digestive tracts are rich reservoirs of bacteria, it’s inevitable that initially clean meat surfaces will be contaminated during slaughter and the removal of skin, feathers, and innards.\n\n\nThe two most prominent causes of serious meat-borne illness are Salmonella and E. coli.\n\n\nMeat production is big business. In the United States just a few decades ago, it was second only to automobile manufacturing.\n\n\nLean meat is made up of three basic materials: it’s about 75% water, 20% protein, and 3% fat. These materials are woven into three kinds of tissue. The main tissue is the mass of muscle cells, the long fibers that cause movement when they contract and relax. Surrounding the muscle fibers is the connective tissue, a kind of living glue that harnesses the fibers together and to the bones that they move. And interspersed among the fibers and connective tissue are groups of fat cells, which store fat as a source of energy for the muscle fibers.\n\n\nOne, a protein called elastin for its stretchiness, is the main component of blood vessel walls and ligaments, and is especially tough; its cross-links cannot be broken by the heat of cooking.\n\n\nThe major connective-tissue filament is the protein called collagen, which makes up about a third of all the protein in the animal body, and is concentrated in skin, tendons, and bones. The name comes from the Greek for “glue producing,” because when it’s heated in water, solid, tough collagen partly dissolves into sticky gelatin\n\n\nWhy do chickens have both white and dark meat, and why do the two kinds of meat taste different? Why is veal pale and delicate, beef red and robust? The key is the muscle fiber. There are several different kinds of muscle fiber, each designed for a particular kind of work, and each with its own color and flavor.\n\n\nRed muscle fibers are used for prolonged efforts. They are fueled primarily by fat, whose metabolism absolutely requires oxygen, and obtain both fat (in the form of fatty acids) and oxygen from the blood. Red fibers are relatively thin, so that fatty acids and oxygen can diffuse into them from the blood more easily.\n\n\nFat cells, on the other hand, are essentially storage tissue, and any sort of fat-soluble material can end up in them.\n\n\nIn general, grass or forage feeding results in stronger-tasting meat than grain or concentrate feeding, thanks to the plants’ high content of various odorous substances, reactive polyunsaturated fatty acids, and chlorophyll, which rumen microbes convert into chemicals called terpenes, relatives of the aroma compounds in many herbs and spices\n\n\nLambs and sheep store a number of unusual molecules, including branched-chain fatty acids that their livers produce from a compound generated by the microbes in their rumen, and thymol, the same molecule that gives thyme its aroma.\n\n\nThe “piggy” flavor of pork and gamy flavor of duck are thought to come from intestinal microbes and their fat-soluble products of amino-acid metabolism,\n\n\nThe deep “beefy” flavor of beef, however, is more prominent in grain-fed animals.\n\n\nAnd the flavor carried in fat gets stronger as animals get older, as more of the flavor compounds are put into storage. This is why lamb is generally more popular than mutton from mature sheep.\n\n\nLife intensifies flavor, and modern meat animals are living less and less.\n\n\nCattle are our largest meat animals and take the longest to reach adulthood, about two years, so their meat is relatively dark and flavorful.\n\n\nJapan prizes its shimofuri, or highly marbled beef, of which the best known comes from the Kobe region. Steers of the native Wagyu draft breed are slaughtered at 24–30 months. High-quality heifers (and some steers) are identified and then fattened for a further year or more on grain.\n\n\nPigs are descendents of the Eurasian wild boar, Sus scrofa.\n\n\nIn China the word for “pork” is also the generic word for “meat.”\n\n\nGerman Kalikutische Hahn (“hen of Calicut,” an Indian port),\n\n\nThe turkey was first seen by the Spanish in Mexico around 1518, and they named it with variants on the word pavo, “pea fowl.” In most other European languages its early names referred to India: French dinde, dindon (d’Inde, “of India”), German Kalikutische Hahn (“hen of Calicut,” an Indian port), Italian pollo d’India (“fowl of India”).\n\n\nNovember 1979, the New York Times reported that a Finnish slaughterhouse had evicted a group of young musicians from a nearby building because their practice sessions were resulting in dark-cutting meat.\n\n\nHunt originally meant “to seize.”\n\n\nThe term venison comes from the Latin verb venari, “to hunt,” but ultimately from an Indo-European root meaning “to desire, to strive for,”\n\n\nFat Oxidation and Rancidity The most important chemical damage suffered by meats is the breakdown of their fats by both oxygen and light into small, odorous fragments that define the smell of rancidity. Rancid fat won’t necessarily make us sick, but it’s unpleasant, so its development limits how long we can age and store meat.\n\n\nUnsaturated fats are most susceptible to rancidity, which means that fish, poultry, and game birds go bad most quickly.\n\n\nBeef has the most saturated and stable of all meat fats, and keeps the longest.\n\n\nRefrigeration has two great advantages: it requires little or no preparation time, and it leaves the meat relatively unchanged from its fresh state.\n\n\nFreezing greatly extends the storage life of meat and other foods because it halts all biological processes. Life requires liquid water, and freezing immobilizes the food’s liquid water in solid crystals of ice.\n\n\nA last side effect of freezing is freezer burn, that familiar brownish-white discoloration of the meat surface that develops after some weeks or months of storage.\n\n\nHow cooking forces moisture from meat. Water molecules are bound up in the protein fibrils that fill each muscle cell. As the meat is heated, the proteins coagulate, the fibrils squeeze out some of the water they had contained and shrink.\n\n\nThe cook’s margin of error in cooking meat is narrower than it used to be. So it’s more useful than ever to understand how the various methods for cooking meat work, and how best to apply them to the meat of the 21st century.\n\n\nBacteria are on the meat surfaces, not inside.\n\n\nMany traditional meat recipes were developed at a time when meats came from mature, fatty animals, and so were fairly tolerant of overcooking.\n\n\nThe meats, typically poultry or pork, are immersed in a brine containing 3 to 6% salt by weight for anywhere from a few hours to two days (depending on thickness) before being cooked as usual. They come out noticeably juicier.\n\n\nBarbecuing is the low-temperature, slow heating of meat in a closed chamber by means of hot air from smoldering wood coals. It’s an outdoor cousin to the slow oven roast, and produces smoky, fall-apart tender meat.\n\n\nThe term barbecue comes via the Spanish barbacoa from the West Indies, and a Taino word that meant a framework of green sticks suspended on corner posts, on which meat, fish, and other foods were laid and cooked in the open over fire and coals.\n\n\nFats and oils are a useful cooking medium because they can be heated to temperatures well above the boiling point of water, and can therefore dry, crisp, and brown the food surface.\n\n\nIn fact, moisture loss is proportional to meat temperature, so the high heat of searing actually dries out the meat surface more than moderate heat does.\n\n\nMeats cooked in liquid should be allowed to cool in that liquid, and are best served at temperatures well below the cooking temperature, around 120ºF/50ºC.\n\n\nHot water is such an effective heat transmitter that it cooks flat tender cuts of meat very quickly.\n\n\nPoach is a medieval word from the French for the “pouch” of gently cooked egg white that forms around the yolk.\n\n\nBraise and stew are both 18th-century borrowings from the French, the first coming from a word for “coal,” and referring to the practice of putting coals under and atop the cooking pot, the second from étuve, meaning stove or heated room and so a hot enclosure.\n\n\nA moist, tender braise or stew results from the cook’s cumulative attention to several details of procedure. The most important rule: never let the meat interior get anywhere near the boil.\n\n\nKeep the meat as intact as possible to minimize cut surfaces through which fluids can escape. If the meat must be cut, cut it into relatively large pieces, at least an inch/2.5 cm on a side. Brown the meat very quickly in a hot pan so that the inside of the meat warms only slightly. This kills microbes on the meat surfaces, and creates flavor. Start the pot with meat and cooking liquid in a cold oven, the pot lid ajar to allow some evaporation, and set the thermostat to 200ºF/93ºC, so that it heats the stew to around 120ºF/50ºC slowly, over two hours. Raise the oven temperature to 250ºF/120ºC so that the stew slowly warms from 120ºF to 180ºF/80ºC. After an hour, check the meat every half hour, and stop the cooking when it is easily penetrated by the tines of a fork. Let the meat cool in the stew, where it will reabsorb some liquid. The liquid will probably need to be reduced by boiling to improve flavor and consistency. Remove the meat first.\n\n\nThere’s some evidence that microwaves are unusually effective at dissolving collagen into gelatin.\n\n\nLarge oven roasts should be allowed to rest on the countertop for at least a half hour before carving, not only to allow the “afterheat” to finish cooking the center (p. 153), but also to allow the meat to cool down, ideally to 120ºF/50ºC or so. (This may take well over an hour; some chefs allow for a rest period equal to the roasting time.\n\n\nWhenever possible, meat is carved across the grain of the muscle fibers to reduce the impression of fibrousness in the mouth and make the meat easier to chew. Carving knives should be kept sharp. Sawing away with a dull blade compresses the tissue and squeezes its delicious liquid away. Finally, remember that the saturated fats of beef, lamb, and pork are solid at room temperature, which means that they rapidly congeal on the plate.\n\n\nThe word meat is used most commonly to mean the limb-moving skeletal muscles of animals\n\n\nFoie gras is the “fat liver” of force-fed geese and ducks. It has been made and appreciated since Roman times and probably long before; the force-feeding of geese is clearly represented in Egyptian art from 2500\n\n\nIt’s a kind of living pâté, ingeniously prepared in the growing bird before it’s slaughtered. Constant overnourishment causes the normally small, lean, red organ to grow to 10 times its normal size and reach a fat content of 50 to 65%. The fat is dispersed in insensibly fine droplets within the liver cells, and creates an incomparably integrated, delicate blend of smoothness, richness, and savoriness.\n\n\nThe word sausage comes from the Latin for “salt,” and names a mixture of chopped meat and salt stuffed into an edible tube.\n\n\nSalt plays two important roles in the sausage: it controls the growth of microbes, and it dissolves one of the fiber filament proteins (myosin) out of the muscle fibers and onto the meat surfaces, where it acts as a glue to bind the pieces together.\n\n\nThe preservation of meat from biological spoilage has been a major challenge throughout human history. The earliest methods, which go back at least 4,000 years, were physical and chemical treatments that make meat inhospitable to microbes.\n\n\nNowadays, meat is dried by briefly salting it to inhibit surface microbes and then heating it in low-temperature convection ovens to remove at least two-thirds of its weight and 75% of its moisture (more than 10% moisture may allow Penicillium and Aspergillus molds to grow).\n\n\nBecause its flavor has been concentrated and its texture is interesting, dried meat remains popular. Modern examples include American jerky, Latin American carne seca, Norwegian fenalår and southern African biltong, whose textures can range from chewy to brittle.\n\n\nThese days the word confit is used loosely to describe just about anything cooked slowly and gently to a rich, succulent consistency:\n\n\nIt comes via the French verb confire, from the Latin conficere, meaning “to do, to produce, to make, to prepare.”\n\n\nAround 1800, a French brewer and confectioner named Nicolas Appert discovered that if he sealed food in a glass container and then heated the container in boiling water, the food would keep indefinitely without spoiling.\n\n\nCanned meat a century old has been eaten without harm, if also without much pleasure.\n\n\nBy 40,000 years ago the hunters of prehistoric Europe were carving salmon images and making the first hooks to catch river fish; and not long afterward, they ventured onto the ocean in boats.\n\n\nToday in the United States, all of the rainbow trout and nearly all of the catfish sold are farmed on land in various kinds of ponds and tanks. Norway pioneered the ocean farming of Atlantic salmon in large offshore pens in the 1960s; and today more than a third of the salmon eaten in the world is farmed in Europe and North and South America.\n\n\nAbout a third of the world warm-water shrimp harvest is cultured, mainly in Asia. In all, about 70 species are now farmed worldwide.\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential to the development and function of the brain and the retina, and it appears that an abundance in our diet helps ensure the health of the central nervous system in infancy and throughout life.\n\n\nFish owe their small, light bones, delicate connective tissue, and large, pale muscle masses to the fact that water is much denser than air. Fish can attain a neutral buoyancy — can be almost weightless — simply by storing some lighter-than-water oils or gas in their bodies.\n\n\nThe paleness of fish flesh results from water’s buoyancy and its resistance to movement\n\n\nBut water’s resistance to movement increases exponentially with the fish’s speed. This means that fish must develop very high power very quickly when accelerating. And so they devote most of their muscle mass to an emergency powerpack of fast-twitch white cells that are used only for occasional bursts of rapid movement.\n\n\nThe cold aquatic environment is also responsible for the notorious tendency of fish and shellfish to spoil faster than other meats. The cold has two different effects. First, it requires fish to rely on the highly unsaturated fatty acids that remain fluid at low temperatures: and these molecules are highly susceptible to being broken by oxygen into stale-smelling, cardboardy fragments. More importantly, cold water requires fish to have enzymes that work well in the cold, and the bacteria that live in and on the fish also thrive at low temperatures.\n\n\nThe enzymes and bacteria typical of our warm-blooded meat animals normally work at 100ºF/40ºC, and are slowed to a crawl in a refrigerator at 40ºF/5ºC. But the same refrigerator feels perfectly balmy to deep-water fish enzymes and spoilage bacteria.\n\n\nThere are exceptions, but most fish can be thought of as sheets of muscle tissue anchored with connective tissue and the backbone to a propulsive tail. The animals push water behind them, developing thrust by undulations of the whole body and flexing of the tail.\n\n\nBecause the motion for steady swimming comes mostly from the back end of the fish, the tail region contains more connective tissue than the head end, and seems more succulent.\n\n\nFew of us get the chance to enjoy the experience, but very fresh fish smell surprisingly like crushed plant leaves!\n\n\nThe strong smell that we readily identify as “fishy” is largely due to the saltwater-balancing compound TMAO\n\n\nFreshwater fish generally don’t accumulate TMAO, and crustaceans accumulate relatively little, so they don’t get as fishy as ocean fish.\n\n\nTMA on the surface can be rinsed off with tap water. And acidic ingredients — lemon juice, vinegar, tomatoes — help in two ways. They encourage the stale fragments to react with water and become less volatile; and they contribute a hydrogen ion to TMA and DMA, which thereby take on a positive electrical charge, bond with water and other nearby molecules, and never escape the fish surface to enter our nose.\n\n\nSalmon quality is thus at its peak as the fish approach the mouth of their home river, which is where commercial fishermen take them.\n\n\nOpinions vary on the relative qualities of wild and farmed salmon. Some professional cooks prefer the fattiness and more consistent quality of farm fish, while others prefer the stronger flavor and firmer texture of wild fish at their best.\n\n\nThe “cod icefish” family is a group of large, sedentary plankton-eaters that live in the cold deep waters off Antarctica. The best known of them is the fatty “Chilean sea bass,” an inaccurate but more palatable commercial name for the Patagonian toothfish\n\n\nNorwegians prize cod held in tanks at the market and killed to order just before cooking (blodfersk, or “blood-fresh”);\n\n\nFor most of the foods that we want to store fresh for a few days, the ordinary refrigerator is quite adequate. The exception to the rule is fresh fish, whose enzymes and microbes are accustomed to cold waters (p.\n\n\nThe familiar bite-sized morsels of raw fish and lightly salted and acidified rice are nigiri sushi, meaning “grasped” or “squeezed,” since the rice portion is usually molded by hand.\n\n\nSushi chefs take great care to avoid contamination of the fish. They use a solution of cold water and chlorine bleach to clean surfaces between preparations, and they change cleaning solutions and cloths frequently during service.\n\n\nCeviche is an ancient dish from the northern coast of South America, in which small cubes or thin slices of raw fish are “cooked” by immersing them in citrus juice or another acidic liquid, usually with onion, chilli peppers, and other seasonings.\n\n\nKinilaw is the indigenous Philippine version of acid marination. Morsels of fish or shellfish are dipped for only a few seconds into an acidic liquid, often vinegar made from the coconut, nipa palm, or sugarcane, to which condiments have been added.\n\n\nIn the case of “jumping salad,” tiny shrimp or crabs are sprinkled with salt, doused with lime juice, and eaten alive and moving.\n\n\nThe Hawaiian islands have contributed poke (“slice,” “cut”) and lomi (“rub,” “press,” “squeeze”).\n\n\nCooked fish fall into four broad flavor families. Saltwater white fish are the mildest. Freshwater white fish have a stronger aroma thanks to their larger repertoire of fatty-acid fragments and traces of earthiness from ponds and tanks. Freshwater trout have characteristic sweet and mushroomy aromas. Salmon and sea-run trout, thanks to the carotenoid pigments that they accumulate from ocean crustaceans, develop fruity, flowery aromas and a distinctive family note (from an oxygen-containing carbon ring). Tuna, mackerel, and their relatives have a meaty, beefy aroma.\n\n\nJapanese scientists have found that certain ingredients help reduce the odor, apparently by limiting fatty-acid oxidation or preemptively reacting with TMAO: these include green tea and such aromatics as onion, bay, sage, clove, ginger, and cinnamon, which may also mask the fishy smell with their own.\n\n\nThe classic Japanese version of fried fish is fish tempura, a preparation and term that were borrowed in the late 16th century from Portuguese and Spanish missionaries who cooked fish during fasting seasons (tempora means “period of time”).\n\n\nAll crustaceans share the same basic body plan, which can be divided roughly into two parts. The forward portion, or cephalothorax, often called the “head” in shrimp, is the equivalent of our head and trunk put together. It includes the mouth, sensing antennae and eyes, five pairs of manipulating and crawling appendages, and the main organs of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and reproductive systems. The rear portion, or abdomen, usually called the “tail,” is mostly a large, meaty block of swimming muscle that moves the fin-like plates at the back end. The major exception to this body plan is the crab, which seldom swims; its abdomen is a thin plate folded up underneath a greatly enlarged cephalothorax.\n\n\nMost of the shellfish we eat are creatures from one of two groups, the crustaceans and the molluscs.\n\n\nCrustaceans are the shellfish that have legs and sometimes claws: shrimps and prawns, lobsters and crayfish, and crabs.\n\n\nThere were primitive shrimps 200 million years ago; today there are some 38,000 crustacean species, the largest with a claw span of 12 feet/4 meters!\n\n\nThe forward part of the crustacean body, the cephalothorax or “head,” contains the digestive and reproductive organs. The rear part, the abdomen or “tail,” is mainly fast muscle tissue that moves the rear fins and propels shrimp\n\n\nAs a crustacean grows, it must periodically cast off the old cuticle and create a larger new one. This process is called molting.\n\n\nMolting means that the quality of crustacean flesh is highly variable, and this is why wild harvests are seasonal, with the seasons depending on the particular animal and location\n\n\nShrimp comes from the Indo-European root skerbh, meaning to turn, bend, or shrink, perhaps reflecting the curled shape of these creatures.\n\n\nThe near-synonym prawn first appears in medieval times, and its origins are unknown.\n\n\nCrab and crayfish both derive from the Indo-European gerbh, meaning to scratch or carve, something that crustacean claws readily do to human skin.\n\n\nLobster shares with locust the Indo-European root lek, meaning to leap or fly: a remarkably early recognition of the family resemblance of crustaceans and insects.\n\n\nCrustacean itself comes from an Indo-European root meaning to freeze, to form a crust, and describes the hard outer skeleton of these creatures. It shares this root with crystal.\n\n\nThis highly successful and diverse branch of the animal kingdom got its start half a billion years ago and currently includes 100,000 species, double the number of fish and animal species with backbones, from snails just a millimeter across to giant clams and squids.\n\n\nThe secret to the molluscs’ success — and their strangeness — is their adaptable body plan. It includes three major parts: a muscular “foot” for moving; an intricate assembly that includes the circulatory, digestive, and sexual organs; and enveloping this assembly, a versatile sheet-like “mantle” that takes on such jobs as secreting materials for a shell, supporting eyes and small tentacles that detect food or danger, and contracting and relaxing to control water flow into the interior.\n\n\nAbalones, the most primitive, have one cup-like shell for protection, and a massive, tough muscular foot for moving along and clinging to the seaweed on which their rasping mouths feed.\n\n\nAll the bivalves — clams, mussels, oysters — have comb-like gills for filtering food particles from the water that the mantle draws in and expels. Mussels are also two-shelled filter feeders, but they attach their foot permanently to intertidal and subtidal rocks. They have no need for a siphon, and one of their tough shell-closing muscles is much reduced. Oysters cement themselves to inter- and sub-tidal rocks. Their two heavy shells are closed by a single large muscle at their center, around which the mantle and other organs are organized. The bulk of their body is the tender mantle and food-trapping gills. Scallops neither attach nor bury themselves. They lie free on the ocean floor, and escape predators by swimming. Their massive central muscle claps their shells\n\n\nThe immobile molluscs do very well in aquaculture. They can be raised in large numbers in the water’s three dimensions, suspended in nets or on ropes, and grow rapidly thanks to the good circulation of oxygen and nutrients.\n\n\nBecause shellfish use amino acids to counteract salt concentration, the saltier the water, the more savory the shellfish.\n\n\nClams and relatives often benefit from several hours’ immersion in a bucket of cold salt water (1/3 cup salt per gallon, or 20 gm/l) to clean themselves of residual sand and grit.\n\n\nWhen the cook wants to “shuck” an oyster or clam, or open the shell and remove the raw meat, it’s the hinge ligament and adductor muscles that must be dealt with.\n\n\nThe U.S. term “hard shell” is applied to sturdy clams that close completely (little-neck, quahog), while “soft shell” clams have siphons much longer than the shell, which is thin and always gapes (steamer, longneck).\n\n\nAbalone entered English via Spanish from the Monterey Indian word for this streamlined snail, aulun.\n\n\nClam began in the Indo-European gel, a compact mass: cloud, cling, and clamp are its linguistic relatives. Mussel derives from the Indo-European mus, meaning both “mouse” and “muscle,” which moves quickly like a mouse under the skin.\n\n\nOyster, from the Indo-European ost, “bone,” names the mollusc with the heavy and bone-colored shell. Scallop, with its unusually symmetrical and patterned valves, comes via the Middle French escalope, from a Germanic word for “shell.”\n\n\nAnd squid? To date, the linguists are stumped. It appeared out of nowhere in the 17th century.\n\n\nMussels are the easiest molluscs to prepare; they tolerate some overcooking and readily come off the shell.\n\n\nOysters became scarce as early as the 17th century, and are now largely farmed.\n\n\nThe greater the salinity of the water, the more taste-active amino acids the oyster’s cells must contain to balance the dissolved salt outside, and so the more savory its flavor.\n\n\nGravlax originated in medieval Scandinavia as a lightly salted, pressed form of salmon that was preserved by fermentation (p. 235) and had a strong smell.\n\n\nFish pastes and sauces are two phases of the same simple preparation. A mass of fish or shellfish is mixed with salt to give an overall salt concentration between 10% and 30%, and sealed in a closed container for from one month (for pastes) to 24 months (for sauces). Fish pastes tend to have relatively strong fish and cheese notes, while the more thoroughly transformed fish sauces are more meaty and savory.\n\n\nOne notorious example is Swedish Surstrømming. Herring are fermented in barrels for one to two months, then sealed in cans and allowed to continue for as much as another year. The cans swell, which is normally a warning sign for the growth of botulism bacteria, but for surstrømming a sign of promising flavor development. The unusual bacteria responsible for ripening in the can are species of Haloanaerobium, which produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, hydrogen sulfide, and butyric, propionic, and acetic acids: in effect a combination of rotten eggs, rancid Swiss cheese, and vinegar, overlaid onto the basic fish flavor!\n\n\nKatsuobushi is to the Japanese tradition what a concentrated veal stock is to the French: a convenient flavor base for many soups and sauces.\n\n\nFor the basic broth called dashi, cold water is brought just to the boil with a piece of kombu seaweed, which is then removed. The katsuobushi shavings are added, the liquid brought again to the boil, and poured off the shavings the moment they absorb enough water to fall to the bottom.\n\n\nOf all foods from the waters, the most expensive and luxurious are fish eggs. Caviar, the salted roe of the sturgeon, is the animal kingdom’s truffle:\n\n\nThough the term caviar is now widely used to describe any sort of lightly salted loose fish eggs, for many centuries it referred only to loose sturgeon eggs.\n\n\nPlants are independent autotrophs, while animals are parasitic heterotrophs. (Parasitism may not sound especially admirable, but without it there would be no need to eat and so none of the pleasures of eating and cooking!\n\n\nPlants are essentially stationary chemical factories, made up of chambers for carbohydrate synthesis and carbohydrate storage, and tubes to transfer chemicals from one part of the factory to another, with structural reinforcement — also mainly carbohydrates — to provide mechanical rigidity and strength.\n\n\nA partial list of their chemical warfare agents would include irritating compounds like mustard oil, hot-chilli capsaicin, and the tear-inducing factor in onions; bitter and toxic alkaloids like caffeine in coffee and solanine in potatoes; the cyanide compounds found in lima beans and many fruit seeds; and substances that interfere with the digestive process, including astringent tannins and inhibitors of digestive enzymes.\n\n\nWe’ve managed to learn which irritating warning signals are relatively harmless, and have come to enjoy sensations whose actual purpose is to repel us. Hence our seemingly perverse love of mustard and pepper and onions. This is the essential appeal of herbs and spices,\n\n\nLife arose about 4 billion years ago, but flowering plants have been around for only about 200 million years, and dominant for the last 50 million.\n\n\nVegetable comes from the Latin verb vegere, meaning to invigorate or enliven. Fruit, on the other hand, comes from Latin fructus, whose cluster of related meanings includes gratification, pleasure, satisfaction, enjoyment.\n\n\nHerbs come from green parts of plants, usually leaves — parsley, thyme, basil — while spices are generally seeds, bark, underground stems — black pepper, cinnamon, ginger\n\n\nThe word spice came from the medieval Latin species, which meant “kind of merchandise.”\n\n\nDespite the fact that we consider them vegetables, capsicum “peppers,” pea pods, cucumbers, and even corn kernels are actually fruits: plant parts that originate in the flower’s ovary and surround one or more seeds.\n\n\nThere are 300,000 edible plant species on earth, and perhaps 2,000 that are cultivated to some extent.\n\n\nFiber is defined as the material in our plant foods that our digestive enzymes can’t break down into absorbable nutrients.\n\n\nOrgans There are six major plant organs: the root, the stem, the leaf, the flower, the fruit, and the seed.\n\n\nSome leaves are as much as 70% air by volume. This structure helps explain why leafy vegetables shrink so much when cooked: heat collapses the spongy interior.\n\n\nThe earth is painted green with chlorophylls, the molecules that harvest solar energy and funnel it into the photosynthetic system that converts it into sugar molecules.\n\n\nCarotenoids are so named because the first member of this large family to be chemically isolated came from carrots. These pigments absorb blue and green wavelengths and are responsible for most of the yellow and orange colors in fruits and vegetables\n\n\nAnthocyanins (from the Greek for “blue flower”) are responsible for most of the red, purple, and blue colors in plants, including many berries, apples, cabbage, radishes, and potatoes.\n\n\nSugar is the main product of photosynthesis, and its sweetness is the main attraction provided by fruits for their animal seed dispersers.\n\n\nThe average sugar content of ripe fruit is 10 to 15% by weight.\n\n\nThese phenolics are called tannins because they have been used since prehistory to tan animal hides into tough leather by bonding with the skin proteins.\n\n\nFruits are more acidic than vegetables, so they’re resistant to many bacteria but more readily attacked by yeasts and molds\n\n\n“One rotten apple spoils the barrel”: moldy fruit or vegetables should be discarded and refrigerator drawers and fruit bowls should be cleaned regularly to reduce the microbial population.\n\n\nPractically, this means it’s best to keep plant foods in restricted spaces — plastic bags, or drawers within a refrigerator — to slow down moisture loss to the compartment as a whole and to the outside. At the same time, living produce exhales carbon dioxide and water, so moisture can accumulate and condense on the food surfaces, which encourages microbial attack. Lining the container with an absorbent material — a paper towel or bag — will delay condensation.\n\n\nTechnique sometimes called “sweating” (Italian soffrito or Catalan soffregit, both meaning “underfrying”): the very slow cooking over low heat of finely chopped vegetables coated with oil, to develop a flavor base for a dish featuring other ingredients.\n\n\nItaly, which gave us the term sorbet (via sorbetto from the Arabic sharab, or “syrup”).\n\n\nThe Greek term for quinces packed in honey, melimelon, gave us the word marmalade\n\n\nOur word root comes from an Indo-European word that meant both “root” and “branch.”\n\n\nPatata, a version of the word used by the Taino peoples of the Caribbean for the sweet potato, batata.\n\n\nPotato came into English via the Spanish patata, a version of the word used by the Taino peoples of the Caribbean for the sweet potato, batata.\n\n\nWhen onions and their relatives are heated, the various sulfur compounds react with each other and with other substances to produce a range of characteristic flavor molecules. The cooking method, temperature, and medium strongly affect the flavor balance.\n\n\nOnion itself comes from the Latin for “one,” “oneness,” “unity,” and was the name given by Roman farmers to a variety of onion (cepa\n\n\nGarlic is an Anglo-Saxon word that meant “spear-leek”: a leek with a slim, pointed leaf blade rather than a broad, open one.\n\n\nAnd both shallot and scallion come via Latin from Ashqelon, the Hebrew name for a city in what in classical times was southwest Palestine.\n\n\nCelery is often combined with carrots and onions in gently fried aromatic base preparations for other dishes (French mirepoix, Italian soffrito, Spanish sofregit; in the Louisiana Cajun “trinity” of aromatics the carrots are replaced by green capsicums\n\n\nToday’s mild, widely popular lettuces, varieties of the species Lactuca sativa, derive from an inedibly bitter weedy ancestor, L. serriola, that grew in Asia and the Mediterranean and has been under cultivation and improvement for 5,000 years.\n\n\nKale, collards, and cauliflower, have names that derive from the Latin word caulis, meaning “stem” or “stalk,”\n\n\nCabbage itself comes from the Latin caput, meaning “head”:\n\n\nArtichoke: The name is a corruption, via Italian, of the Arabic al’ qarshuf, meaning “little cardoon”;\n\n\nToday, after their domestication in Mexico (their name comes from the Aztec term for “plump fruit,” tomatl),\n\n\nOlives are the small fruits of Olea europaea, a remarkably hardy, drought-tolerant tree that’s native to the eastern Mediterranean region, and that can live and bear for a thousand years.\n\n\nAncient Greek name elaia is the source of the English oil (and Italian olio, French huile).\n\n\nMore oil, but of lesser quality, is extracted by pressing repeatedly and by heating the paste; oil extracted in the “first cold pressing” is the most delicate and stable, and most likely to yield “extra virgin” oil\n\n\nIn 1908 a Japanese chemist, Kikunae Ikeda, found that kombu is an especially rich source of monosodium glutamate — in fact it forms crystals on the surface of dried kombu. He also found that MSG provides a unique, savory taste sensation, different from the standard sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. He named this sensation umami (a rough translation is “delicious”), and pointed out that other foods, including meats and cheese, also provide it.\n\n\nInflated by water as they are, mushrooms are 80–90% water, with a thin outer cuticle that allows rapid moisture loss and gain.\n\n\nMushrooms can be cooked in many different ways. Their flavor is generally most developed and intense when they are cooked slowly with dry heat to allow enzymes some time to work before being inactivated, and to cook out some of their abundant water and concentrate the amino acids, sugars, and aromas.\n\n\nOur word ripe began as an Old English word meaning “ready for reaping,” and like reap comes ultimately from an Indo-European root meaning “to cut.” River, rope, row, and rigatoni are all relatives.\n\n\nClimacteric can be traced back to a root meaning “to lean,” which led to the Greek climax, “ladder,”\n\n\nPears are sensitive to carbon dioxide, so they shouldn’t be enclosed in plastic bags at any stage.\n\n\nEurope had its own native strawberry (F. vesca and F. moschata), which is now called the “wild” strawberry or fraise de bois(“woodland strawberry”), even though it’s cultivated.\n\n\nBerry comes from an Indo-European root meaning “to shine,” perhaps for the bright colors of many small fruits.\n\n\nThe straw in strawberry comes from a root for “to spread, to strew.”\n\n\nDate comes from the Greek word for “finger,” daktulos,\n\n\nPomegranate comes from medieval French, and is a combination of Latin roots meaning “apple” and “grainy” or “seedy.”\n\n\nOrange comes ultimately from the Sanskrit word for the fruit\n\n\nBlood oranges owe the deep maroon color of their juice to anthocyanin pigments, which develop only when night temperatures are low, in the Mediterranean autumn and winter.\n\n\nDurian Durian is the large, thorn-covered fruit of a tree, Durio zibethinus, that’s a native of Southeast Asia and cultivated mainly in Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n\n\nBanana comes from several West African languages, mango from south Indian Tamil, papaya from Carib, durian from Malay (a word meaning “thorn”).\n\n\nAnanas comes from a Guarani Indian word for the fruit; pineapple from the Spanish piña due to its resemblance to the similarly composite pinecone.\n\n\nWhat makes herbs and spices not only nontoxic and edible but delicious is a simple principle of cooking: dilution.\n\n\nThe flavorful material in an herb or spice is traditionally called its essential oil. The term reflects an important practical fact: aroma chemicals are more similar to oils and fats than they are to water, and are therefore more soluble in oil than they are in water\n\n\nBecause they come from warm climates, basil and perilla suffer chilling injury in the refrigerator and so are best kept at room temperature, with freshly cut stems immersed in water.\n\n\nCareful chopping with a sharp knife leaves much of the herb structure intact to provide fresh flavor while minimizing cell damage to the cut edges; by contrast, a dull knife crushes rather than cuts, bruises a wide swath of cells, and can result in rapid brown-black discoloration.\n\n\nOils and fats dissolve more aroma molecules than water during cooking, but also hang on to them during eating, so that their flavor appears more gradually and persists longer.\n\n\nIndian cooks also aromatize some dishes with a remarkable combination of smoking and spicing called dhungar. They put the dish into a pot along with a hollowed onion or small bowl that contains a live coal, sprinkle the coal with ghee and sometimes spices, and cover the pot tightly to infuse the dish with the fumes.\n\n\nThyme Thyme got its name from the Greeks, who used it as an aromatic in their burnt sacrifices; it shares its root with the words for “spirit” and “smoke.”\n\n\nCoriander Coriander or cilantro is said to be the most world’s most widely consumed fresh herb.\n\n\nParsley Parsley is a native of southeast Europe and west Asia; its name comes from the Greek and means “rock celery.”\n\n\nCapers Capers are the unopened flower buds of a Mediterranean bush, Capparis spinosa, which have been gathered from the wild and pickled for thousands of years, though cultivated only for a couple of centuries.\n\n\nKaffir” is Arabic for “unbeliever” and has derogatory connotations).\n\n\nMustard seed has been found in prehistoric sites from Europe to China, and was the first and only native pungent spice available to early Europe.\n\n\nSaffron is the world’s most expensive spice: a testament not only to the labor required to produce it, but to its unique ability to impart both an unusual flavor and an intense yellow color to foods.  The name comes from the Arabic for “thread.”\n\n\nToday Iran and Spain are the major producers and exporters. They use saffron in their respective rice dishes, pilaf and paella; the French in their fish stew, bouillabaisse; the Italians in risotto milanese; the Indians in biryanis and milk sweets.\n\n\nIt takes about 70,000 crocus flowers to produce 5 lb/2.25 kg of stigmas, the three dark red ends of the tube (“style”) that carries pollen down to the plant’s ovary. These 5 pounds in turn dry down to about 1 lb/450 gm of saffron.\n\n\nAnd because they’re so delicate, the stigmas are still harvested and separated from the other flower parts by hand, with nearly 200 hours of labor required for that same 1 pound of dried\n\n\nAnd because they’re so delicate, the stigmas are still harvested and separated from the other flower parts by hand, with nearly 200 hours of labor required for that same 1 pound of dried saffron.\n\n\nCardamom Cardamom is the world’s third most expensive spice after saffron and vanilla.\n\n\nThe word comes from an Arabic root meaning “to warm”; and cardamom has a delicate, warming quality due to two different sets of aromatics, both stored in a layer just below the seed surface:\n\n\nToday the Nordic countries consume 10% of world trade, mainly in baked goods, while Arab countries take 80% for their cardamom coffee.\n\n\nGahwa is made by boiling together freshly roasted and ground coffee with freshly broken green cardamom pods.\n\n\nA surprisingly large fraction of the ginger trade goes to Yemen, where it is added to coffee (as much as 15% of the coffee’s weight).\n\n\nIn the United States, the main use of turmeric is to provide color and nonpungent filler in prepared mustards.\n\n\nVanilla Vanilla is one of the most popular flavorings in the world. Among the spices it’s unique for the richness, depth, and persistence of its flavor.\n\n\nThe first Europeans to taste vanilla were the Spanish, who gave it its name; vainilla is the Spanish diminutive for “sheath” or “husk” (from the Latin vagina).\n\n\nTea leaves and coffee beans have one defense in common, and that’s caffeine, a bitter alkaloid that has significant effects on our bodies.\n\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed behavior-modifying chemical in the world.\n\n\nAnd very pure distilled water gives a brew best described as flat, with a missing dimension of flavor.\n\n\nThough it has lent its name to many other infusions, tea — from the Chinese word cha — is a drink prepared from the green leaves of a kind of camellia.\n\n\nBuddhist monks who valued tea as an aid to long hours of study found that tea itself was worthy of their contemplation. They developed the formal tea ceremony, which remains remarkable for the attention it pays to the simplest of preparations, an infusion of leaves in water.\n\n\nToday about three-quarters of the tea produced in the world is black tea. China and Japan still produce and drink more green tea than black.\n\n\nOolong Tea Oolong tea is made by allowing some modest enzyme transformation of leaf juices.\n\n\nOur word coffee comes from the Arabic qahwah, whose own origin is unclear.\n\n\nToday Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the largest exporters of coffee; African countries contribute about a fifth of world production.\n\n\nAround 1750, the French came up with the most important advance before espresso: the drip pot, in which hot water was poured onto a bed of grounds and allowed to pass through into a separate chamber. This invention did three things: it kept the temperature of the extracting water below the boil, it limited the contact time between water and ground coffee to a matter of a few minutes, and it produced a sedimentless brew that would keep for a while without getting stronger.\n\n\nThat was Italian espresso, a word which means something made at the moment it’s ordered, rapidly, and for one customer.\n\n\nCoffea arabica, a 15 ft/5 m tree that is native to the cool highlands of Ethiopia and the Sudan, produces what are known as “arabica” beans; and Coffea canephora, a larger tree native to hotter, more humid West Africa, produces “robusta” beans.\n\n\nAbout two-thirds of the beans in international trade are arabicas, which develop a more complex and balanced flavor than the robustas.\n\n\nThe Development of Coffee Flavor The hotter the bean is roasted, the darker it gets, and its color is a good indicator of flavor balance.\n\n\nServing and Holding Coffee Freshly brewed coffee is best enjoyed immediately — its flavor is evanescent. The ideal drinking temperature is around 140ºF/ 60ºC, where a sip won’t scald the mouth, and the coffee’s full aroma comes out.\n\n\nThe cereals (from Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture) are plants in the grass family, the Gramineae, whose members produce edible and nutritious seeds, the grains.\n\n\nLegumes The legumes (from the Latin legere, “to gather”) are plants in the bean family, the Leguminosae, whose members bear pods that contain several seeds.\n\n\nNuts The nuts (from an Indo-European root meaning “compressed”\n\n\nSeeds are generally dry, with only about 10% of their weight coming from water.\n\n\nBecause most of the seeds we eat are designed to survive a dormant, dry period, they are the easiest food ingredients to store.\n\n\nMajor Eurasian cereals — wheat, barley, rye, and oats — originally grew wild in extensive stands on the temperate high plains of the Near East.\n\n\nThe endosperm (from the Greek: “within the seed”) is often the only part of the grain consumed.\n\n\nMuesli is a simple mixture of thinly rolled grains, sugar, dried fruits, and nuts.\n\n\nOur word “cereal” comes from the Roman goddess of the fields, Ceres, whose name came in turn from an Indo-European root, ker, that meant “to grow”; the same root also led to “create,” “increase,” and “crescent.”\n\n\nBhares was the word for “barley” and also gave us “barn”; wrughyo meant “rye.” “Wheat” came from the same root that gives us “white” (kweit), apparently because its flour was light in color; and “oat” came from oid, “to swell.”\n\n\nEinkorn wheat, T. monococcum, was rediscovered in the early 1970s in the Vaucluse region of France and the southern Alps, where it was being grown to make a local porridge. It was probably the first wheat to be cultivated, around 10,000 years ago.\n\n\nItalian risotto rices and Spanish paella rices are medium-grain japonicas.\n\n\nMost Chinese and Indian rices are long-grain indicas, as is most of the rice sold in the United States.\n\n\nSticky rice, also called waxy, glutinous, or sweet rice, is a short-grain type whose starch is practically all amylopectin\n\n\nRice flour is notable for being around 90% starch, and for having the smallest starch granules of the major cereals, a half to a quarter the size of wheat starch granules.\n\n\nBeans and peas belong to the third largest family among the flowering plants (after the orchid and daisy families), and the second most important family in the human diet, after the grasses.\n\n\nEveryone produces a mixture of gases from their intestine, about a quart a day, thanks to the growth and metabolism of our resident bacteria. Many legumes, especially soy, navy, and lima beans, cause a sudden increase in bacterial activity and gas production a few hours after they’re consumed.\n\n\nEveryone produces a mixture of gases from their intestine, about a quart a day, thanks to the growth and metabolism of our resident bacteria. Many legumes, especially soy, navy, and lima beans, cause a sudden increase in bacterial activity and gas production a few hours after they’re consumed. This is because they contain large amounts of carbohydrates that human digestive enzymes can’t convert into absorbable sugars. These carbohydrates therefore leave the upper intestine unchanged and enter the lower reaches, where our resident bacterial population does the job we are unable to do.\n\n\nIn Egypt, the popular dish called ful medames is made by boiling the mature beans until soft, then flavoring with salt, lemon juice, oil, and garlic.\n\n\nThe use of the common bean in Peru was predated by the larger lima bean — the name derives from Peru’s capital —\n\n\nHoisin sauce, ha-hsien chiang, made from the residue of soy-sauce making, mixed with wheat flour, sugar, vinegar, chilli pepper; served with Peking duck and mu shu pork\n\n\nNew Japanese name, miso — mi meaning flavor — was given to distinctive Japanese versions of the paste.\n\n\nOils are extracted from nuts by two different means. “Cold-pressed” or “expeller-pressed” nut oils are made by crushing the nut cells and forcing the oil out with mechanical pressure. The nuts get hot from the pressure and friction, but generally don’t exceed the boiling point. Solvent-extracted oils are made by dissolving the oil out of the crushed nuts with a solvent at temperatures around 300ºF/150ºC, then separating the oil from the solvent. They are more refined than pressed oils, having fewer of the trace compounds that make oils both flavorful and potentially allergenic (p. 455). Cold-pressed oils are generally used as a flavoring, refined oils as cooking oils.\n\n\n“companion” and “company” from the late Latin companio, or “one who shares bread.”\n\n\nDough comes from an Indo-European root that meant “to form, to build,”\n\n\nThe word bread comes from a Germanic root, and originally meant a piece or bit of a loaf, with loaf meaning the leavened, baked substance itself.\n\n\nWhile the words for ground grain in French, Italian, and Spanish, farine and farina, come from the Latin for a kind of grain (far), the English word “flour” arose in medieval times from “flower,” meaning the best part of the ground grain:\n\n\nHe named this substance gluten, using the Latin word for “glue.” Gluten in turn came from an Indo-European root gel-¸ which gave rise to a number of words meaning to form into a ball, to make a coagulated lump, to be thick or sticky: these include cloud, globe, gluteus, clam, cling, and clay.\n\n\nMost flours are refined: that is, they have been sieved to remove the germ and bran layers from the particles of protein-and starch-rich endosperm.\n\n\nThe word “yeast,” however, is as old as the language, and first meant the froth or sediment of a fermenting liquid that could be used to leaven bread.\n\n\nLeavening comes from an Indo-European root meaning “light, having little weight.” Related words from the same root include levity, lever, relieve, and lung.\n\n\nYeast comes from a root word that meant “to seethe, boil, bubble over.”\n\n\nThe word knead comes from an Indo-European root meaning “to compress into a ball”; related words are gnocchi, quenelle, knoll, and knuckle.\n\n\nCool temperatures slow the activity of microbes substantially; yeasts take 10 times longer to raise bread in the refrigerator than at warm room temperature. Refrigeration of dough is therefore called retarding, and the cold chamber a retarder. Retarding is now a common practice.\n\n\nThough stale now suggests a food that is past its prime, old and dried out, it hasn’t always had these negative connotations. It is a medieval Teutonic word, and originally meant “to stand” or “to age.”\n\n\nStoring Bread: Avoid the Refrigerator Staling proceeds most rapidly at temperatures just above freezing, and very slowly below freezing. In one experiment, bread stored in the refrigerator at 46ºF/7ºC staled as much in one day as bread held at 86ºF/30ºC did in six days.\n\n\nSourdough Breads Sourdough breads get their name from the fact that both the dough and bread are acid.\n\n\nPumpernickel comes from Westphalian dialect words for the devil (St. Nick) and for “fart”: this is a high-fiber bread.\n\n\nBagel comes via Yiddish from a German root meaning “ring,” and pretzel directly from a German word of Latin origin meaning “little bracelet,” so both are named for their shape.\n\n\nBrioche is French, its root apparently broyer, meaning to grind or knead.\n\n\nThe term biscuit is an ambiguous one. It comes from the French for “twice-cooked,”\n\n\nThe word doughnut was coined in the United States in the 19th century to name what the Dutch called olykoeks, portions of fried sweetened dough.\n\n\nThe French word crêpe comes from the Latin for “curled, wavy,”\n\n\nThe English word pastry, Italian pasta, and French pâte and pâté all go back to a suggestive group of ancient Greek words having to do with small particles and fine textures:\n\n\nCouscous is an elegantly simple pasta that appears to have been invented by the Berber peoples of northern Algeria and Morocco between the 11th and 13th centuries.\n\n\nGnocchi — the word is Italian and means “lumps” — got their start in the 1300s as ordinary dumplings made from bread crumbs or flour (Roman gnocchi are still made by baking squares of a cooked dough of milk and semolina).\n\n\nThe word sauce comes from an ancient root word meaning “salt,” which is the original concentrated flavoring, pure mineral crystals from the\n\n\nThe Roman term ius was replaced by derivatives of the Latin salsus, meaning “salted”: sauce in France, salsa in Italy and Spain. In French, jus came to mean meat juices; bouillon was a stock produced by simmering meat in water; coulis was a thickened meat preparation that gave flavor and body to sauces, to potages — substantial soups — and other prepared dishes.\n\n\nThe French soupe was the equivalent of the English sop, a flavorful liquid imbuing a piece or pieces of bread.\n\n\nAnd the English word gravy appears, derived apparently but mysteriously from the French grané. The latter, whose name derives from the Latin granatus, “made with grains, grainy,”\n\n\nBasic Sauce: Brown, or Espagnole, made with brown stock (beef, veal), brown roux, tomatoes Bordelaise (“from Bordeaux”) Red wine, shallots Diable (“devil”) White wine, shallots, cayenne Lyonnaise (“from Lyon”) White wine, onion Madeira Madeira wine Périgueux (village in Perigord region) Madeira wine, truffles\n\n\nSauce: Velouté (“velvety”), made with white stock (veal, poultry, fish), yellow roux Allemande (“German”) Egg yolks, mushrooms White Bordelaise White wine, shallots Ravigote (“invigorated”) White wine, vinegar Suprême Poultry stock, cream, butter\n\n\nSauce: Béchamel (a gourmand), made with milk, white roux Crème Cream Mornay (a family) Cheese, fish or poultry stock Soubise (army commander) Onion puree\n\n\nBasic Sauce: Hollandaise (“from Holland”), made with butter, eggs, lemon juice, or vinegar Mousseline (light cloth) Whipped cream Béarnaise (“from Béarn”) White wine, vinegar, shallots, tarragon\n\n\nFlavor is mainly a combination of two different sensations, taste and smell.\n\n\nAn emulsifier is a substance of some kind that coats the oil droplets and prevents them from coalescing with each other.\n\n\nAs a general rule, then, a thin sauce will have a more intense and immediate flavor than the same sauce with thickeners added. But the thickened sauce will release its flavor more gradually and persistently.\n\n\nThe word stock as it’s applied in the kitchen reflects the professional cook’s approach to sauce making. It derives from an old Germanic root meaning “tree trunk,” and has more than 60 related meanings revolving around the idea of basic materials, sources, and supplies.\n\n\nMuch more specific and ancient is broth, which goes back to 1000 CE and a Germanic root bru meaning “to prepare by boiling” and the material so prepared, both it and the boiling liquid. Bouillon and brew are related terms.\n\n\nSlowly simmered until it’s reduced to a tenth its original volume, stock becomes glace de viande, literally “meat ice” or “meat glass,” which cools to a stiff, clear jelly.\n\n\nIntermediate between stock and glace is demi-glace or “half-glace,” which is stock simmered down to 25–40% of its original volume, often with some tomato puree or paste to add flavor and color, and with some flour or starch to supplement its lower gelatin content (10–15%).\n\n\nBecause fish flavor deteriorates quickly, it’s important that fish stock or fumet be made with very fresh ingredients.\n\n\nA homely version of the meat aspic is boeuf à la mode, a pot roast braised in stock and wine along with a veal foot, then sliced and embedded in the strained jelly made by the cooking liquid. Chauds-froids are meat or fish jellies that include cream.\n\n\nGel and jelly, words for a fragile solid that is largely water, and gelatin, the name of the protein that can gel water into a solid, all come from an Indo-European root meaning “cold” or “to freeze.”\n\n\nIn the code formalized by Auguste Escoffier in 1902, there are three leading mother sauces that are thickened in part with flour: the stock-based brown and white sauces, or espagnole and velouté; and the milk-based béchamel.\n\n\nThe word puree, meaning thoroughly crushed fruits, vegetables, or animal tissue, comes ultimately from the Latin purus, meaning “pure.”\n\n\nThe Italian puree of basil leaves, pesto genovese, also contains olive oil and so is partly an emulsion as well. Pesto takes its name from the same root that gives us pestle, and the basil leaves and garlic were traditionally ground with a pestle and mortar.\n\n\nSuch a dispersion of one liquid in another is called an emulsion. The word comes from the Latin for “to milk out,” and referred originally to the milky fluids that can be pressed from nuts and other plant tissues.\n\n\nBouillabaisse is a Provençal fish soup that takes advantage of gelatin’s thickening and emulsifying properties. It’s made by cooking a variety of whole fish and fish parts, some of them bony and gelatin-producing rather than meaty, in an aromatic broth with some olive oil.\n\n\nThe French beurre noisette and beurre noir, or “hazelnut” and “black” butters, are such browned butters, often made into a temporary emulsion with lemon juice and vinegar respectively.\n\n\nThe French sauce beurre blanc probably evolved from the practice of enriching cooking liquids with butter. It’s made by preparing a flavorful reduction of vinegar and/or wine, then whisking pieces of butter into the reduction.\n\n\nPreparation closely related to beurre blanc is beurre monté, “worked up” or “prepared” butter, which is simply an unflavored beurre blanc made with an initial dose of water rather than vinegar or wine.\n\n\nThe Provençal aïoli and Greek skorthaliá are emulsified with a combination of pounded garlic and cooked potato; garlic and bread are also used, as are fresh cheeses.\n\n\nSalary, from the Roman practice of paying soldiers in salt; worth his salt; salt of the earth),\n\n\nUnrefined French salts are called sel gris, “gray salt”).\n\n\nFleur de sel, literally “flower of salt,” meaning the finest and most delicate, is a special product of the sea-salt beds of west-central France.\n\n\nThe English word sugar comes from the Arabic imitation of the Sanskrit sharkara, meaning gravel or small chunks of material; candy from the Arabic version of the Sanskrit for sugar itself, khandakah.\n\n\nTaffy or toffee, from the Creole for a mixture of sugar and molasses, and nougat, from the vulgar Latin for “nut cake,” entered the language early in the century; fondant, from the French for “melting,” the basic material of fudge and all semisoft or creamy centers, was developed around 1850.\n\n\nCaramelization is the name given to the chemical reactions that occur when any sugar is heated to the point that its molecules begin to break apart.\n\n\nAnd honey should not be fed to children less than a year old. It often carries the seed-like dormant spores of the botulism bacterium (Clostridium botulinum), which are able to germinate in immature digestive systems. Infant botulism can cause difficulty in breathing and paralysis.\n\n\nHoney comes from an Indo-European root meaning “yellow.”\n\n\nOur table sugar is an astonishingly pure 99.85% sucrose.\n\n\nMolasses comes from the late Latin word mellaceus, which meant “like honey.” The English term treacle comes via the French triacle from the Latin theriaca, meaning antidotes against poison.\n\n\nCaramelization is the cooking of a plain sugar syrup until it turns brown and aromatic. It is similar to the browning or Maillard reactions that give color and aroma to roasted meats, baked goods, and other complex foods, but unlike the browning reactions it proceeds in the absence of amino acids and proteins.\n\n\nThe name fondant comes from the French fondre, meaning “to melt,”\n\n\nThe word cocoa comes via the Spanish cacao, which in turn came via the Maya and Aztec from a probable Olmec word kakawa coined 3,000 years ago.\n\n\nChocolate has a more complicated history. The Aztec (Nahuatl) word for cocoa-water was cacahuatl, but the early Spanish coined chocolate\n\n\nBest storage temperature for chocolate is a constant 60–65ºF/15–18ºC, without fluctuations that would encourage the melting and recrystallization of the cocoa butter fats.\n\n\nThe word ganache is French, and before it was applied to a mixture of chocolate and cream, it meant “cushion.”\n\n\nBecause many people, especially women, experience cravings for chocolate that border on the symptoms of addiction, it has been thought that chocolate might contain psychoactive chemicals.\n\n\nYeasts are a group of about 160 species of single-celled microscopic molds. Not all are useful: some cause the spoilage of fruits and vegetables, some cause human disease\n\n\nAlcohol is a drug: it alters the operation of the various tissues into which it diffuses.\n\n\nOur words vine and wine come from the same root word, and that word meant the fermented juice of the vine’s fruit.\n\n\nThe English word grape appears to come from an Indo-European root meaning “curved” or “crooked,” probably referring to the curved blade of the knife used to harvest grape bunches, or to the shape of the bunch stem. Grapple and crumpet are related words.\n\n\nSweet German wines. At about the same time, English importers of white wine from the Champagne region east of Paris discovered that they could make the wine delightfully bubbly by transferring it from barrel to bottles before it had finished fermenting. And a few decades later, the English developed port in the effort to stabilize strong red wines during their sea journey from Portugal.\n\n\nIt’s estimated that cork taints spoil from 1 to 5 percent of the wine bottles stoppered with cork.\n\n\nWhite wines and light-red rosés benefit from about a year of bottle aging, during which time the aroma develops and the amount of free, odorous sulfur dioxide decreases. Many red wines improve greatly after a year or two in the bottle, and some may develop for decades.\n\n\nA bottle of Champagne holds a gas pressure of 3–4 atmospheres, somewhat higher than the pressure in car tires, and contains about six times its volume in carbon dioxide!\n\n\nIn order to appreciate their sparkle, sparkling wines are best served very cold, around 40ºF/5ºC, in tall, narrow glasses that allow their rising bubbles to be admired for several seconds.\n\n\nName port was originally the English term for any Portuguese wine.\n\n\nSherry Sherry is a fortified, oxidized white wine that was developed in the Spanish port city Jerez de la Frontera, whose name was Anglicized to “sherry” around 1600. True sherry gets its distinctive flavor from the solera system of maturing wine, which was developed early in the 19th century.\n\n\nThe solera is a series of casks, each initially containing the fortified new wine of a particular year, but not completely filled, so a significant area of wine surface is in direct contact with the air. The wine therefore develops a characteristic intense, oxidized flavor. As the cask contents evaporate and become more concentrated, each is replenished with wine from the next younger cask.\n\n\nThis lager beer (from the German lagern, “to store,” “to lay down”\n\n\nLager beers are usually best served somewhat warmer than refrigerator temperature, around 50ºF/10 C, while top-fermented ales are served at a cool room temperature, from 50 to 60ºF/10–15ºC.\n\n\nBeers worth savoring are poured into a glass, where some of the carbon dioxide gas can escape and moderate their prickliness, and where their color and head of foam can be appreciated.\n\n\nGerman wheat beers may be called Weizen for “wheat,” Hefe-weizen for “yeast-wheat,” or Weissen for “white,” referring to their cloudy appearance.\n\n\nContributes to the final liquid. Sake is also fermented at significantly lower temperatures than Chinese rice alcohols. Beginning in the 18th century, most sake brewing was reserved for the winter months, and this remains largely the case today. The upper limit for sake brewing is around 64ºF/18ºC,\n\n\nSake made to be savored is usually of the grade ginjo, or “special,” in which pure alcohol is the only allowed additive and at least 40% of the rice grain has been removed.\n\n\nMirin is a sweet Japanese cooking alcohol. It’s made by combining cooked polished rice, koji, and shochu, a distilled spirit made from a low-grade sake.\n\n\nBernewyn and brannten Wein, ancestors of our word brandy that meant “burning” or “burnt” wine, appear in German laws about public drunkenness.\n\n\nThe word distill comes from the Latin destillare, “to drip.”\n\n\nOur word alcohol comes from medieval Arab alchemy, which strongly influenced Western science and gave it several other important terms, including chemistry, alkali, and algebra. To the Arabs, al kohl was the dark powder of the metal antimony,\n\n\n“Brown” spirits, including brandies and whiskies, are so called because they’re aged in wood barrels, from which they derive a characteristic tawny color and complexity of flavor.\n\n\nThe two classic brandies are Cognac and Armagnac, the first named for a town and the second for a region in southwestern France, each not far from Bordeaux.\n\n\nSome popular examples are apple (Calvados), pear (Poire Williams), cherry (Kirsch), plum (Slivovitz, Mirabelle, Quetsch), and raspberry (Framboise); less widely known are apricot (French Abricot), figs (North African and Middle Eastern Boukha), and watermelon (Russian Kislav).\n\n\nAperitif comes from an Indo-European root meaning “to uncover, to open,” and is a drink to be had before a meal in order to open our system to the nourishment to come.\n\n\nDigestif comes from an ancient root meaning “to act, to do,” and names a drink for the end of the meal that will stimulate our system to assimilate the meal’s nourishment.\n\n\nGrappa, Marc These are the Italian and French names for spirits distilled from pomace, the residue of grape skins and pulp, seeds and stems left behind when wine grapes are pressed.\n\n\nThough it doesn’t look or sound related, the word vinegar comes from the same root as both acid and acetic: the Indo-European ak-, meaning “sharp.”\n\n\nThe simplest, oldest, and slowest method was perfected in the Middle Ages in the French city of Orléans, where spoiled barrels of Bordeaux and Burgundy wine on their way to Paris were identified and salvaged as vinegar. In the Orléans process, wood barrels are partly filled with diluted wine, inoculated with a mother from a previous batch, and allowed to ferment. Periodically, some vinegar\n\n\nTrue balsamic vinegar, aceto balsamico, is a vinegar like no other: almost black in color, syrupy, sweet, remarkably complex in flavor, and remarkably expensive, all thanks to decades-long fermentation, aging, and concentration in wood casks. It has been made in the northern Italian state of Emilia-Romagna since medieval times.\n\n\nEven more fortunate and complex are the reactions responsible for the cooked color and flavor of bread crusts, chocolate, coffee beans, dark beers, and roasted meats, all foods that are not primarily sugar. These are known as the Maillard reactions, after Louis Camille Maillard, a French physician, who discovered and described them around 1910.\n\n\nIn grilling, the heat source is below the food; in broiling, above.\n\n\nInduction heating has two notable advantages over burners and radiant elements. Like microwave heating, it’s more efficient, because all the energy goes into the object to be heated, not into the surrounding air. And only the pot and its contents get very hot.\n\n\nIt’s true that adding salt to water raises its boiling point, and so speeds cooking. However, it takes one ounce of salt in a quart of water — around the salinity of the ocean — to raise the boiling point a negligible 1ºF.\n\n\nGood conductors like copper and aluminum quickly give up heat to their surroundings, while ceramics retain it well.\n\n\nThey “season” them by coating them with cooking oil and heating them for several hours. The oil penetrates into the pores and fissures of the metal, sealing it from the attack of air and water. And the combination of heat, metal, and air oxidizes the fatty acid chains and encourages them to bond to each other (“polymerize”) to form a dense, hard, dry layer (just as linseed and other “drying oils” doon wood and on paintings).\n\n\nUmami (Japanese for “delicious”).\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Spark-The-Revolutionary-New-Science-of-Exercise-and-the-Brain":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Spark-The-Revolutionary-New-Science-of-Exercise-and-the-Brain","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Mich/Spark The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain.md","title":"Spark The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain","links":[],"tags":["books","exercise","workouts","brain","motivation"],"content":"Spark The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nSpark is basically about how exercise is good for your brain as well as your body.

It has about twelve hours to do so, or it will die. Once safely attached, however, the sea squirt simply eats its brain. For most of its life, it looks much more like a plant than an animal, and since it’s not moving, it has no use for its brain.

The genes that govern our bodies today evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we were in constant motion, either foraging for food or chasing antelope for hours and days across the plains. Heinrich describes how, even though antelope are among the fastest mammals, our ancestors were able to hunt them down by driving them to exhaustion — keeping on their tails until they had no energy left to escape. Antelope are sprinters, but their metabolism doesn’t allow them to go and go and go. Ours does. And we have a fairly balanced distribution of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers, so even after ranging miles over the landscape we retain the metabolic capacity to sprint in short bursts to make the kill.\nOne of the key differences between moderate and high-intensity exercise is that once you get closer to your maximum, and especially when you get into the anaerobic range, the pituitary gland in your brain unleashes human growth hormone (HGH).

It is a warning that knowledge is not always transferable.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is an okay book, I felt it was a simple and easy read. Sometimes, it became a bit stale. It is common knowledge that a lot of people in academia are very left-leaning, and a whole lotta people fell for the Marxist-Leninist spell of soixante-huitard. It is a warning sign that people can fall for insanely dumb takes.\nA case of note is maybe Einstein and Godel, who had some horrid takes on freedom in the US. But remember Godel, who in spite of being one of the most brilliant logicians ever, where a deeply troubled man, who had fits of depression.

No one can object to that. But if the dove suddenly appears in red plumage, there is reason to be suspicious.”\n\n\nMcCarthy actually did a huge service to the American left: “McCarthy was a great and long-lasting gift to the American left. He allowed apologists for Stalin’s murderous regime to present themselves as innocent victims of Main Street’s prejudices.

Finance capital and the banks, the hard core of the system of imperialism and capitalism, had turned the hatred of men against money and exploitation, and against the Jews … Antisemitism is really a hatred of capitalism”\n\n\nAccording to studies of the political attitudes of American professors at the time, the proportion of the professors’ vote for the far-left candidates (including Cleaver) in the 1968 presidential election was about ten times higher than in the general population\n\n\nOther hand, saying that someone “deserves X” usually means that one is worthy of X by virtue of some action or personal characteristic. Obviously these are two very different things. And there is simply no way one can validly infer that one is not entitled to X from the mere fact that one does not deserve X. For example, if I win a million dollars in a lottery or if I inherit this amount from my rich parents, arguably I do not deserve this money (for I did nothing to really earn it) but this by no means proves that I am not entitled to it (i.e., that I don’t have a moral right to keep it).\n\n\nTo recapitulate: Parfit’s statement (2) says something very radical and very controversial, namely that rich people don’t have a moral right to keep their wealth. But why should we accept (2)? Parfit apparently tries to support it by adding statement (3), that the rich do not deserve their wealth, presumably because their wealth (especially compared to the poverty of those in Africa) is largely due to their pure luck of having been born in environments full of opportunities. The problem with Parfit’s logic is twofold. First, he provides no real evidence (let alone compelling evidence) for the sweeping assertion (3), and second, even if he did, (2) would still not follow. Another question: If Parfit genuinely believed that he had stolen his house, car, money, etc., from others, isn’t it clear that he wouldn’t continue to hold on to all those things? He is obviously not the kind of person who would keep something he himself regarded literally as stolen. Hence the very fact that he has been unable to renounce his possessions indicates that in his heart of hearts he does not truly believe that he stole them. If Parfit did believe this, though, it would have been extremely easy for him to restore justice in his own case. For after having publicly announced that he wouldn’t stop the poor if they came to his place to remove his property, the only thing that remained for him to do in order to facilitate a quick and rightful restitution was to disclose to the world the address of his Oxford residence. Which he has not done. Notice, however, that Parfit is not talking only about Parfit. He is talking about all well-to-do people in the West. Consequently the import of his statement is far-reaching. His view implies that if millions of sub-Saharan Africans came to the United States, Canada, Australia, England, France, Germany, and Italy, not only would they have a moral right to remove property from rich and well-off households in those countries, the local people would have a moral duty to invite these newcomers into their homes and ask them to take away all the stuff that the current “owners” had stolen from the needy. Such a radical approach to economic redistribution is almost unheard of. In terms of ordinary political taxonomy, it is best classified as belonging to the extreme fringe of the extreme left.\n\n\nThe philosopher F. H. Bradley famously defined metaphysics as the finding of bad reasons for what we believe upon instinct.\n\n\n“Have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner?” —WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\n\nWhen John Silber, former president of Boston University, was asked whether people in the position of making politically sensitive changes in higher education are scared of taking measures in this direction, he responded: “Many are. But ask why. They’re not going to be shot at or put in prison. They’re probably not going to be fined. They’re not going to lose their jobs. Why does it take courage when there is no risk?”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Why-Orwell-Matters":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Why-Orwell-Matters","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Mich/Why Orwell Matters.md","title":"Why Orwell Matters","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","philosophy","totalitarianism","orwell","facism","political-science","politics"],"content":"Why Orwell Matters\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nHitchens calmly and effectively demolishes the right, the left, and all others who have taken Orwell’s name in vain. He delves into the absurd scenarios in 1984 and Animal Farm and highlights the same exact scenarios from real-life scenarios.  Imperialism, Fascism, and Communism, the great calamities of the 19th century, are shown through the lens of Orwell, and also how he always lands on the right side of history.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a book about Orwell and the literature of Orwell and his musings and writings. It is a good book where Hitchens highlights not only the good parts but also the bad, but Orwell´s character shines through, and his contemporaries’ opinions and statements falter.\nThe dystopian nature of the scenarios Orwell writes about is analyzed and shown as profoundly insightful of states and human nature and how terribly true some predictions were.\nOrwell is as relevant today as he ever was, with more than every absurd and dystopian element of his fiction being not only matched but overcome by the real world.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIf Lenin had not uttered the maxim ‘the heart on fire and the brain on ice’, it might have suited Orwell, whose passion and generosity were rivalled only by his detachment and reserve.\n\n\nIt was Pritchett, after all, who had cheaply denounced Orwell’s dangerously truthful despatches from Barcelona by writing in 1938 that ‘there are many strong arguments for keeping creative writers out of politics and Mr George Orwell is one of them’.\n\n\nTo describe a state of affairs as ‘Orwellian’ is to imply crushing tyranny and fear and conformism. To describe a piece of writing as ‘Orwellian’ is to recognize that human resistance to these terrors is unquenchable.\n\n\nThe three great subjects of the twentieth century were imperialism, fascism and Stalinism.\n\n\nAn old radical adage states that the will to command is not as corrupting as the will to obey\n\n\nThere seems no doubt that his insight into the colonial mentality informed Orwell’s dislike of the class system at home and also of fascism, which he regarded as an extreme form of class rule (albeit expressed paradoxically through a socialistic ideology).\n\n\nUnlike some ‘pinks’, indeed, Orwell never romanticized the victims of colonialism, and was frequently annoyed by the self-centredness and sectarianism of certain Indian militants.\n\n\nOrwell’s working title for Nineteen Eighty-Four was ‘The Last Man in Europe’; and there are traces of a kind of solipsistic nobility elsewhere in his work, the attitude of the flinty and solitary loner.\n\n\nTotalitarian” describes a certain kind of repressive social control, but, also, any real society, any adequate community, is necessarily a totality. To belong to a community is to be a part of a whole, and, necessarily, to accept, while helping to define, its disciplines.’\n\n\nBut the transcendent or crystallizing moment undoubtedly occurred in Spain, or at any rate in Catalonia. This was where Orwell suffered the premonitory pangs of a man living under a police regime: a police regime ruling in the name of socialism and the people. For a Westerner, at least, this epiphany was a relatively novel thing; it brushed the sleeves of many thoughtful and humane people, who barely allowed it to interrupt their preoccupation with the ‘main enemy’, fascism. But on Orwell it made a permanent impression.\n\n\nCoincidence, said Louis Pasteur, has a tendency to occur only to the mind that is prepared to notice it.\n\n\nHe monitored the rise and fall of the ethnic joke, noticing that its targets fluctuated with political developments and registering the subtle distinction between jests at the expense of Jews and those which were at the expense of Scotsmen.\n\n\nThe claim is partly justified by an incisive review he wrote in June 1938, discussing Eugene Lyons’s journalistic memoir Assignment in Utopia:  To get the full sense of our ignorance as to what is really happening in the U.S.S.R., it is worth trying to translate the most sensational Russian event of the past two years, the Trotskyist trials, into English terms. Make the necessary adjustments, let Left be Right and Right be Left, and you get something like this: Mr. Winston Churchill, now in exile in Portugal, is plotting to overthrow the British Empire and establish Communism in England. By the use of unlimited Russian money he has succeeded in building up a huge Churchillite organisation which includes members of Parliament, factory managers, Roman Catholic bishops and practically the whole of the Primrose League. Almost every day some dastardly act of sabotage is laid bare — sometimes a plot to blow up the House of Lords, sometimes an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Royal racing-stables. Eighty per cent of the Beefeaters at the Tower are discovered to be agents of the Comintern. A high official at the Post Office admits brazenly to having embezzled postal orders to the tune of £5,000,000, and also to having committed lèse majesté by drawing moustaches on postage stamps. Lord Nuffield, after a 7-hour interrogation by Mr. Norman Birkett, confesses that ever since 1920 he has been fomenting strikes in his own factories. Casual half-inch paras in every issue of the newspapers announce that fifty more Churchillite sheep-stealers have been shot in Westmoreland or that the proprietress of a village shop in the Cotswolds has been transported to Australia for sucking the bullseyes and putting them back in the bottle. And meanwhile the Churchillites (or Churchillite-Harmsworthites as they are called after Lord Rothermere’s execution) never cease from proclaiming that it is they who are the real defenders of Capitalism and that Chamberlain and the rest of his gang are no more than a set of Bolsheviks in disguise.\n\n\n‘Suppression is a much nicer term than murder or torture or rigged trial.\n\n\n‘Power politics’ is a neutral way of saying realpolitik; it gives an impression of stern but regrettable necessity.\n\n\nOn every public building, a huge picture of ‘The Great Leader’ Kim II Sung, the dead man who still holds the office of President in what one might therefore term a necrocracy or mausolocracy.\n\n\nIt’s the only time in my writing life when I have become tired of the term ‘Orwellian’. In some respects, the North Korean nightmare falls short of his dystopia: the regime is too poor and too inefficient to provide telescreens or even wireless sets to most of its subjects.\n\n\nIn the negative part of Professor Hayek’s thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often — at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough — that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamed of.\n\n\nWhen Nixon and Kissinger went to China, which they had more than once threatened with nuclear attack, and proclaimed that Washington and Beijing were henceforth allies against the Soviet empire, I had already read the news by virtue of studying the abrupt shifts of allegiance between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia.\n\n\nThe invading German army, which later uncovered the crime, was instead blamed for committing it (and indeed charged with the responsibility by Soviet lawyers at Nuremberg).\n\n\nConspiracy of silence about the fate of some 10,000 Polish officers, murdered in the forests near Katyn by shots in the back of the neck individually administered by agents of the Soviet secret police. It was not thought politic to mention this atrocity even when well-attested reports came to light. The invading German army, which later uncovered the crime, was instead blamed for committing it (and indeed charged with the responsibility by Soviet lawyers at Nuremberg).\n\n\nIt ought to excite some sympathy with what the author wants, as well as sympathy with his objections to something: and the positive point of view, which I take to be generally Trotskyite, is not convincing … And after all, your pigs are far more intelligent than the other animals, and therefore the best qualified to run the farm — in fact, there couldn’t have been an Animal Farm at all without them: so that what was needed (someone might argue) was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs.\n\n\nFor several occasions I translated different parts of ‘Animal Farm’ ex abrupto. Soviet refugees were my listeners. The effect was striking. They approved of almost all of your interpretations. They were profoundly affected by such scenes as that of animals singing ‘Beasts of England’ on the hill. Here I saw, that in spite of their attention being primarily drawn on detecting ‘concordances’ between the reality they lived in and the tale, they very vividly reacted to the ‘absolute’ values of the book, to the tale ‘types’, to the underlying convictions of the author and so on. Besides, the mood of the book seems to correspond with their own actual state of mind. In a subsequent letter, Szewczenko gave Orwell some information about his potential audience, supposing that he should agree to a Ukrainian edition of the book.\n\n\nHowever, power-worship was at least as strong on the Right as on the Left in the post-war period, and partook of the same kinds of cynical pseudo-realism.\n\n\nAnd how often one was to notice, during the Cold War, a sort of Western penis-envy for the ruthlessness of Soviet methods, coupled with incantations about the relative ‘decadence’, even tendency to suicide, displayed by the effete democracies.\n\n\nOrwell described a certain crude view of modern warfare as being ‘if someone drops a bomb on your mother, go and drop two bombs on his mother’,\n\n\nIt was certainly he who proposed the Lousiana Purchase to Thomas Jefferson, thus helping to double the size of the country (while vainly hoping to exclude slavery from the new dominion).\n\n\nLike many critics of his day, Orwell took fairly easy pot-shots at the violence and crassness of American comics and pulp fiction.\n\n\nUp till about 1930 nearly all ‘cultivated’ people loathed the U.S.A., which was regarded as the vulgariser of England and Europe.\n\n\nYou remember — doublethink is the trick of holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time — and accepting both.\n\n\nAnd he had a strong conviction that the metric system — which was to become such a toxic issue in England in the early years of this millennium — was somehow ill-suited to humans, let alone Englishmen\n\n\nThus pigs — despised by Orwell — are at least to be given high marks for intelligence, while dogs — much admired by Orwell — are exploited, and mutate into enforcers, because of their famous quality of loyalty.\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre — who was regarded with great suspicion by Orwell — once made a telling point about fictional and science-fictional monsters. What we fear, he said, is a creature of great cunning and energy, quite devoid of any moral or mammalian scruple. This, as he went on to say, is an exact description of our very own species in time of war or scarcity. Thus it is perfect, in its way, that the dehumanized torturers of Nineteen Eighty-Four demonstrate their purely human ingenuity by devising the punishment of the rats.\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind here that until recently the Soviet Union had been in a military alliance with Hitler — an alliance loudly defended by Britain’s Communists — and that Moscow Radio had denounced the British naval blockade of Nazi Germany as a barbaric war on civilians.\n\n\nNo less to the point, he had discovered in Spain that the Communist strategy relied very heavily upon the horror and terror of anonymous denunciation, secret informing, and police espionage. At that date, the official hero of all young Communists was Pavlik Morozov, a 14-year old ‘Pioneer’ who had turned in his family to the Soviet police for the offence of hoarding grain.\n\n\nThis was Peter Smolka, alias Smollett, a former Beaverbook newspaper executive and holder of the OBE, who was the very official in the Ministry of Information who had put pressure on Jonathan Cape to drop Animal Farm. It has since been conclusively established that Smolka was indeed an agent of Soviet security; this represents a match of 100 percent between Orwell’s allegation of direct foreign recruitment and the known facts.\n\n\nA phrase much used by Communist intellectuals of the period was ‘the great Soviet experiment’. That latter word should have been enough in itself to put people on their guard. To turn a country into a laboratory is to give ample warning of inhumanity.\n\n\n‘here is a study in pessimism unrelieved, except by the thought that, if a man can conceive “1984”, he can also will to avoid it’.\n\n\nStalin’s propagandists were fond of saying that they completed the first Five Year Plan in four years; this was sometimes rendered for the simple-minded as 2+2=5.\n\n\nOrwell: ‘Autobiography is not to be trusted unless it reveals something disgraceful’; ‘Freedom is slavery’.\n\n\nAdorno lost faith even in that. ‘No poetry after Auschwitz’, as he famously said in a statement that is somehow as profound as it is absurd.\n\n\nMr Auden’s brand of amoralism is only possible if you are the kind of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is pulled.\n\n\nHistory to the defeated  May say Alas! But cannot alter or pardon.\n\n\nAt the last moment, he changed the proofs of Animal Farm so that the story would say: ‘All the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies.’ The original had read ‘All the animals, including Napoleon’, but Orwell had been assured by Russian exiles that Stalin had remained in Moscow during the German assault, and he wished to be fair to him. This is the same Orwell who would not shoot at a Spanish fascist soldier while the man was running from the latrine and trying to hold up his trousers; the same Orwell who sacrificed the enormous extra bounty of a ‘Book of the Month Club’ selection, at a time of extreme financial anxiety, rather than make some minor suggested alterations to his novel.\n\n\nThe majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to taking life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point.\n\n\nBut there is a minority of intellectual pacifists, whose real though unacknowledged motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration for totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other, but if one looks closely at the writings of the younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against Britain and the United States…\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Word-by-Word":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Word-by-Word","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Mich/Word by Word.md","title":"Word by Word","links":["Science/Evolution/The-Triumph-of-Seeds"],"tags":["books","lexicography","language","natural-language","dictionary"],"content":"Word by Word\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIt’s a book about dictionaries.

So it is fun to read about them in a light and fun way as Kory manages to do. I must say that the lexicographers described in the book feel quite the weird bunch. But that is okay.\nThere was a recommendation page somewhere that recommended it along with the book The Triumph of Seeds\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n“nice” used to mean “lewd” and “stew” used to mean “whorehouse.”\n\n\nAt Merriam-Webster, there are only two formal requirements to be a lexicographer: you must have a degree in any field from an accredited four-year college or university, and you must be a native speaker of English.\n\n\nIt is this slog through the fens of English that led Samuel Johnson, the unofficial patron saint of English lexicography, to define “lexicographer” in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language as “a writer of dictionaries, a harmless drudge.”\n\n\nDavid Foster Wallace, modern literary titan, described himself in a famous Harper’s essay as a “snoot,” a “really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire’s column’s prose itself.”\n\n\nThe spectrum of hatred against “irregardless” might be unmatched. Everyone claims to hate the word “moist,” but the dislike is general and jokey: ew, gross, “moist,” bleh. People’s hatred of “irregardless” is specific and vehemently serious: it cannot mean “without regard to” but must mean “with regard to,” so it’s nonsensical and shouldn’t exist; it’s a double negative and therefore not allowable\n\n\nCame of age before the Great Ebonics Controversy, when white people despaired that letting black students speak Ebonics (their native dialect) in the classroom would usher in the end of English and “proper education” as we know it.\n\n\nThe early lexicographers made very deliberate choices to omit sources they felt were not up to snuff. Samuel Johnson got very sniffy about including American sources; Noah Webster thought that some of the giants of British literature were too inflated to include in a sensible language of good English.\n\n\nMuch was made in 2015 of Bryan Henderson, the Wikipedia editor whose personal mission was to delete and revise all appearances of “is comprised of” on the open-source encyclopedia. He has made—by hand—over forty-seven thousand edits to the site, most of them replacing “is comprised of” with “is composed of” or “consists of.”\n\n\nExactly 11 percent of your dictionary is made of words that begin with S. One-tenth of your dictionary is made up of one twenty-sixth of the alphabet. I bet the guy in the picture who supposedly went home and shot himself was in the middle of S when he did.\n\n\nLeave it to Samuel Johnson to break the mold; his 1755 Dictionary is the first to include a definition for the woman-centric sense of “bitch.” It’s a striking entry for a number of reasons, not least of which was that Johnson had made it clear that he wasn’t about to keep track of slang and nonstandard words for his Dictionary. It just so happened that some well-respected Restoration writers (and a handful of nobles, for that matter3) used this sense of “bitch” often enough in their poems and satires that Johnson considered it an established part of English.*\n\n\n“Cant” refers to a type of slang used by various groups on the seedy outskirts of society: thieves, Gypsies, criminals, scoundrels, loose women, and loud drunkards.\n\n\nGrose and his assistant, the aptly and delightfully named Tom Cocking, didn’t just sit over a good dinner and concoct vocabulary: they went on midnight strolls through London, collecting slang words from the docks, the streets, the taverns of ill repute, and the slums, then publishing them in Grose’s work.\n\n\nIt makes words literally relatable: “virulent” is just a dumb SAT word that means “malignant” or “intolerably harsh or strong” until you find out that its root word is the Latin virus, “poison,” the same word that gave us “virus” (no surprises there) and that is akin to the root words for “bison,” “weasel,” and “ooze.”\n\n\nWhy do we call them “sideburns”? It’s a play on the name of the Civil War officer who made them popular, General Burnside.\n\n\nWhy do we say that someone’s “worth their salt”?

These cabins were on the left side of the ship on the way out, and the right side on the way home, and so were stamped “P.O.S.H.” to indicate that the ticket holder had a cabin that was port side out, starboard side home. The “posh” ticket, then, was for the moneyed, elegant folk, and it was this association with wealth that gave us the “elegant” and “fashionable” sense of “posh” we know today. This is a fabulous story: it conjures images of women in bustles swooning on deck, canapés, servants in white linen shuffling deck chairs about for the quality. It’s also one of those great historical tidbits that sink into the language and presents a finely sculpted detail to the modern reader. It’s beautiful—and total bullshit.\n\n\n“RSVP” (répondez s’il vous plaît) and “AWOL” (absent without leave) are the only two that could be considered general vocabulary,\n\n\nLook at “sandwich.” The name was taken from the title of John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich and quite the gambler. He loved gambling so much that he once sat at the gaming tables for a twenty-four-hour stretch, so absorbed that he didn’t stop to take a proper meal but ate cold beef between toast while playing.

Their natural desire is to be a class apart, and if they cannot have titles at home, they wish to be received as equals by titled people abroad. That is exactly our present position, and would be the end of the American dream. All past republics have been overthrown by rich men, or nobles, and we have plenty of Sons of the Revolution ready for the job, and plenty of successful soldiers deriding the Constitution, unrebuked by the Executive or by public opinion.

I wanted to read it to get a better understanding of how git works and to explain how it works more properly to others. In my line of work, understanding the why has been more important than doing the what or improving the how. This is an attempt by me to do this.\nHere is the link to the book as a free open-source book.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data.\n\n\nGit thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.\n\n\nEverything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.\n\n\nGit comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates\n\n\n*The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:\n\nBlank lines or lines starting with # are ignored. Standard glob patterns work.\nYou can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.\nYou can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).\n\n\n\nGitk is basically a visual git log tool, and it accepts nearly all the filtering options that git log does.\n\n\nOne of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to try that commit again, you can run commit with the —amend option\n\n\nAll three of these commands end up with a single commit - the second commit replaces the results of the first.\n\n\nIf you’re using Windows with Git Bash, which is the default when installing Git on Windows with msysGit, auto-completion should be preconfigured.\n\n\nBranching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.\n\n\nSome people refer to the branching model in Git as its “killer feature,” and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.\n\n\nUnlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and merges often, even multiple times in a day.\n\n\nYou’ll notice the phrase “Fast forward” in that merge. Because the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you’re on, Git moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together - this is called a “fast forward”.\n\n\nIf you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging together, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly.\n\n\nIf you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run git mergetool, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:\n\n\nBecause Git uses a simple three-way merge, merging from one branch into another multiple times over a long period is generally easy to do. This means you can have several branches that are always open and that you use for different stages of your development cycle; you can merge regularly from some of them into others.\n\n\nMany Git developers have a workflow that embraces this approach, such as having only code that is entirely stable in their master branch - possibly only code that has been or will be released.\n\n\nThey have another parallel branch named develop or next that they work from or use to test stability - it isn’t necessarily always stable, but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into master.\n\n\nReality, we’re talking about pointers moving up the line of commits you’re making. The stable branches are farther down the line in your commit history, and the bleeding-edge branches are farther up the history\n\n\nIt’s generally easier to think about them as work silos, where sets of commits graduate to a more stable silo when they’re fully tested\n\n\nTopic branches, however, are useful in projects of any size. A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work. This is something you’ve likely never done with a VCS before because it’s generally too expensive to create and merge branches. But in Git it’s common to create, work on, merge, and delete branches several times a day.\n\n\nRemote branches are references to the state of branches on your remote repositories. They’re local branches that you can’t move; they’re moved automatically whenever you do any network communication. Remote branches act as bookmarks to remind you where the branches on your remote repositories were the last time you connected to them.\n\n\nChecking out a local branch from a remote branch automatically creates what is called a tracking branch. Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch.\n\n\nAlso, running git pull while on one of these branches fetches all the remote references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote branch.\n\n\n*It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit).\n\n\nThe easiest way to integrate the branches, as we’ve already covered, is the merge command. It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit),\n\n\nHowever, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in C3 and reapply it on top of C4. In Git, this is called rebasing. With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one.\n\n\nAhh, but the bliss of rebasing isn’t without its drawbacks, which can be summed up in a single line: Do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.\n\n\nWhen you rebase stuff, you’re abandoning existing commits and creating new ones that are similar but different. If you push commits somewhere and others pull them down and base work on them, and then you rewrite those commits with git rebase and push them up again, your collaborators will have to re-merge their work and things will get messy when you try to pull their work back into yours.\n\n\nGit can use four major network protocols to transfer data: Local, Secure Shell (SSH), Git, and HTTP.\n\n\nProbably the most common transport protocol for Git is SSH. This is because SSH access to servers is already set up in most places - and if it isn’t, it’s easy to do. SSH is also the only network-based protocol that you can easily read from and write to.\n\n\nThe Git protocol is the fastest transfer protocol available. If you’re serving a lot of traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn’t require user authentication for read access, it’s likely that you’ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project.\n\n\nRegular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of master. The master branch is that of the dictator. Lieutenants merge the developers’ topic branches into their master branch. The dictator merges the lieutenants’ master branches into the dictator’s master branch. The dictator pushes their master to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.\n\n\nThe —squash option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one non-merge commit on top of the branch you’re on.\n\n\nThe —no-commit option tells Git not to automatically record a commit. This allows you to introduce all the changes from another branch and then make more changes before recording the new commit.\n\n\nThis way, you can export a snapshot or build and name it something understandable to people. In fact, if you build Git from source code cloned from the Git repository, git —version gives you something that looks like this.\n\n\nHere’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1 collision. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel history (1 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it would take 5 years until that repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision\n\n\nStashing takes the dirty state of your working directory - that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes - and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.\n\n\nYou only want to modify your last commit message, it’s very simple: $ git commit —amend\n\n\nSo, if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with git blame to see when each line of the method was last edited and by whom. This\n\n\nIf you pass -C to git blame, Git analyzes the file you’re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere.\n\n\nWhen you’re finished, you should run git bisect reset to reset your HEAD to where you were before you started, or you’ll end up in a weird state:\n\n\nThis is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in minutes. In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate git bisect.\n\n\nGit addresses this issue using submodules. Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.\n\n\nFirst you notice the .gitmodules file. This is a configuration file that stores the mapping between the project’s URL and the local subdirectory you’ve pulled it into:\n\n\nAlthough rack is a subdirectory in your working directory, Git sees it as a submodule and doesn’t track its contents when you’re not in that directory. Instead, Git records it as a particular commit from that repository. When you make changes and commit in that subdirectory, the superproject notices that the HEAD there has changed and records the exact commit you’re currently working off of; that way, when others clone this project, they can re-create the environment exactly.\n\n\nThis is an important point with submodules: you record them as the exact commit they’re at. You can’t record a submodule at master or some other symbolic reference.\n\n\nThe rack directory is there, but empty. You must run two commands: git submodule init to initialize your local configuration file, and git submodule update to fetch all the data from that project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject:\n\n\nThe next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the —global option.\n\n\nFirst place Git looks for these values is in an /etc/gitconfig file, which contains values for every user on the system and all of their repositories. If you pass the option —system to git config, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\n\n\nThe next place Git looks is the ~/.gitconfig file, which is specific to each user. You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the —global option.\n\n\nFinally, Git looks for configuration values in the config file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you’re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository. Each level overwrites values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in /etc/gitconfig, for instance.\n\n\nSome of these settings can also be specified for a path, so that Git applies those settings only for a subdirectory or subset of files. These path-specific settings are called Git attributes and are set either in a .gitattributes file in one of your directories (normally the root of your project) or in the .git/info/attributes file if you don’t want the attributes file committed with your project\n\n\nUsing attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or directories in your project, tell Git how to diff non-text files, or have Git filter content before you check it into or out of Git.\n\n\nThe hooks are all stored in the hooks subdirectory of the Git directory. In most projects, that’s .git/hooks.\n\n\nThe pre-commit hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message. It’s used to inspect the snapshot that’s about to be committed, to see if you’ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code.\n\n\nThe prepare-commit-msg hook is run before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is created.\n\n\nThe commit-msg hook takes one parameter, which again is the path to a temporary file that contains the current commit message. If this script exits non-zero, Git aborts the commit process, so you can use it to validate your project state or commit message before allowing a commit to go through.\n\n\nAfter the entire commit process is completed, the post-commit hook runs. It doesn’t take any parameters, but you can easily get the last commit by running git log -1 HEAD. Generally, this script is used for notification or something similar.\n\n\nIn addition to the client-side hooks, you can use a couple of important server-side hooks as a system administrator to enforce nearly any kind of policy for your project. These scripts run before and after pushes to the server.\n\n\nThis leaves four important entries: the HEAD and index files and the objects and refs directories. These are the core parts of Git. The objects directory stores all the content for your database, the refs directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches), the HEAD file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the index file is where Git stores your staging area information.\n\n\nGit is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. You can insert any kind of content into it, and it will give you back a key that you can use to retrieve the content again at any time.\n\n\nAmazing. You’ve just done the low-level operations to build up a Git history without using any of the front ends. This is essentially what Git does when you run the git add and git commit commands - it stores blobs for the files that have changed, updates the index, writes out trees, and writes commit objects that reference the top-level trees and the commits that came immediately before them.\n\n\nThat is all a lightweight tag is - a branch that never moves. An annotated tag is more complex, however. If you create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit.\n\n\nThe HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you’re currently on. By symbolic reference, I mean that unlike a normal reference, it doesn’t generally contain a SHA-1 value but rather a pointer to another reference.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Productivity/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Autohotkey":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Productivity/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Autohotkey","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/Productivity/A Beginners Guide to Autohotkey.md","title":"A Beginners Guide to Autohotkey","links":["Mac/Alfred","Tools/Tools"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","programming","documentation","automation","autohotkey","pc","windows"],"content":"A Beginners Guide to Autohotkey\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an introduction to AutoHotKey.\n🎨 Impressions\nI did a little work on making AutoHotKey commands, which I shared in my dotfiles.

It’s surprisingly hard to see because of a trick that our mind plays on us, but it should pop out with emphasis: “Paris in the the springtime.” When a line break separates two occurrences of the same word, our brain tends to ignore the duplicate.

It is built up of chapters that covers a lot of different\n🎨 Impressions\nI had some good moments, but I still feel like I struggle with the work on concurrency and Python internals.\nOne interesting thing is to not use None as a return value on functions as they are not that great.\nThe dynamic nature of the Python function makes it difficult to make sure the code is error-prone. Tests are basically the only way to be sure.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nBeware that indexing a list by a negative variable is one of the few situations in which you can get surprising results from slicing. For example, the expression somelist[-n:] will work fine when n is greater than one (e.g., somelist[-3:]). However, when n is zero, the expression somelist[-0:] will result in a copy of the original list.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is to avoid using more than two expressions in a list comprehension. This could be two conditions, two loops, or one condition and one loop. As soon as it gets more complicated than that, you should use normal if and for statements and write a helper function\n\n\nUse try/except/else to make it clear which exceptions will be handled by your code and which exceptions will propagate up. When the try block doesn’t raise an exception, the else block will run. The else block helps you minimize the amount of code in the try block and improves readability.\n\n\nUse try/except/else/finally when you want to do it all in one compound statement. For example, say you want to read a description of work to do from a file, process it, and then update the file in place.\n\n\nThe try/finally compound statement lets you run cleanup code regardless of whether exceptions were raised in the try block.\n\n\nThe else block helps you minimize the amount of code in try blocks and visually distinguish the success case from the try/except blocks.\n\n\nAn else block can be used to perform additional actions after a successful try block but before common cleanup in a finally block.\n\n\nFunctions that return None to indicate special meaning are error prone because None and other values (e.g., zero, the empty string) all evaluate to False in conditional expressions.\n\n\nRaise exceptions to indicate special situations instead of returning None. Expect the calling code to handle exceptions properly when they’re documented.\n\n\nThere are two problems with accepting a variable number of positional arguments.  The first issue is that the variable arguments are always turned into a tuple before they are passed to your function. This means that if the caller of your function uses the * operator on a generator, it will be iterated until it’s exhausted. The resulting tuple will include every value from the generator, which could consume a lot of memory and cause your program to crash.\n\n\n*The second issue with args is that you can’t add new positional arguments to your function in the future without migrating every caller. If you try to add a positional argument in the front of the argument list, existing callers will subtly break if they aren’t updated.\n\n\nOptional keyword arguments should always be passed by keyword instead of by position.\n\n\nUsing None for default argument values is especially important when the arguments are mutable. For example, say you want to load a value encoded as JSON data. If decoding the data fails, you want an empty dictionary to be returned by default.\n\n\nDictionaries are so easy to use that there’s a danger of overextending them to write brittle code.\n\n\nPython’s built-in dictionary and tuple types made it easy to keep going, adding layer after layer to the internal bookkeeping. But you should avoid doing this for more than one level of nesting (i.e., avoid dictionaries that contain dictionaries). It makes your code hard to read by other programmers and sets you up for a maintenance nightmare.\n\n\nPython only supports a single constructor per class, the init method. Use @classmethod to define alternative constructors for your classes.  Use class method polymorphism to provide generic ways to build and connect concrete subclasses.\n\n\nDiamond inheritance happens when a subclass inherits from two separate classes that have the same superclass somewhere in the hierarchy. Diamond inheritance causes the common superclass’s init method to run multiple times, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n\nAlways use the super built-in function to initialize parent classes.\n\n\nThe only time to seriously consider using private attributes is when you’re worried about naming conflicts with subclasses. This problem occurs when a child class unwittingly defines an attribute that was already defined by its parent class.\n\n\nUse @property to give existing instance attributes new functionality.\n\n\nThe standard implementation of Python is called CPython. CPython runs a Python program in two steps. First, it parses and compiles the source text into bytecode. Then, it runs the bytecode using a stack-based interpreter. The bytecode interpreter has state that must be maintained and coherent while the Python program executes. Python enforces coherence with a mechanism called the global interpreter lock (GIL).\n\n\nPython can work around all these issues with coroutines. Coroutines let you have many seemingly simultaneous functions in your Python programs. They’re implemented as an extension to generators (see Item 16: “Consider Generators Instead of Returning Lists”). The cost of starting a generator coroutine is a function call. Once active, they each use less than 1 KB of memory until they’re exhausted.\n\n\nCoroutines work by enabling the code consuming a generator to send a value back into the generator function after each yield expression. The generator function receives the value passed to the send function as the result of the corresponding yield expression.\n\n\nDecorators are Python syntax for allowing one function to modify another function at runtime.\n\n\nUsing decorators can cause strange behaviors in tools that do introspection, such as debuggers.\n\n\nThe with statement allows you to reuse logic from try/finally blocks and reduce visual noise.\n\n\nThe Decimal class is ideal for situations that require high precision and exact rounding behavior, such as computations of monetary values.\n\n\nDocumentation in Python is extremely important because of the dynamic nature of the language. Python provides built-in support for attaching documentation to blocks of code. Unlike many other languages, the documentation from a program’s source code is directly accessible as the program runs.\n\n\nIf your function doesn’t return anything, it’s better to leave out any mention of the return value instead of saying “returns None.”\n\n\nIf you don’t expect your function to raise an exception during normal operation, don’t mention that fact.\n\n\nIf your function is a generator, then your docstring should describe what the generator yields when it’s iterated.\n\n\nWrite documentation for every module, class, and function using docstrings. Keep them up to date as your code changes.\n\n\nCircular dependencies happen when two modules must call into each other at import time. They can cause your program to crash at startup.\n\n\nDynamic imports are the simplest solution for breaking a circular dependency between modules while minimizing refactoring and complexity.\n\n\nPython doesn’t have static type checking. There’s nothing in the compiler that will ensure that your program will work when you run it. With Python you don’t know whether the functions your program calls will be defined at runtime, even when their existence is evident in the source code. This dynamic behavior is a blessing and a curse.\n\n\nThe only way to have confidence in a Python program is to write tests.\n\n\nIt can be difficult to understand how Python programs use and leak memory.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Expert-Python-Programming":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Expert-Python-Programming","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/Python/Expert Python Programming.md","title":"Expert Python Programming","links":[],"tags":["books","programming","python","non-fiction","development","data-science"],"content":"Expert Python Programming\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA book about advanced Python concepts.

Such dependencies of dependencies are called transitive dependencies.\n\n\nThere are two main ways that system-level isolation techniques can be used for development purposes: Machine virtualization, which emulates the whole computer system Operating system-level virtualization, known also as containerization, which isolates complete user spaces within a single operating system\n\n\nFROM image-name: This describes the base image that your image will be based on.\n\n\nCOPY src. This copies files from the local build context (usually project files) and adds them to the container’s filesystem.\n\n\nADD src: This works similarly to COPY but automatically unpacks archives and allows src to be URLs.\n\n\nRUN: This runs a specified command on top of previous layers. After execution, it commits changes that this command made to the filesystem as a new image layer. ENTRYPOINT This configures the default command to be run as your container starts. If no entry point is specified anywhere in the image layers, then Docker defaults to /bin/sh -c, which is the default shell of a given image (usually Bash but can also be another shell).\n\n\nIf a factory is torn down but the rationality that produced it is left standing, then that rationality will produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves… . There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.\n\n\nThe SemVer standard assumes that a version specifier consists of, at most, three numerical segments: The MAJOR segment: Changing the MAJOR segment is a sign of a backward-incompatible change. Users updating between two major versions should expect that their code may no longer be working properly. The MINOR segment: Changing the MINOR segment is a sign of new backward-compatible feature upgrades. Users updating between two minor versions (within the same major version) should not expect their code to become invalid but may receive new functional enhancements. The PATCH segment: Changing the PATCH segment is a sign of bug fixes. Users updating between two patch versions (within the same major and minor versions) should expect some issues to be fixed but should not expect any other enhancements or new features.\n\n\nStarting from Python 3.6, you can use the _ (underscore) character to separate digits in numeric literals. This facilitates the increased readability of big numbers. Consider the following value assignment: account_balance = 100000000 With so many zeros, it is hard to tell immediately whether we are dealing with millions or billions. You can instead use an underscore to separate thousands, millions, billions, and so on: account_balance = 100_000_000 Now, it is easier to tell immediately that account_balance equals one hundred million without carefully counting the zeros.\n\n\nOne of the best ways to better understand the general concept of functional programming is by familiarizing yourself with the basic terms of functional programming: Side effects: A function is said to have a side effect if it modifies the state outside of its local environment. In other words, a side effect is any observable change outside of the function scope that happens as a result of a function call. An example of such side effects could be the modification of a global variable, the modification of an attribute of an object that is available outside of the function scope, or saving data to some external service. Side effects are the core of the concept of OOP, where class instances are objects that are used to encapsulate the state of an application, and methods are functions bound to those objects that are supposed to manipulate the state of these objects. Procedural programming also heavily relies on side effects. Referential transparency: When a function or expression is referentially transparent, it can be replaced with the value that corresponds to its output without changing the behavior of the program. So, a lack of side effects is a requirement for referential transparency, but not every function that lacks side effects is a referentially transparent function. For instance, Python’s built-in pow(x, y) function is referentially transparent, because it lacks side effects, and for every x and y argument, it can be replaced with the value of xy. On the other hand, the datetime.now() constructor method of the datetime type does not seem to have any observable side effects but will return a different value every time it is called. So, it is referentially opaque. Pure functions: A pure function is a function that does not have any side effects and that always returns the same value for the same set of input arguments. In other words, it is a function that is referentially transparent. Every mathematical function is, by definition, a pure function. Analogously, a function that leaves a trace of its execution for the outside world (for instance, by modifying received objects) is not a pure function. First-class functions: Language is said to contain first-class functions if functions in this language can be treated as any other value or entity. First-class functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as function return values, and assigned to variables. In other words, a language that has first-class functions is a language that treats functions as first-class citizens. Functions in Python are first-class functions.\n\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass(frozen=True) class FrozenVector: x: int y: int Such a frozen Vector data class becomes completely immutable, so you won’t be able to modify any of its attributes. You can still add and subtract two Vector instances as in our example; these operations simply create new Vector objects.\n\n\nFunctional programming is a paradigm where the program flow is achieved mainly through the evaluation of (mathematical) functions rather than through a series of steps that change the state of the program. Purely functional programs avoid the changing of state (side effects) and the use of mutable data structures.\n\n\nConcurrency and one of its manifestations, parallel processing, are among the broadest topics in the area of software engineering. Concurrency is such a huge topic that dozens of books could be written and we would still not be able to discuss all of its important aspects and models. The purpose of this chapter is to show you why concurrency may be required in your application, when to use it, and what Python’s most important concurrency models are.\n\n\nWhen using multiple threads, it is very easy to exhaust any rate limit or simply—if the service does not throttle incoming requests—saturate the service to the level that it will not be able to respond to anyone. If done on purpose, this is known as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.\n\n\nTwo events are concurrent if neither can causally affect the other.\n\n\nFor instance, the PostgreSQL database distinguishes three types of row-level events that can occur in either a table or a view: INSERT: Emitted when a new row is inserted UPDATE: Emitted when an existing row is updated DELETE: Emitted when an existing row is deleted\n\n\nAnd Python (together with default CPython implementation) has a few characteristics that aren’t necessarily good for performance: Threading usability is greatly reduced for CPU-bound tasks due to the existence of Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython and is dependent on the Python implementation of choice Python is not a compiled language (in the way C and Go are) so it lacks many compile-time optimizations Python does not provide static typing and the possible optimizations that come with it\n\n\nfiles.

It is about a lot of the core functionalities of Python and how they work. A lot of internal things, such as iterators, data objects and methods and functions, are discussed and analysed in detail.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is nice to learn in detail some of the more advanced features of Python internals and how they work.\nI did find it somewhat difficult to read it as it was sometimes a bit too technical and not relatable to me.  But learning more in detail about Python data models and data structures was super intersting. Would hopefully have a lot of use for this later.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nOne of the best qualities of Python is its consistency. After working with Python for a while, you are able to start making informed, correct guesses about features that are new to you.\n\n\nAlso from The Zen of Python: “Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.”\n\n\nTo initialize tuples, arrays, and other types of sequences, you could also start from a listcomp, but a genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one using the iterator protocol instead of building a whole list just to feed another constructor.\n\n\nIf you write internationalized software, _ is not a good dummy variable because it is traditionally used as an alias to the gettext.gettext function,\n\n\nThe Pythonic convention of excluding the last item in slices and ranges works well with the zero-based indexing used in Python, C, and many other languages. Some convenient features of the convention are: It’s easy to see the length of a slice or range when only the stop position is given: range(3) and my_list[:3] both produce three items.  It’s easy to compute the length of a slice or range when start and stop are given: just subtract stop - start.  It’s easy to split a sequence in two parts at any index x, without overlapping: simply get my_list[:x] and my_list[x:].\n\n\nThis is no secret, but worth repeating just in case: s[a:b:c] can be used to specify a stride or step c, causing the resulting slice to skip items. The stride can also be negative, returning items in reverse.\n\n\nEvery Pythonista knows that d.get(k, default) is an alternative to d[k] whenever a default value is more convenient than handling KeyError.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.3, a random salt value is added to the hashes of str, bytes, and datetime objects. The salt value is constant within a Python process but varies between interpreter runs. The random salt is a security measure to prevent a DOS attack.\n\n\nThe dict type is an example of simplicity and correctness. It’s highly optimized to do one thing well: retrieve arbitrary keys.\n\n\nThe identity of a character—its code point—is a number from 0 to 1,114,111 (base 10), shown in the Unicode standard as 4 to 6 hexadecimal digits with a “U+” prefix. For example, the code point for the letter A is U+0041, the Euro sign is U+20AC, and the musical symbol G clef is assigned to code point U+1D11E. About 10% of the valid code points have characters assigned to them in Unicode 6.3, the standard used in Python 3.4.\n\n\nConverting from code points to bytes is encoding; converting from bytes to code points is decoding.\n\n\nThe best practice for handling text is the “Unicode sandwich”. This means that bytes should be decoded to str as early as possible on input (e.g., when opening a file for reading). The “meat” of the sandwich is the business logic of your program, where text handling is done exclusively on str objects. You should never be encoding or decoding in the middle of other processing. On output, the str are encoded to bytes as late as possible\n\n\nProgramming language theorists define a “first-class object” as a program entity that can be: Created at runtime  Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure  Passed as an argument to a function  Returned as the result of a function  Integers, strings, and dictionaries are other examples of first-class objects in Python—nothing fancy here.\n\n\nProgramming language theorists define a “first-class object” as a program entity that can be: Created at runtime  Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure  Passed as an argument to a function  Returned as the result of a function\n\n\nA function that takes a function as argument or returns a function as the result is a higher-order function. One example is map.\n\n\nIf you find a piece of code hard to understand because of a lambda, Fredrik Lundh suggests this refactoring procedure: Write a comment explaining what the heck that lambda does.  Study the comment for a while, and think of a name that captures the essence of the comment.  Convert the lambda to a def statement, using that name.  Remove the comment.\n\n\nAn impressive functools function is lru_cache, which does memoization—a form of automatic optimization that works by storing the results of function calls to avoid expensive recalculations.\n\n\nAround the year 2000, I was at a training in the United States when Guido van Rossum dropped by the classroom (he was not the instructor). In the Q&amp;A that followed, somebody asked him which features of Python were borrowed from other languages. His answer: “Everything that is good in Python was stolen from other languages.”\n\n\nA decorator is a callable that takes another function as argument (the decorated function). The decorator may perform some processing with the decorated function, and returns it or replaces it with another function or callable object.\n\n\nMost decorators do change the decorated function.\n\n\nThis is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing.\n\n\nA very practical decorator is functools.lru_cache. It implements memoization: an optimization technique that works by saving the results of previous invocations of an expensive function, avoiding repeat computations on previously used arguments. The letters LRU stand for Least Recently Used, meaning that the growth of the cache is limited by discarding the entries that have not been read for a while.\n\n\nAlex refers to an object that is a replica of the object assigned to charles. The objects compare equal, because of the eq implementation in the dict class. But they are distinct objects. This is the Pythonic way of writing the negative identity comparison: a is not b.\n\n\nThe ==  operator compares the values of objects (the data they hold), while is compares their identities.\n\n\nBy far, the most common case is checking whether a variable is bound to None. This is the recommended way to do it: x is None And the proper way to write its negation is: x is not None\n\n\nThe is operator is faster than == , because it cannot be overloaded, so Python does not have to find and invoke special methods to evaluate it, and computing is as simple as comparing two integer IDs.\n\n\nHowever, using the constructor or [:] produces a shallow copy (i.e., the outermost container is duplicated, but the copy is filled with references to the same items held by the original container). This saves memory and causes no problems if all the items are immutable. But if there are mutable items, this may lead to unpleasant surprises.\n\n\nNever, ever use two leading underscores. This is annoyingly private. — Ian Bicking Creator of pip, virtualenv, Paste and many other projects\n\n\nThe evolution of the example will be paused to discuss two conceptual topics: How and when to use the @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators.  Private and protected attributes in Python: usage, conventions, and limitations.\n\n\nThe classmethod decorator is clearly useful, but I’ve never seen a compelling use case for staticmethod.\n\n\nTo prevent this, if you name an instance attribute in the form __mood (two leading underscores and zero or at most one trailing underscore), Python stores the name in the instance dict prefixed with a leading underscore and the class name, so in the Dog class, __mood becomes _Dog__mood, and in Beagle it’s _Beagle__mood. This language feature goes by the lovely name of name mangling.\n\n\n*Ward Cunningham, inventor of the wiki and an Extreme Programming pioneer, recommends asking “What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work?” The idea is to focus on the goal.\n\n\nProtocols are not an invention of Python. The Smalltalk team, who also coined the expression “object oriented,” used “protocol” as a synonym for what we now call interfaces.\n\n\nThis is an example of monkey patching: changing a class or module at runtime, without touching the source code. Monkey patching is powerful, but the code that does the actual patching is very tightly coupled with the program to be patched, often handling private and undocumented parts.\n\n\nHowever, even with ABCs, you should beware that excessive use of isinstance checks may be a code smell—a symptom of bad OO design.\n\n\nIteration is fundamental to data processing. And when scanning datasets that don’t fit in memory, we need a way to fetch the items lazily, that is, one at a time and on demand. This\n\n\nThe only syntax distinguishing a plain function from a generator function is the fact that the latter has a yield keyword somewhere in its body. Some argued that a new keyword like gen should be used for generator functions instead of def, but Guido did not agree.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Python-Testing-with-pytest":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Python-Testing-with-pytest","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/Python/Python Testing with pytest.md","title":"Python Testing with pytest","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review"],"content":"Python Testing with Pytest\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book dive into all aspects of python test module Pytest.

Mostly it’s a label used for some test larger than a unit test, but smaller than a system test.\n\n\nUnit test: A test that checks a small bit of code, like a function or a class, in isolation of the rest of the system.\n\n\nFunctional test: A test that checks a single bit of functionality of a system. A test that checks how well we add or delete or update a task item in Tasks is a functional test.\n\n\nSubcutaneous test: A test that doesn’t run against the final end-user interface, but against an interface just below the surface. Since most of the tests in this book test against the API layer—not the CLI—they qualify as subcutaneous tests.\n\n\nSetting up system state (or subsystem or unit state) is an important part of software testing.\n\n\nTest files should be named test_something.py or something_test.py. Test methods and functions should be named test_something. Test classes should be named TestSomething.\n\n\nThe -v/—verbose option reports more information than without it. The most obvious difference is that each test gets its own line, and the name of the test and the outcome are spelled out instead of indicated with just a dot.\n\n\nThe —durations=N option is incredibly helpful when you’re trying to speed up your test suite. It doesn’t change how your tests are run; it reports the slowest N number of tests/setups/teardowns after the tests run.\n\n\nSetup and teardown are also called fixtures and are a chance for you to add code to get data or the software system under test into a precondition state before the test runs, as well as clean up afterwards if necessary.\n\n\nThe conftest.py file is also optional. It is considered by pytest as a “local plugin” and can contain hook functions and fixtures.\n\n\nHook functions are a way to insert code into part of the pytest execution process to alter how pytest works. Fixtures are setup and teardown functions that run before and after test functions, and can be used to represent resources and data used by the tests.\n\n\nTest classes are a way to group tests that make sense to be grouped together.\n\n\nWe can use @pytest.mark.parametrize(argnames, argvalues) to pass lots of data through the same test, like this: ch2/tasks_proj/tests/func/test_add_variety.py ​  @pytest.mark.parametrize(​‘task’​, ​  [Task(​‘sleep’​, done=True), ​  Task(​‘wake’​, ​‘brian’​), ​  Task(​‘breathe’​, ​‘BRIAN’​, True), ​  Task(​‘exercise’​, ​‘BrIaN’​, False)]) ​  ​def​ test_add_2(task): ​  ​&quot;&quot;&quot;Demonstrate parametrize with one parameter.&quot;&quot;&quot;​ ​  task_id = tasks.add(task) ​  t_from_db = tasks.get(task_id) ​  ​assert​ equivalent(t_from_db, task\n\n\nFixtures are functions that are run by pytest before (and sometimes after) the actual test functions.\n\n\nThe @pytest.fixture() decorator is used to tell pytest that a function is a fixture. When you include the fixture name in the parameter list of a test function, pytest knows to run it before running the test. Fixtures can do work, and can also return data to the test function.\n\n\nIt will also look in conftest.py files if it doesn’t find it in this file.\n\n\nThe test test_some_data() has the name of the fixture, some_data, as a parameter. pytest will see this and look for a fixture with this name. Naming is significant in pytest. pytest will look in the module of the test for a fixture of that name. It will also look in conftest.py files if it doesn’t find it in this file.\n\n\nAlthough conftest.py is a Python module, it should not be imported by test files. Don’t import conftest from anywhere. The conftest.py file gets read by pytest, and is considered a local plugin, which will make sense once we start talking about plugins\n\n\nAlthough conftest.py is a Python module, it should not be imported by test files. Don’t import conftest from anywhere. The conftest.py file gets read by pytest, and is considered a local plugin,\n\n\nA fixture function runs before the tests that use it. However, if there is a yield in the function, it stops there, passes control to the tests, and picks up on the next line after the tests are done. Therefore, think of the code above the yield as “setup” and the code after yield as “teardown.”\n\n\nThe code after the yield, the “teardown,” is guaranteed to run regardless of what happens during the tests.\n\n\nWhen I’m developing fixtures, I like to see what’s running and when. Fortunately, pytest provides a command-line flag, —setup-show, that does just that:\n\n\nFixtures are a great place to store data to use for testing. You can return anything.\n\n\nScope=’function’ Run once per test function. The setup portion is run before each test using the fixture. The teardown portion is run after each test using the fixture. This is the default scope used when no scope parameter is specified. scope=’class’ Run once per test class, regardless of how many test methods are in the class. scope=’module’ Run once per module, regardless of how many test functions or methods or other fixtures in the module use it. scope=’session’ Run once per session. All test methods and functions using a fixture of session scope share one setup and teardown call.\n\n\nThe scope is set at the definition of a fixture, and not at the place where it’s called.\n\n\nFar in this chapter, all of the fixtures used by tests were named by the tests (or used usefixtures for that one class example).\n\n\nHowever, you can use autouse=True to get a fixture to run all of the time. This works well for code you want to run at certain times, but tests don’t really depend on any system state or data from the fixture.\n\n\nThe pytest fixture implementation is flexible enough to use fixtures like building blocks to build up test setup and teardown, and to swap in and out different chunks of the system\n\n\nReusing common fixtures is such a good idea that the pytest developers included some commonly needed fixtures with pytest.\n\n\nFunctionality: it allows you to retrieve stdout and stderr from some code, and it disables output capture temporarily.\n\n\nThe capsys builtin fixture provides two bits of functionality: it allows you to retrieve stdout and stderr from some code, and it disables output capture temporarily.\n\n\nThe captured output is displayed for failing tests only after the full test session is complete. The -s option turns off this feature, and output is sent to stdout while the tests are running.\n\n\nA “monkey patch” is a dynamic modification of a class or module during runtime.\n\n\nDuring testing, “monkey patching” is a convenient way to take over part of the runtime environment of the code under test and replace either input dependencies or output dependencies with objects or functions that are more convenient for testing.\n\n\nPytest.ini: This is the primary pytest configuration file that allows you to change default behavior. Since there are quite a few configuration changes you can make, a big chunk of this chapter is about the settings you can make in pytest.ini.\n\n\nConftest.py: This is a local plugin to allow hook functions and fixtures for the directory where the conftest.py file exists and all subdirectories. conftest.py files are covered Chapter 5, ​Plugins​.\n\n\nDid you know that one of the definitions of “recurse” is to swear at your code twice?\n\n\nHaving ’.’ is a good reason to name your virtual environment ’.venv’, because all directories starting with a dot will not be traversed.\n\n\nThe usual test discovery rule for pytest and classes is to consider a class a potential test class if it starts with Test. The class also can’t have an init() function.\n\n\nThe utility of having init.py files in every test subdirectory of a project confused me for a long time. However, the difference between having these and not having these is simple. If you have init.py files in all of your test subdirectories, you can have the same test filename show up in multiple directories. If you don’t, you can’t. That’s it. That’s the effect on you.\n\n\nCoverage.py is the preferred Python coverage tool that measures code coverage.\n\n\nPlugin called pytest-cov that will allow you to call coverage.py from pytest with some extra pytest options\n\n\nThe first line, mocker.patch.object(tasks.cli, ’tasks_db’, new=stub_tasks_db), replaces the tasks_db() context manager with our stub that does nothing.\n\n\nThe second line, mocker.patch.object(tasks.cli.tasks, ’list_tasks’, return_value=[]), replaces any calls to tasks.list_tasks() from within tasks.cli to a default MagicMock object with a return value of an empty list.\n\n\nTox is a command-line tool that allows you to run your complete suite of tests in multiple environments. We’re going to use it to test the Tasks project in multiple versions of Python.\n\n\nPytest-repeat: Run Tests More Than Once To run tests more than once per session, use the pytest-repeat plugin.\n\n\nPytest-xdist: Run Tests in Parallel Usually all tests run sequentially. And that’s just what you want if your tests hit a resource that can only be accessed by one client at a time. However, if your tests do not need access to a shared resource, you could speed up test sessions by running multiple tests in parallel.\n\n\nThere are no normal timeout periods for tests in pytest. However, if you’re working with resources that may occasionally disappear, such as web services, it’s a good idea to put some time restrictions on your tests. The pytest-timeout plugin\n\n\nThe pytest-html plugin is quite useful in conjunction with continuous integration, or in systems with large, long-running test suites. It creates a webpage to view the test results for a pytest session. The HTML report created includes the ability to filter for type of test result: passed, skipped, failed, errors, expected failures, and unexpected passes.\n\n\nPytest-selenium: Test with a Web Browser Selenium is a project that is used to automate control of a web browser. The pytest-selenium plugin is the Python binding for it. With it, you can launch a web browser and use it to open URLs, exercise web applications, and fill out forms.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Python-Tricks":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Python-Tricks","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/Python/Python Tricks.md","title":"Python Tricks","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","python","programming"],"content":"Python Tricks\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is just a lot of neet tricks to use in python.  It contains knowledge about structures in python, wrappers to use, and a lot of lot more. Nice for a developer with some python knowledge.\n🎨 Impressions\nFun and light read without too much work\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nCaveat #1 – Don’t Use Asserts for Data Validation\n\n\nSmart formatting and comma placement can make your list, dict, or set constants easier to maintain. Python’s string literal concatenation feature can work to your benefit, or introduce hard-to-catch bugs.\n\n\nWhen it comes to variable and method names, the single underscore prefix has a meaning by convention only. It’s a hint to the programmer—it means what the Python community agrees it should mean, but it does not affect the behavior of your programs.\n\n\nThe underscore prefix is meant as a hint to tell another programmer that a variable or method starting with a single underscore is intended for internal use.\n\n\nSingle underscores are a Python naming convention that indicates a name is meant for internal use. It is generally not enforced by the Python interpreter and is only meant as a hint to the programmer\n\n\nIn summary, a single trailing underscore (postfix) is used by convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.\n\n\nDouble underscores are often referred to as “dunders” in the Python community. The reason is that double underscores appear quite often in Python code, and to avoid fatiguing their jaw muscles, Pythonistas often shorten “double underscore” to “dunder.”\n\n\nThese dunder methods are often referred to as magic methods—but many people in the Python community, including myself, don’t like that word. It implies that the use of dunder methods is discouraged, which is entirely not the case. They’re a core feature in Python and should be used as needed. There’s nothing “magical” or arcane about them.\n\n\nPer convention, a single stand-alone underscore is sometimes used as a name to indicate that a variable is temporary or insignificant.\n\n\nYou can also use single underscores in unpacking expressions as a “don’t care” variable to ignore particular values.\n\n\nDan’s Python String Formatting Rule of Thumb: If your format strings are user-supplied, use Template Strings to avoid security issues. Otherwise, use Literal String Interpolation if you’re on Python 3.6+, and “New Style” String Formatting if you’re not.\n\n\nFunctions that can accept other functions as arguments are also called higher-order functions. They are a necessity for the functional programming style.\n\n\nFunctions are objects—they can be assigned to variables and passed to and returned from other functions Functions can be defined inside other functions—and a child function can capture the parent function’s local state (lexical closures)\n\n\nThis clearly shows in what order the decorators were applied: from bottom to top.\n\n\nargs collects extra positional arguments as a tuple. ** kwargs collects the extra keyword arguments as a dictionary.\n\n\nPutting a * before an iterable in a function call will unpack it and pass its elements as separate positional arguments to the called function.\n\n\nBesides the * operator for unpacking sequences like tuples, lists, and generators into positional arguments, there’s also the ** operator for unpacking keyword arguments from dictionaries. Imagine our vector was represented as the following dict object:\n\n\nShallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does not recurse and therefore won’t create copies of the child objects themselves. A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. Copying an object this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.\n\n\nFirst of all, namedtuples are immutable containers, just like regular tuples. Once you store data in top-level attribute on a namedtuple, you can’t modify it by updating the attribute. All attributes on a namedtuple object follow the “write once, read many” principle.\n\n\nHowever, if you try to access an instance variable through the class, it’ll fail with an AttributeError. Instance variables are specific to each object instance and are created when the init constructor runs—they don’t even exist on the class itself.\n\n\nClass variables are for data shared by all instances of a class. They belong to a class, not a specific instance and are shared among all instances of a class.\n\n\nInstance variables are for data that is unique to each instance. They belong to individual object instances and are not shared among the other instances of a class. Each instance variable gets a unique backing store specific to the instance.\n\n\nIn summary, dictionaries are one of the most frequently used and most important data structures in computer science.\n\n\nDictionaries are the central data structure in Python. The built-in dict type will be “good enough” most of the time. Specialized implementations, like read-only or ordered dicts, are available in the Python standard library.\n\n\nBoth are useful tools in practice. There’s one caveat to Python’s comprehensions though—as you get more proficient at using them, it becomes easier and easier to write code that’s difficult to read. If you’re not careful, you might have to deal with monstrous list, set, and dict comprehensions soon.\n\n\nGenerators look like regular functions but instead of using the return statement, they use yield to pass data back to the caller.\n\n\nThis is a recurring theme in Python and in other programming languages. As more developers use a design pattern in their programs, there’s a growing incentive for the language creators to provide abstractions and implementation shortcuts for it.\n\n\nBy chaining together multiple iterators you can write highly efficient data processing “pipelines.” The first time I saw this pattern in action in a PyCon presentation by David Beazley, it blew my mind.\n\n\nGenerators can be chained together to form highly efficient and maintainable data processing pipelines. Chained generators process each element going through the chain individually. Generator expressions can be used to write concise pipeline definitions, but this can impact readability.\n\n\nAfter doing some digging in the Python documentation, I learned that Python treats bool as a subclass of int. This is the case in Python 2 and Python\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/T-SQL-Fundamentals":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/T-SQL-Fundamentals","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/T-SQL Fundamentals.md","title":"T-SQL Fundamentals","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","sql","programming","programming/declarative-language"],"content":"T-SQL Fundamentals\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis is a book about transact SQL.  It goes deep into the dialect of SQL and how to apply it.\n🎨 Impressions\nI learned about true and false not being only true and false but also null. Nice to know.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nT-SQL (also known as Transact-SQL), which is the Microsoft SQL Server dialect of the ISO and ANSI standards for SQL.\n\n\nUnlike many programming languages, which use an imperative programming paradigm, SQL uses a declarative one. That is, SQL requires you to specify what you want to get and not how to get it, letting the RDBMS figure out the physical mechanics required to process your request.\n\n\nLoosely speaking, a predicate is a property or an expression that either holds or doesn’t hold—in other words, is either true or false.\n\n\nNormalization is a formal mathematical process to guarantee that each entity will be represented by a single relation. In a normalized database, you avoid anomalies during data modification and keep redundancy to a minimum without sacrificing completeness.\n\n\nThe first normal form says that the tuples (rows) in the relation (table) must be unique and attributes should be atomic.\n\n\nThe second normal form involves two rules. One rule is that the data must meet the first normal form. The other rule addresses the relationship between nonkey and candidate-key attributes. For every candidate key, every nonkey attribute has to be fully functionally dependent on the entire candidate key. In other words, a nonkey attribute cannot be fully functionally dependent on part of a candidate key. To put it more informally, if you need to obtain any nonkey attribute value, you need to provide the values of all attributes of a candidate key from the same tuple.\n\n\nOLTP: online transactional processing  DSA: data-staging area  DW: data warehouse  ETL: extract, transform, and load\n\n\nWhen it serves an entire organization, such an environment is called a data warehouse; when it serves only part of the organization (such as a specific department) or a subject matter area in the organization, it is called a data mart.\n\n\nA data warehouse (DW) is an environment designed for data-retrieval and reporting purposes. When it serves an entire organization, such an environment is called a data warehouse; when it serves only part of the organization (such as a specific department) or a subject matter area in the organization, it is called a data mart.\n\n\nThe simplest data-warehouse design is called a star schema. The star schema includes several dimension tables and a fact table.\n\n\nYou can think of a database as a container of objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and other objects. Each instance of SQL Server can contain multiple databases,\n\n\nThe model database is used as a template for new databases. Every new database you create is initially created as a copy of model.\n\n\nThe msdb database is used mainly by a service called SQL Server Agent to store its data.\n\n\nMicrosoft recommends that when you refer to objects in your code you always use the two-part object names.\n\n\nThe FROM clause is the very first query clause that is logically processed.\n\n\nA CASE expression is a scalar expression that returns a value based on conditional logic. It is based on the SQL standard. Note that CASE is an expression and not a statement; that is, it doesn’t take action such as controlling the flow of your code. Instead, it returns a value. Because CASE is a scalar expression, it is allowed wherever scalar expressions are allowed, such as in the SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses and in CHECK constraints.\n\n\nThe FORMAT function is usually more expensive than alternative T-SQL functions that you use to format values. You should generally refrain from using it unless you are willing to accept the performance penalty.\n\n\nSquare brackets with a character range (such as [A-E]) represent a single character that must be within the specified range.\n\n\nThe CAST, CONVERT, and PARSE functions are used to convert an input value to some target type.\n\n\nTable operators are logically evaluated from left to right. Rearranging the order in which outer joins are processed might result in different output, so you cannot rearrange them at will.\n\n\nSQL supports writing queries within queries, or nesting queries. The outermost query is a query whose result set is returned to the caller and is known as the outer query. The inner query is a query whose result is used by the outer query and is known as a subquery.\n\n\nT-SQL supports a predicate called EXISTS that accepts a subquery as input and returns TRUE if the subquery returns any rows and FALSE otherwise.\n\n\nOne of the benefits of using the EXISTS predicate is that you can intuitively phrase queries that sound like English.\n\n\nRecall that unlike IN, EXISTS uses two-valued predicate logic. EXISTS always returns TRUE or FALSE and never UNKNOWN.\n\n\nWhen no NULLs are involved in the data, IN and EXISTS give you the same meaning in both their positive and negative forms (with NOT). When NULLs are involved, IN and EXISTS give you the same meaning in their positive form but not in their negative form.\n\n\nA table expression is a named query expression that represents a valid relational table.\n\n\nT-SQL supports four types of table expressions: derived tables, common table expressions (CTEs), views, and inline table-valued functions (inline TVFs).\n\n\nTable expressions are not physically materialized anywhere—they are virtual. When you query a table expression, the inner query gets unnested.\n\n\nThe syntax for inline aliasing is expression AS alias. Note that the word AS is optional in the syntax for inline aliasing; however, I find that it helps the readability of the code and recommend using it.\n\n\nSet operators are operators that combine rows from two query result sets (or multisets). Some of the operators remove duplicates from the result, and hence return a set, whereas others don’t, and hence return a multiset. T-SQL supports the following operators: UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.\n\n\nThe UNION (implicit DISTINCT) operator unifies the results of the two queries and eliminates duplicates.\n\n\nThe INTERSECT operator (implied DISTINCT) returns only distinct rows that appear in both input query results.\n\n\nPivoting rotates data from a state of rows to columns, and unpivoting rotates data from columns to rows, similar to pivot tables in Excel.\n\n\nWindow function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation against a subset of the rows from the underlying query. The subset of rows is known as a window and is based on a window descriptor that relates to the current row. The syntax for window functions uses a clause called OVER, in which you provide the window specification.\n\n\nEvery pivoting request involves three logical processing phases, each with associated elements: 1. A grouping phase with an associated grouping or on rows element 2. A spreading phase with an associated spreading or on cols element 3. An aggregation phase with an associated aggregation element and aggregate function\n\n\nUnpivoting is a technique that rotates data from a state of columns to a state of rows. Usually, it involves querying a pivoted state of the data and producing from each source row multiple result rows, each with a different source column value. A common use case is to unpivot data you imported from a spreadsheet into the database for easier manipulation.\n\n\nThe solution is to use the CROSS APPLY operator instead of the CROSS JOIN operator. They are similar, but the former evaluates the left side first and then applies the right side to each left row, making the left side’s elements accessible to the right side.\n\n\nUnpivoting data involves producing two result columns from any number of source columns—one to hold the source column names as strings and another to hold the source column values.\n\n\nT-SQL supports another function, called GROUPING_ID, that can further simplify the process of associating result rows and grouping sets. You provide the function with all elements that participate in any grouping set as inputs—for example, GROUPING_ID(a, b, c, d)—and the function returns an integer bitmap in which each bit represents a different input element—the rightmost element represented by the rightmost bit.\n\n\nSolving a pivoting problem is all about identifying the elements involved: the grouping element, spreading element, aggregation element, and aggregate function. After you identify those, you simply fit them into the “template” query for pivoting—whether it’s the solution with the grouped query or the solution using the PIVOT operator.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Terraform-up-and-Running":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Terraform-up-and-Running","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Programming/Terraform up and Running.md","title":"Terraform up and Running","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","iac","terraform","code-quality","programming/declarative-language"],"content":"Terraform up and Running\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an introduction to Terraform and IaC. It covers how it works and the logic behind it.\n🎨 Impressions\nOne thing is that you need your environment to be represented as code somewhere, and it should be the true and only representation of that state.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe Ops team occasionally makes mistakes, so you end up with snowflake servers, wherein each one has a subtly different configuration from all the others (a problem known as configuration drift).\n\n\nCode that works correctly no matter how many times you run it is called idempotent code. To make the Bash script from the previous section idempotent, you’d need to add many lines of code, including lots of if-statements.\n\n\nOrganizations that use DevOps practices, such as IaC, deploy 200 times more frequently, recover from failures 24 times faster, and have lead times that are 2,555 times lower.\n\n\nThe Go code compiles down into a single binary (or rather, one binary for each of the supported operating systems) called, not surprisingly, terraform.\n\n\nApply Builds or changes infrastructure console Interactive console for Terraform interpolations destroy Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure env Workspace management fmt Rewrites config files to canonical format\n\n\nThe reason this example uses port 8080, rather than the default HTTP port 80, is that listening on any port less than 1024 requires root user privileges.\n\n\nWhen you add a reference from one resource to another, you create an implicit dependency. Terraform parses these dependencies, builds a dependency graph from them, and uses that to automatically determine in which order it should create resources.\n\n\nStoring Terraform state in version control is a bad idea\n\n\nThe second option for handling secrets is to manage them completely outside of Terraform (e.g., in a password manager such as 1Password, LastPass, or OS X Keychain) and to pass the secret into Terraform via an environment variable.\n\n\nThe reason you need to put so much thought into isolation, locking, and state is that infrastructure as code (IAC) has different trade-offs than normal coding. When you’re writing code for a typical app, most bugs are relatively minor and break only a small part of a single app. When you’re writing code that controls your infrastructure, bugs tend to be more severe, given that they can break all of your apps—and all of your data stores\n\n\n*When creating modules, watch out for these gotchas:\n\nFile paths\nInline blocks\n\n\n\nI generally recommend using Git tags as version numbers for modules. Branch names are not stable, as you always get the latest commit on a branch, which may change every time you run the init command, and the sha1 hashes are not very human friendly. Git tags are as stable as a commit (in fact, a tag is just a pointer to a commit), but they allow you to use a friendly, readable name.\n\n\nTerraform is a declarative language.\n\n\nHowever, certain types of tasks are more difficult in a declarative language. For example, because declarative languages typically don’t have for-loops, how do you repeat a piece of logic—\n\n\nOf course, a username like “neo.0” isn’t particularly usable. If you combine count.index with some built-in functions from Terraform, you can customize each “iteration” of the “loop” even more.\n\n\nPutting these together, you get the following: resource “aws_iam_user” “example” { count = length(var.user_names) name = var.user_names[count.index] } Now when you run the plan command, you’ll see that Terraform wants to create three IAM users, each with a unique name:\n\n\nTerraform’s for expression also allows you to loop over a map using the following syntax: for KEY&gt;, VALUE in  MAP&gt; :  OUTPUT] Here, MAP is a map to loop over, KEY and VALUE are the local variable names to assign to each key-value pair in MAP, and OUTPUT is an expression that transforms KEY and VALUE in some way.\n\n\nFor looping over lists {for ITEM in MAP : OUTPUT_KEY ⇒ OUTPUT_VALUE# For looping over maps for KEY, VALUE in MAP: OUTPUT_KEY⇒ OUTPUT_VALUE\n\n\nWhat you want to do instead is a zero-downtime deployment. The way to accomplish that is to create the replacement ASG first and then destroy the original one. As it turns out, the create_before_destroy life cycle setting you first saw in Chapter 2 does exactly this.\n\n\nGeneral problems that affect Terraform as a whole: count and for_each have limitations Zero-downtime deployment has limitations Valid plans can fail Refactoring can be tricky Eventual consistency is consistent…eventually\n\n\nTwo important limitations that you need to be aware of: You cannot reference any resource outputs in count or for_each. You cannot use count or for_each within a module configuration.\n\n\nThe key realization is that terraform plan looks only at resources in its Terraform state file. If you create resources out of band—such as by manually clicking around the AWS console—they will not be in Terraform’s state file, and, therefore, Terraform will not take them into account when you run the plan command. As a result, a valid-looking plan will still fail.\n\n\nAfter you start using Terraform, you should only use Terraform When a part of your infrastructure is managed by Terraform, you should never manually make changes to it. Otherwise, you not only set yourself up for weird Terraform errors, but you also void many of the benefits of using infrastructure as code in the first place, given that the code will no longer be an accurate representation of your infrastructure. If you have existing infrastructure, use the import command If you created infrastructure before you started using Terraform, you can use the terraform import command to add that infrastructure to Terraform’s state file, so that Terraform is aware of and can manage that infrastructure.\n\n\nThe APIs for some cloud providers, such as AWS, are asynchronous and eventually consistent. Asynchronous means that the API might send a response immediately, without waiting for the requested action to complete. Eventually consistent means that it takes time for a change to propagate throughout the entire system, so for some period of time, you might get inconsistent responses\n\n\nIn short, whenever you use an asynchronous and eventually consistent API, you are supposed to wait and retry for a while until that action has completed and propagated.\n\n\nIf you want to deploy a service fully managed by a third party, such as running MySQL using the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), you can expect it to take you one to tow weeks to get that service ready for production.\n\n\nIf you want to run your own stateless distributed app, such as a cluster of Node.js apps that don’t store any data locally (e.g., they store all their data in RDS) running on top of an AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG), that will take roughly twice as long, or about two to four weeks to get ready for production.\n\n\nThe first reason is that DevOps, as an industry, is still in the Stone Ages. I don’t mean that as an insult, but rather, in the sense that the industry is still in its infancy. The terms “cloud computing,” “infrastructure as code,” and “DevOps” only appeared in the mid to late 2000s and tools like Terraform, Docker, Packer, and Kubernetes were all initially released in the mid to late 2010s. All of these tools and techniques are relatively new and all of them are changing rapidly. This means that they are not particularly mature and few people have deep experience with them, so it’s no surprise that projects take longer than expected.\n\n\nThe second reason is that DevOps seems to be particularly susceptible to yak shaving. If you haven’t heard of “yak shaving” before, I assure you, this is a term that you will grow to love (and hate).\n\n\nYak shaving consists of all the tiny, seemingly unrelated tasks you must do before you can do the task you originally wanted to do.\n\n\nThe third reason why DevOps takes so long—the essential complexity of this problem—is that there is a genuinely long checklist of tasks that you must do to prepare infrastructure for production. The problem is that the vast majority of developers don’t know about most of the items on the checklist, so when they estimate a project, they forget about a huge number of critical—and time-consuming—details.\n\n\nThe first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.\n\n\nThis is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.\n\n\nOne of the main ways to make functions composable is to minimize side effects: that is, where possible, avoid reading state from the outside world, and instead have it passed in via input parameters; and avoid writing state to the outside world, and instead return the result of your computations via output parameters. Minimizing side effects is one of the core tenets of functional programming because it makes the code easier to reason about, easier to test, and easier to reuse. The reuse story is particularly compelling, since function composition allows you to gradually build up more complicated functions by combining simpler functions.\n\n\nThe DevOps world is full of fear: fear of downtime; fear of data loss; fear of security breaches. Every time you go to make a change, you’re always wondering, what will this affect? Will it work the same way in every environment? Will this cause another outage? And if there is an outage, how late into the night will you need to stay up to fix it this time?\n\n\nThat brings us to key testing takeaway #3: you cannot do pure unit testing for Terraform code. But don’t despair. You can still build confidence that your Terraform code behaves as expected by writing automated tests that use your code to deploy real infrastructure into a real environment\n\n\nTypically recommend that teams have a completely separate environment (e.g., completely separate AWS account) just for automated testing—separate even from the sandbox environments you use for manual testing. That way, you can safely delete all resources that are more than a few hours old in the testing environment, based on the assumption that no test will run that long.\n\n\nWhenever running a Go test that deploys real infrastructure, it’s safer to set an extra long timeout to avoid the test being killed part way through and leaving all sorts of infrastructure still running.\n\n\nStatic analysis There are several tools that can analyze your Terraform code without running it, including: terraform validate This is a command built into Terraform that you can use to check your Terraform syntax and types (a bit like a compiler). tflint A “lint” tool for Terraform that can scan your Terraform code and catch common errors and potential bugs based on a set of built-in rules. HashiCorp Sentinel A “policy as code” framework that allows you to enforce rules across various HashiCorp tools.\n\n\nProperty testing There are a number of testing tools that focus on validating specific “properties” of your infrastructure,: kitchen-terraform rspec-terraform serverspec inspec goss\n\n\nOne of the most important lessons I’ve learned in my career is that most large software projects fail. Whereas roughly three out of four of small IT projects (less than 1 million) are completed successfully, only one out of ten large projects (greater than 10 million) are completed on time and on budget, and more than one third of large projects are never completed at all.\n\n\nThe Golden Rule of Terraform: The master branch of the live repository should be a 1:1 representation of what’s actually deployed in production.\n\n\nIf I look at a single file and it’s written by 10 different engineers, it should be almost indistinguishable which part was written by which person. To me, that is clean code. The way you do that is through code reviews and publishing your style guide, your patterns, and your language idioms. Once you learn them, everybody is way more productive because you all know how to write code the same way. At that point, it’s more about what you’re writing and not how you write it.

It is basically an endorsement of nose breathing and guides on how to effectively breathe through your nose. The book is a collection of experiences from across the globe about breathing.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked the book, although I must say that a lot of the points in the book where quite dramatic and unsubstantiated by science. It was sometimes a bit enthusiastic and it was no end to the calamities it could cure, just by breathing through the nose.\nIt was interesting to hear about the nose and how it works.\nAfter being in Singapore for 6 months, I feel like it is strange for me to think of how congested my nose used to be. Might be something to think about and get back to next flu season.\nHow I Discovered It\nI got it recommened on Hacker News.\nWho Should Read It?\nIn think all people who snore should read it. And people who have issues with their sleeping. It provieds interesting insights although my bullshit alarm rang quite frequently.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nMuch more concious about my breathing. I am also incliende to tape my moouth when sleeping to see if i have any imporvements in snoring/sleeping patters. Curious on how to measure this.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nBy the law of averages, you will take 670 million breaths in your lifetime.\n\n\nForty percent of today’s population suffers from chronic nasal obstruction, and around half of us are habitual mouthbreathers, with females and children suffering the most.\n\n\nWhen the nasal cavity gets congested, airflow decreases and bacteria flourish. These bacteria replicate and can lead to infections and colds and more congestion. Congestion begets congestion, which gives us no other option but to habitually breathe from the mouth.\n\n\nOxygen, it turned out, produced 16 times more energy than carbon dioxide. Aerobic life forms used this boost to evolve, to leave the sludge-covered rocks behind and grow larger and more complex.\n\n\nThe skulls ranged from 200 to thousands of years old. They were part of the Morton Collection, named after a racist scientist named Samuel Morton, who, starting in the 1830s, collected skeletons in a failed attempt to prove the superiority of the Caucasian race.\n\n\nWe began to look less like apes and more like people. If you could take a Homo erectus, dress him in a Brooks Brothers suit, and put him on a subway, he probably wouldn’t draw a second glance. These ancient ancestors were genetically similar enough to possibly have our children.\n\n\nLast night, in my first run of self-inflicted nasal obstructed sleeping, my snoring increased by 1, percent, to 75 minutes through the night. Olsson’s numbers were even worse. He went from zero to four hours, ten minutes. I’d also suffered a fourfold increase in sleep apnea events. All this, in just 24 hours.\n\n\nWhen we run our cells aerobically with oxygen, we gain some 16 times more energy efficiency over anaerobic. The key for exercise, and for the rest of life, is to stay in that energy-efficient, clean-burning, oxygen-eating aerobic zone for the vast majority of time during exercise and at all times during rest.\n\n\nMy snoring has increased 4, percent from ten days ago. For the first time that I’m aware of, I’m beginning to suffer fromobstructive sleep apnea. At my worst, I’ve averaged 25 “apnea events,” meaning I was choking so severely that my oxygen levels dropped to below 85 percent.\n\n\nWhenever oxygen falls below 90 percent, the blood can’t carry enough of it to support body tissues. If this goes on too long, it can lead to heart failure, depression, memory problems, and early death.\n\n\nThere are several books that describe the horrendous health effects of snoring and sleep apnea. They explain how these afflictions lead to bed-wetting, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and so on.\n\n\nThis happens because the nose is more intimately connected to the genitals than any other organ; when one gets aroused, the other responds. The mere thought of sex for some people causes such severe bouts of nasal erections that they’ll have trouble breathing and will start to sneeze uncontrollably, an inconvenient condition called “honeymoon rhinitis.” As sexual stimulation weakens and erectile tissue becomes flaccid, the nose will, too.\n\n\nCrustaceans use their elaborately designed shells to filter impurities and keep invaders out. So do we.\n\n\nThe lower turbinates at the opening of the nostrils are covered in that pulsing erectile tissue, itself covered in mucous membrane, a nappy sheen of cells that moistens and warms breath to your body temperature while simultaneously filtering out particles and pollutants. All these invaders could cause infection and irritation if they got into the lungs; the mucus is the body’s “first line of defense.”\n\n\nThe popular erectile dysfunction drug sildenafil, known by the commercial name Viagra, works by releasing nitric oxide into the bloodstream, which opens the capillaries in the genitals and elsewhere.\n\n\nThe lungs themselves will lose about 12 percent of capacity from the age of 30 to 50, and will continue declining even faster as we get older, with women faring worse than men. If we make it to 80, we’ll be able to take in 30 percent less air than we did in our 20s. We’re forced to breathe faster and harder. This breathing habit leads to chronic problems like high blood pressure, immune disorders, and anxiety.\n\n\nNormally, the blood coursing through our arteries and veins at any one time does a full circuit once a minute, an average of 2, gallons of blood a day.\n\n\nStough had expected these elite athletes to have exemplary breathing habits. Instead, he found that they suffered from the same “respiratory weakness” as everyone else: they got the same colds and flus and lung infections. Most of them breathed way too often, high in their chests. Sprinters were the worst off. The short and violent breaths they took during runs put too much pressure on delicate tissues and bronchial tubes. As a result, they suffered from asthma and other respiratory ailments. At the finish line, they coughed and sometimes vomited and collapsed, wheezing in pain.\n\n\nSearched through the current treatments for the nearly 4 million Americans now suffering from emphysema. There were bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. There was supplemental oxygen and surgery and something called pulmonary rehabilitation, which included assistance to quit smoking,\n\n\nIn these interviews, he championed the therapeutic effects of nasal breathing and beseeched audiences with the same message of slow breathing.\n\n\nturned out that the most efficient breathing rhythm occurred when both the length of second inhales followed by 5.-second exhales, which works out almost exactly to 5. breaths a minute. This was the same pattern of the rosary.\n\n\nSeventy percent of the U.S. population is considered overweight; one in three are obese. There’s no doubt we are eating more than we did in the past.\n\n\nIn Japan, legend has it that samurai would test a soldier’s readiness by placing a feather beneath his nostrils while he inhaled and exhaled. If the feather moved, the soldier would be dismissed.\n\n\nTraining the body to breathe less actually increases VOmax, which can not only boost athletic stamina but also help us live longer and healthier lives.\n\n\nIt would become known as hypoventilation training. Hypo, which comes from the Greek for “under” (as in hypodermic needle), is the opposite of hyper, meaning “over.” The concept of hypoventilation training was to breathe less.\n\n\nIn the decades since Buteyko first started training patients to breathe less, asthma has become a global epidemic. Nearly million Americans now suffer from it—that’s about 8 percent of the population, and a fourfold increase since 1980. Asthma is the leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days for children. It is considered a controllable but incurable disease.\n\n\nAsthma is an immune system sensitivity that provokes constriction and spasms in the airways. Pollutants, dust, viral infections, cold air, and more can all lead to attacks. But asthma can be brought on by overbreathing, which is why it’s so common during physical exertion, a condition called exercise-induced asthma that affects around 15 percent of the population and up to 40 percent of athletes.\n\n\nBy around 1500, the farming that had begun in Southwest Asia and the Fertile Crescent ten thousand years earlier took over the world. The human population grew to a half billion, 100 times what it had been at the dawn of agriculture.\n\n\nResearchers have suspected that industrialized food was shrinking our mouths and destroying our breathing for as long as we’ve been eating this way.**\n\n\nThe same story played out no matter where he went. Societies that replaced their traditional diet with modern, processed foods suffered up to ten times more cavities, severely crooked teeth, obstructed airways, and overall poorer health.\n\n\nFarther down is the neck. Thicker necks cramp airways. Men with neck circumferences of more than 17 inches, and women with necks larger than 16 inches, have a significantly increased risk of airway obstruction. The more weight you gain, the higher your risk of suffering from snoring and sleep apnea, although body mass index is only one of many factors. Weight lifters frequently deal with sleep apnea and chronic breathing problems; instead of layers of fat, they have muscles crowding the airways. Plenty of rail-thin distance runners and even infants suffer, too.\n\n\nGelb and his colleagues sometimes remove tonsils and adenoids. This can be especially effective for children: 50 percent of kids with ADHD were shown to no longer have symptoms after having their adenoids and tonsils removed.\n\n\nIt just meant holding the lips together, teeth lightly touching, with your tongue on the roof of the mouth. Hold the head up perpendicular to the body and don’t kink the neck. When sitting or standing, the spine should form a J-shape—perfectly straight until it reaches the small of the back, where it naturally curves outward. While maintaining this posture, we should always breathe slowly through the nose into the abdomen.\n\n\nTo some researchers, it’s no coincidence that eight of the top ten most common cancers affect organs cut off from normal blood flow during extended states of stress.\n\n\nEighteen percent of Americans suffer from some form of anxiety or panic, with these numbers rising every year. Perhaps the best step in treating them, and hundreds of millions of others around the world, was by first conditioning the central chemoreceptors and the rest of the brain to become more flexible to carbon dioxide levels. By teaching anxious people the art of holding their breath.\n\n\nUp to 80 percent of office workers (according to one estimate) suffer from something called continuous partial attention. We’ll scan our email, write something down, check Twitter, and do it all over again, never really focusing on any specific task. In this state of perpetual distraction, breathing becomes shallow and erratic. Sometimes we won’t breathe at all for a half minute or longer. The problem is serious enough that the National Institutes of Health has enlisted several researchers, including Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Margaret Chesney, to study its effects over the past decades. Chesney told me that the habit, also known as “email apnea,” can contribute to the same maladies as sleep apnea.\n\n\nThe perfect breath is this: Breathe in for about 5. seconds, then exhale for 5. seconds. That’s 5. breaths a minute for a total of about 5. liters of air. You can practice this perfect breathing for a few minutes, or a few hours. There is no such thing as having too much peak efficiency in your body.\n\n\nNitric oxide is a powerhouse molecule that widens capillaries, increases oxygenation, and relaxes the smooth muscles. Humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passages 15-fold. There is the most effective, and simple, method for increasing this essential gas.\n\n\nWalk or run for a minute or so while breathing normally through the nose. Exhale and pinch the nose closed while keeping the same pace. When you sense a palpable air hunger, release the nose and breathe very gently, at about half of what feels normal for about 10 to 15 seconds. Return to regular breathing for 30 seconds. Repeat for about ten cycles.\n\n\nDecongest the Nose Sit up straight and exhale a soft breath, then pinch both nostrils shut. Try to keep your mind off the breathholding; shake your head up and down or side to side; go for a quick walk, or jump and run. Once you feel a very potent sense of air hunger, take a very slow and controlled breath in through the nose. (If the nose is still congested, breathe softly through the mouth with pursed lips.) Continue this calm, controlled breathing for at least 30 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat all these steps six times.\n\n\nFalim, a Turkish brand, is as tough as shoe leather and each piece lasts for about an hour. I’ve found the Sugarless Mint to be the most palatable. (Other flavors, such as Carbonate, Mint Grass, and sugar-filled varieties, tend to be softer and grosser.) Mastic gum, which comes from the resin of the evergreen shrub Pistacia lentiscus, has been cultivated in the Greek islands for thousands of years.\n\n\nBox Breathing Navy SEALs use this technique to stay calm and focused in tense situations. It’s simple. Inhale to a count of 4; hold 4; exhale 4; hold 4. Repeat.\n\n\n4— Breathing This technique, made famous by Dr. Andrew Weil, places the body into a state of deep relaxation. I use it on long flights to help fall asleep. Take a breath in, then exhale through your mouth with a whoosh sound. Close the mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four. Hold for a count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth, with a whoosh, to the count of eight. Repeat this cycle for at least four breaths.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Psychology/Hooked":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Psychology/Hooked","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Psychology/Hooked.md","title":"Hooked","links":[],"tags":["books","non-fiction","development","psychology","apps","productivity","web-development","habits"],"content":"Hooked\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the psychology of modern web apps and how we get people “hooked” to the apps and websites. It goes into detail about the steps required to get people invested in the product they are using and how to maintain that investment.\n🎨 Impressions\nI was not that impressed, to be honest; felt it was a bit too high-level and not that deep into how the basic first principles work.\nMore interested in the investment part of getting people hooked to your platform, most of the other things are things that I know about from before.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.\n\n\nPerhaps more startling, fully one-third of Americans say they would rather give up sex than lose their cell phones.\n\n\nA 2011 university study suggested people check their phones 34 times per day. However, industry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 150 daily sessions.\n\n\nTrigger is the actuator of behavior — the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.\n\n\nVariable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users; chapter four explains them in further detail.\n\n\n“If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.”\n\n\nThe Hook Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment.\n\n\nWhen a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing routine, it leverages an internal trigger. Unlike external triggers, which use sensory stimuli like a morning alarm clock or giant “Log-In Now” button, you can’t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.\n\n\nLike nail biting, many of our daily decisions are made simply because that was the way we have found resolution in the past.\n\n\nFostering consumer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer lifetime value (CLTV).\n\n\nWarren Buffett once said, “You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.”\n\n\nFacebook’s success was, in part, a result of what I call the more is more principle — more frequent usage drives more viral growth.\n\n\n“Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.”\n\n\nTwo-thirds of alcoholics who complete a rehabilitation program will pick up the bottle, and their old habits, within a year’s time.\n\n\nWhich demonstrated that consumers’ preference for an online retailer increases when they are offered competitive price information.\n\n\nHabits are like pearls. Oysters create natural pearls by accumulating layer upon layer of a nacre called mother-of-pearl, eventually forming the smooth treasure over several years.\n\n\nBut what causes the nacre to begin forming a pearl? The arrival of a tiny irritant, such as a piece of grit or an unwelcome parasite, triggers the oyster’s system to begin blanketing the invader with layers of shimmery coating.\n\n\nMore choices require the user to evaluate multiple options. Too many choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse, abandonment.\n\n\nUnfortunately, some companies utilize viral loops and relationship triggers in unethical ways by deploying so-called “dark patterns.” When designers intentionally trick users into inviting friends or blasting a message to their social networks, they may see some initial growth, but it comes at the expense of the social currency of users, including their goodwill and trust.\n\n\n“We identified several features of Internet usage that correlated with depression,” wrote Sriram Chellappan, one of the study’s authors. “For example, participants with depressive symptoms tended to engage in very high email usage…Other characteristic features of depressive Internet behavior included increased amounts of video watching, gaming, and chatting.”\n\n\nAs Fogg describes it, non-routine is a factor of simplicity, and the more familiar a behavior is, the more likely the user is to do it.\n\n\nIf you want to build a product that is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their shoes and you need to write a story from their side. So, we spend a lot of time writing what’s called user narratives.\n\n\nDorsey believes a clear description of users — their desires, emotions, the context with which they use the product — is paramount to building the right solution. In addition to Dorsey’s user narratives, tools like customer development, usability studies, and empathy maps are examples of methods for learning about potential users.\n\n\nOne solution popularized by the digital pinboard site, Pinterest, is the infinite scroll. In the past, getting from one web page to the next required clicking and waiting. However on sites such as Pinterest, whenever the user nears the bottom of a page, more results automatically load.\n\n\nInstead, influencing behavior by reducing the effort required to perform an action is more effective than increasing someone’s desire to do it. Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.\n\n\nPeople often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. I almost bought the shirts on sale assuming that the one feature differentiating the two brands\n\n\nStephen Anderson, author of Seductive Interaction Design, created a tool called Mental Notes to help designers build better products through heuristics.\n\n\nAbility is influenced by the six factors of time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness. Ability is dependent on users and their context at that moment.\n\n\nTo combat the trolls, the game creators designed a reward system leveraging Bandura’s social learning theory, which they called Honor Points. The system gave players the ability to award points for particularly sportsmanlike conduct worthy of recognition.\n\n\nEarly humans killed animals using a technique known as “persistence hunting,” a practice still common among today’s few remaining pre-agrarian societies. One of these groups, the San people of Southern Africa, hunt for kudu, a large deer-like animal, using a technique similar to the way Lieberman believes humans hunted for the vast majority of our species’ history. The way we evolved to hunt wild game may help explain why we find ourselves compelled to use certain products today. In Africa, the chase begins when a group of San hunters separate a large kudu bull from the herd. The animal’s heavy antlers slows him down, making him less agile than the female kudus. Once the animal is isolated from the pack, a single San hunter begins the hunt, keeping a steady pace as the animal leaps ahead in fear. At first, it appears the man will never catch up to the bounding beast. At times he struggles to keep the animal in sight through the dry brush. But the hunter knows he can use the animal’s weaknesses to his advantage. The powerful kudu is much faster in short sprints, but the kudu’s skin is covered with fur and can not dissipate heat like the runner’s skin can. According to Lieberman, “Quadrupeds can not pant and gallop at the same time. So while the kudu must stop to catch his breath, the hunter begins closing in, not to catch it but to run it to exhaustion. After being tracked for a sweltering eight hours under the African sun, the beast is finally ready to give up, collapsing in surrender with barely a struggle. The meager hundred-pound San hunter outlasts the powerful 500 pound beast with little more than his persistence and the biomechanical gifts evolution has given him.\n\n\nOnline games like FarmVille suffer from what I call “finite variability” — an experience that becomes predictable after use. While Breaking Bad built suspense over time as the audience wondered how the series would end, eventually interest in the show would wane when it finally concluded.\n\n\nFundamentally, variable reward systems must satisfy users’ needs, while leaving them wanting to re-engage. The most habit-forming products and services utilize one or more of the three variable rewards types of tribe, hunt and self. In fact, many habit-forming products offer multiple variable rewards.\n\n\nIn a satirical take on Zynga’s FarmVille franchise, Ian Bogost created Cow Clicker, a Facebook app where users did nothing but incessantly click on virtual cows to hear a satisfying “moo.” Bogost intended to lampoon FarmVille by blatantly implementing the same game mechanics and viral hacks he thought would be laughably obvious to users. But after the app’s usage exploded and some people became frighteningly obsessed with the game, Bogost shut it down, bringing on what he called “The Cowpocalypse.”\n\n\nCapsaicin, the compound that creates the sensation of heat in spicy food.\n\n\nAlso in contrast to the Action Phase, the Investment Phase increases friction. This certainly breaks conventional thinking in the product design community that all user experiences should be as “easy” (and effortless) as possible.\n\n\nTinder quickly captured the attention of millions of people looking for love with a simple interface, generating 3. million matches from 350 million swipes each day.\n\n\n1.

But when oxygen is in short supply, in comes the mind.\n\n\nProfessor Hopman’s study showed that my metabolic rate increased by 300 percent during the period of exposure, and this increased metabolic rate resulted in an increase in the heat production of my body.\n\n\nCold, heat, and emotion are all stress. They’re all biochemical in the end, or at least they translate that way. These methods enable us to deal with that stress and so much more armed with nothing more than the power of our minds. We go into the cold, we breathe, and we overcome stress while remaining in complete control over our happiness, strength, and health. Who doesn’t want that?\n\n\n\n1  Sit down in a safe, comfortable place and clear your mind.\n2  Start connecting to your breath. Let yourself breathe naturally.\n3  Start counting your breaths. Each inhale and exhale is one count. Count your breaths up to seven, and then from seven back to one. If you find yourself suddenly thinking about your daily life and your to-do list, return to counting the breaths. You will eventually find yourself able to just count the breaths, up to seven and back down again. The blood flow will go into the deeper areas of your brain, awakening feeling, not thoughts. Let the feeling become stronger. Follow the feeling and go as deep as you want. As you go along, the counting will fade away, like a song fading out. Follow the feeling and go deep into yourself, deep into peace.*\n\n\n\nWhile seated or lying down, take 30 to 40 full conscious breaths: Breathe fully in to the belly and the chest, then letting go, without force.\n2  On your final exhale, let the air out and hold it out for as long as you can without discomfort. Listen to your body and don’t force it!\n3  When you feel the urge to breathe again, take a deep breath in, hold for 10 to 15 seconds. Then release and relax.\n4  Repeat the steps above two or three more times, paying attention to how you feel and adjusting your breath as needed.\n5  Rest in this elevated state until you are ready to move on with your day. Alternatively, use the energy you just generated for your morning workout or yoga practice. Experiment with what feels right for you.\n\n\nYour post-breathing practice state is the perfect time to program your mindset. Try this:\n1  Before you get up from your breathing practice, bring up a thought in your mind like “Today I’m going to stay in the cold shower for 15 more seconds than yesterday,” or “I feel happy, healthy, and strong.”\n2  Reflect on this thought and notice how your body feels.\n3  If you identify any inner resistance to your intention, just keep breathing steadily until you feel an alignment between your body and mind.\n\n\nAt the end of your warm shower, turn the water to cold.\n2  If you like you can start by first putting your feet and legs, than your arms, then your full torso under the water.\n3  Do NOT do the WHM Basic Breathing Exercise while standing in the shower.\n4  Gradually extend your exposure every day until you can handle two minutes in the cold. 5  If you are shivering when you get out, try the horse stance exercise.  Success!\n\n\n“Sharing happiness is double happiness, and sharing sorrow is half sorrow.”\n\n\nBefore you begin an endurance exercise, such as long distance running or cycling, do three to four rounds of power breathing:\n1  Breathe in deeply and relax to let your breath go sixty times.\n2  On the last breath, inhale fully and then hold the breath for at least fifteen seconds (or as long as feels comfortable), squeeze your entire body toward the head by tensing your pelvic floor and allowing that pressurized feeling to move up your spine to the top of your head.\n3  Relax to let your breath go and start a new round.\n4  Start each new round with your regular WHM breathing rhythm, and then increase the speed and intensity of your breathing as the round proceeds. This increase is what makes this power breathing.\n5  Wait a couple of minutes to ground yourself again and then begin your endurance exercise.\n6  Breathe more than you feel is necessary and stay aware of your breath during the endurance exercise. You’ve got all the energy you need to do anything, to overcome any obstacle or disease in your body, life, path, or destiny.\n\n\nIn babies, brown fat plays a key role in both thermoregulation and thermogenesis, creating heat when little babies become cold because they’re not able to move around as much as we do. Instead of depositing energy like white fat does, brown fat is capable of energy combustion. As we grow older, the amount of brown fat in our bodies decreases sharply.\n\n\nThe sons of former Civil War–era prisoners of war were far more likely to die untimely deaths than the sons of soldiers who were not imprisoned, even though each subset of offspring was born after the conclusion of the war and, therefore, bore no direct impact of the imprisonment.\n\n\nDoctrines and gurus are for those still battling with the ego, while science — the truth of things — has no use for ego.\n\n\nStress is the killer in our Western society — all that thinking, going into overdrive, making deadlines.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Alchemy":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Alchemy","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Alchemy.md","title":"Alchemy","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","chaos","science","habits","advertising","Behavioural-economics"],"content":"Alchemy\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the lack of knowledge and the dangers of trying to be “too” scientific.  It goes into the different aspects of human nature that is difficult to explain.\n🎨 Impressions\nVery very good book. It is a statement against the logical man and the economic man that is basically a stupid brain exercise. It is a good deep dive into human nature and sets good examples as to why human nature and nature, in general, are more complicated and sometimes do not make sense.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nIt was almost an eye-opener for me, where so many things started to make sense because they did not make sense.  So many interesting tidbits that are so thought-provoking. Highly recommend the book.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea. Don’t design for average. It doesn’t pay to be logical if everyone else is being logical. The nature of our attention affects the nature of our experience. A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget. The problem with logic is that it kills off magic. A good guess which stands up to observation is still science. So is a lucky accident. Test counterintuitive things only because no one else will.\n\n\nSolving problems using rationality is like playing golf with only one club. Dare to be trivial. If there were a logical answer, we would have found\n\n\nTo avoid stupid mistakes, learn to be slightly silly.\n\n\nHere’s a simple (if expensive) lifestyle hack. If you would like everything in your kitchen to be dishwasher-proof, simply treat everything in your kitchen as though it was; after a year or so, anything that isn’t dishwasher-proof will have been either destroyed or rendered unusable. Bingo – everything you have left will now be dishwasher-proof!\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning behavioural scientist Richard Thaler said, ‘As a general rule the US Government is run by lawyers who occasionally take advice from economists. Others interested in helping the lawyers out need not apply.’\n\n\nIrrational people are much more powerful than rational people, because their threats are so much more convincing.\n\n\nMy problem with Marxism is that it makes too much sense.\n\n\nImagine that you get into financial trouble and ask a rich friend for a loan of £5,000, who patiently explains that you are a much less needy and deserving case for support than a village in Africa to which he plans to donate the same amount. Your friend is behaving perfectly rationally. Unfortunately he is no longer your friend.\n\n\nNo coincidence that Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, was one of the strangest and most anti-social people who ever lived.\n\n\nI had always innocently assumed that after Edward Jenner discovered a vaccination against smallpox he would have presented his findings before sitting back to enjoy the acclaim. The truth was nothing of the kind; he spent the rest of his life defending his idea against a large number of people who had profited from an earlier practice called variolation, and were reluctant to admit that anything else was better.\n\n\nAs the psychologist Jonathan Haidt has shown, most moralising works in this way. We react instinctively, before hastily casting about for rationalisations\n\n\nPerhaps advertising agencies are largely valuable simply because they create a culture in which it is acceptable to ask daft questions and make foolish suggestions.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, the phrase ‘Often a bridesmaid, never a bride’ has its origins in an advert for Listerine – here was a hygiene product being sold not on medical benefits but on the fear of social and sexual rejection.\n\n\n‘When I ask an economist, the answer always boils down to just bribing people.’\n\n\nHowever, the problem will never go away, because the number of people who think they understand statistics dangerously dwarfs those who actually do, and maths can cause fundamental problems when badly used.\n\n\nPut in mathematical language, an ensemble perspective is not the same as a time-series perspective\n\n\nTalking to Ole Peters, I realised that the problem went wider than that – nearly all pricing models assume that ten people paying for something once is the same as one person paying for something ten times, but this is obviously not the case.\n\n\nIt’s true that ‘what gets measured gets managed’, but the concomitant truth is ‘what gets mismeasured gets mismanaged’.\n\n\nThe more data you have, the easier it is to find support for some spurious, self-serving narrative. The profusion of data in future will not settle arguments: it will make them worse.\n\n\nWine tastes better when poured from a heavier bottle.

Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things.\n\n\n‘No one ever got fired for buying IBM’ was never the company’s official slogan – but when it gained currency among corporate buyers of IT systems, it became what several commentators have called ‘the most valuable marketing mantra in existence’.\n\n\nIn game theory, this prospect of repetition is known as ‘continuation probability’, and the American political scientist Robert Axelrod has poetically referred to it as ‘The Shadow of the Future’.\n\n\n‘Credo quia absurdum est’, said Saint Augustine, supposedly – ‘I believe it because it is ridiculous.’ He was talking about Christianity, but it is equally true of many other facets of life: we attach meaning to things precisely because they deviate from what seems sensible.\n\n\nThe psychophysicist Mark Changizi has a simple evolutionary explanation for why water ‘doesn’t taste of anything’: he thinks that the human taste mechanism has been calibrated not to notice the taste of water, so it is optimally attuned to the taste of anything that might be polluting it.\n\n\nWater ‘tastes of nothing’, so we notice the smallest thing which deviates from this. You can try a similar experiment with young children. Feed them their favourite food, but add a subtle herb or spice. They will find it revolting, because the slight deviation from what they expect alarms them into believing it is somehow unsafe.\n\n\nWell, sometimes they do – false advertising is common in orchids, which often seem to be the scam artists of the plant kingdom.\n\n\nIn advertising, a large budget does not prove a product is good, but it does establish that the advertiser is confident enough in the future popularity of the product to spend some of his resources promoting it.\n\n\nThere is a problem, however: what starts off as a reliable indicator of fitness can turn into an arms race. If you are a fit bullfrog, how long should you keep up your mating call? The only safe answer to this question is ‘for a bit longer than any other bullfrog nearby’. As a result, a quality that starts off being prized as a useful proxy for fitness becomes exaggerated to an absurd degree, a process sometimes known as Fisherian runaway selection.\n\n\nFor decades, the most sympathetic ear I had at The Economist in London was not their marketing correspondent (who seemed to genuinely hate marketing) but their science correspondent, whose background was as an evolutionary biologist.\n\n\nThe main value of a dishwasher, I would argue, is not that it washes dirty dishes, but that it provides you with an out-of-sight place to put them.\n\n\nThe intriguing thing about Uber as an innovation was that no one really asked for it before it existed. Its success lay in a couple of astute psychological hacks: the fact that no money changes hands during a trip is one of the most powerful – it makes using it feel like a service rather than a transaction.\n\n\nThe Netflix documentary Sour Grapes is a fascinating insight into this world. A crooked, though brilliant, Indonesian wine connoisseur called Rudy Kurniawan was able to replicate great burgundies by mixing cheaper wines together, before faking the corks and the labels. He was rumbled only when he attempted to fake wines from vintages that did not exist. I am told that it is possible to detect a forged Kurniawan wine by analysing the labels, but not by tasting the wine.\n\n\nPeople didn’t want low prices – they wanted concrete savings.\n\n\nThe Polish-American academic Alfred Korzybski (1879–1950) is perhaps most famous for his dictum that ‘The map is not the territory.’\n\n\n‘If the wind rustles the grass and you misinterpret it as a lion, no harm done.

The recommended Egyptian treatment was to eat a boiled assortment of bones, wheat, grain, and earth for four days, a diet perhaps no more satisfying than that prescribed for the disease in 1918.\n\n\nAretaeus of Cappadocia, a celebrated Greek physician, coined the term “diabetes” after the Greek word for “sieve” because the symptomatic incessant thirst and urination made the body act as a sieve.\n\n\nIn 1918, despite thousands of years of medical scrutiny, physicians could only watch helplessly as diabetic children like Elizabeth died.\n\n\nThere are two major types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is defined by the body’s failure to produce insulin; type 2 diabetes is defined by the body’s resistance to or insufficient production of insulin. Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile diabetes, because it affects mostly children, teenagers, and young adults.\n\n\nGreat Britain and its empire lost over 1 million soldiers; France, 1.3 million; Russia, 1.7 million; Germany and its allies, 3.5 million.\n\n\nTo replenish its devastating losses, Britain passed five versions of the conscription act, each one broader than the previous one until the last, when they were calling up all men, married or unmarried, of any profession, from the ages of seventeen to fifty-one.\n\n\nOne thing I learned is that I’d rather save lives than win arguments.”\n\n\nWhile Wilson was incapacitated, he was sequestered from even his vice president and cabinet members. Edith Galt Wilson, Wilson’s second wife, spoke for the president during the remainder of his term, thus earning her the title “American’s first woman president.”\n\n\nAt that time, it was widely accepted that the interests of medical research and the pharmaceutical business were utterly and irreconcilably incompatible. Researchers were primarily concerned with contributing to a body of research by writing, presenting, and publishing scientific papers. Pharmaceutical firms were primarily concerned with making money by means of manufacturing and selling products.\n\n\nAs Eli Lilly saw it, he faced two hurdles in creating a creditable new internal research group, and they were two sides of the same coin. The first hurdle was to persuade the company’s board of directors to invest in a fundamental research department. The second hurdle was to persuade a research scientist to climb down from the ivory tower to work in the world of commercial enterprise.\n\n\nIn 400 B.C., Hippocrates used the powdered bark and leaves of the willow tree to help relieve pain and fever. By 1829, scientists had identified willow’s beneficial compound as salicin. Then French chemist Henri Leroux improved the extraction process and Italian chemist Raffaele Piria refined salicin, isolating salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is highly effective but it irritates the stomach. In 1853 another French chemist, Charles Gerhardt, succeeded in buffering salicylic acid without diminishing its efficacy. Like a true academic, Gerhardt published a paper to document his results and thought no more about it. It wasn’t until 1897—forty-four years after Gerhardt’s discovery—that a chemist named Felix Hoffman at Germany’s Friedrich Bayer &amp; Co. began working with the compound in order to alleviate his father’s arthritis pain. By 1899 Bayer aspirin was selling around the world.\n\n\nOn the evening of March 31, Best broke. He visited Banting’s boarding- house room and let loose his fury and frustration as he had never dare to before. He attacked Banting for allowing himself to languish in morbid self-pity when so many around him were working hard toward a solution. Banting drank stolen alcohol from a beaker and listened impassively. “You said we’d do whatever it takes!” Charley howled. Banting shrugged. “Changed my mind.” “It’s too late to change your mind. You sold your house. You sold your car. We stole dogs!” “It takes a brave man to know when to surrender.”\n\n\nBanting raised his glass and drank to bravery while Charley watched in disbelief. “Col- lip’s process worked. Ours didn’t. Here’s to the continued success and glory of James Bertram Collip! I salute you—you prig bastard.” “So he won the purification round. So what. We still have to find a way to make large quantities. Aren’t you the one who’s always reminding everyone that this is about the diabetics?” “To the diabetics!” Banting raised the beaker, drained it, and threw it across the room. It shattered against the wall.\n\n\nIn August 1922, the quality, quantity, and potency of each batch were utterly unpredictable, and deterioration and sensitization reactions continued to present problems for clinical use. Clinical data from all of the participating physicians accrued and was analyzed in Toronto: There was a frustrating mixture of miraculous recoveries and baffling failures.\n\n\n“But the problem is one of shortage, is it not? If so, then if Elizabeth receives insulin it may be at the cost of another child’s life.”\n\n\n“If you are asking me to do this, I will consider it.” He held her gaze for a long time, watching her carefully. “Are you asking?” “I am asking,” she said in a barely audible voice. And then she went to bed.\n\n\n“Excuse us.” Antoinette interrupted the doctor as she guided Elizabeth toward the door. “We’ve a long trip ahead and no time to spare.” Antoinette now stood nose to nose with Allen. “This is my institute!” he snapped. “This is my daughter!” she rejoined. “Do you think that being Mrs. Charles Evans Hughes gives you any authority in my hospital?” “I am her mother! Now please, step aside!”\n\n\nBefore 1922, hyperglycemic coma, induced by total lack of or insufficient insulin, accounted for 86 percent of the mortality of diabetic children; after insulin, from 1922 to 1936 the mortality rate of diabetic children from hyperglycemic coma declined, but was still 56 percent. The first diabetic “resurrected” from a hyperglycemic coma by the injection of insulin was eleven-year-old Elsie Needham, at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto in October 1922.\n\n\nAs Frederick Allen said, insulin improved but did not simplify the treatment of diabetes.\n\n\nCharles now understood something that Elizabeth had learned through her years of trial—that the purpose of living is not to preserve life but to lose it. Living is by necessity a process of continuous loss. As we live we lose time, we lose innocence, we lose family and friends, we lose memories, and the longer we live, the more we lose. Ultimately, we lose the process of losing itself. Accepting this, Charles was free. He was no longer a standard-bearer; he was a man.\n\n\nFrequently less than one dollar per week and seldom more than two dollars. (Consider that this was just two years after the initial announcement in New Haven and one year after Elizabeth left Toronto to begin a new and normal life.\n\n\nThe Banting Research Foundation played a major role in supporting the development of the first anti-gravity or G-suit, designed to prevent pilots from blacking out when subjected to extreme acceleration. These suits were used during World War II, and all G-suits worn by pilots, astronauts, and cosmonauts are based on this original design.\n\n\nIN LATE 1922 Dr. August Krogh returned to Denmark with the insulin formula, courtesy of Macleod. In the spring of 1923, Dr. Krogh and Professor H. C. Hagedorn founded the Nordisk Insulin Laboratorium, which began to manufacture the first Scandinavian insulin. Two years later, Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium was founded and started producing insulin and a special syringe for injecting it.\n\n\nThe initial work that led to this new type of insulin took place in Denmark, where Dr. Hagedorn discovered that protamine, derived from fish sperm, when combined with insulin, slowed its action. The new protamine insulin allowed many diabetics to reduce their daily injections by half.\n\n\nNovo Nordisk—originally Nordisk Insulin Laboratorium—is also a world leader in diabetes care, with international production facilities in seven countries and more than 29,000 employees (as of December 2009).\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/A-Story-of-Us":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/A-Story-of-Us","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Evolution/A Story of Us.md","title":"A Story of Us","links":[],"tags":["books"],"content":"A Story of Us\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIt is about the evolution of us, starting from where we separated from the other apes.

As a result, our digestive system handles food that contains, weight for weight, considerably more calories and nutrients than the food that runs through an ape digestive system.\n\n\nTraces of ancient fires have been found near human remains dating back beyond 1.5 million years, but it’s impossible to conclude from this that humans made the fires.\n\n\nThis sort of evidence has been found, but so far only in archaeological sites of a much more recent date. The oldest sites are about 300,000 to 400,000 years old.\n\n\nThe body of modern humans has adaptations that allow us to be more mobile than other large animals. Even though we aren’t fast runners compared to horses, lions, and chimpanzees, we can walk for miles without tiring, and we can, with training, become better at running long distances than any other mammal.\n\n\nDuring the ice age that occurred around 1.9 million years ago, the sea level was 200 feet lower than it is today. The islands of Java and Sumatra were attached to the mainland at that time, and early humans could have simply walked to them.\n\n\nInside our brain’s large prefrontal cortex, a vast amount of information is integrated and processed in ways that can’t happen in other animals.\n\n\nExperiments have shown that working with others affects children’s behavior. Afterward, they’re more generous in sharing any goodies the experimenters give them—as if working with others has put them in a better mood.\n\n\nOver the course of human evolutionary history, there may have been some independent-minded women who thought things through and decided to avoid the pain and risks of motherhood. These women are not our ancestors.\n\n\nIf marriage was a recent invention, you’d expect to find at least a few cultures with no idea of it. But you don’t. The basic belief that it’s important to know who fathered a child likely began hundreds of thousands of years ago when our ancestors lived in Africa.\n\n\nHuman males have the much smaller testes typical of mammals in which females only mate with a single male each time they ovulate.\n\n\nIt’s normal for women to carry more fat than men, and women’s bodies function well even if fat makes up over a third of their body mass.\n\n\nMany mammals that live in seasonal habitats put on fat during the times when food is most plentiful, but the amount of fat in human bodies, particularly woman’s bodies, is extraordinary. It’s many times greater than that seen in any other land animal.\n\n\nMeasurements have shown that a five-year-old’s brain absorbs energy at nearly double the rate of an adult’s brain.\n\n\nThe period between about 60,000 and 12,000 years ago seems to have been the most highly variable of all the ice ages.\n\n\nBy 40,000 years ago, humans that looked similar to us had spread out of Africa, and by 30,000 years ago the other kinds of humans were probably extinct. No evidence has so far been found of Neanderthal or Denisovan humans surviving beyond about 37,000 years ago.\n\n\nArchaeologists have become expert at recognizing the signs of death by violence. They have dug up and inspected many bodies from sites of battles and massacres.\n\n\nThe genetic similarity of all humans alive today suggests that during at least one point in our history, the population of Homo sapiens was very low, perhaps only a few thousand people. Genetic evidence suggests that everyone alive today is descended from humans who were living in Africa 60,000 years ago,\n\n\nThe archaeological evidence suggests that warfare was rare before about 8,000 years ago.\n\n\nCulture also provides some pretty spectacular curiosities—the pyramids of Egypt for example. Why did people living in the Nile Valley about 4,500 years ago spend so much time building these massive tombs for the pharaoh who ruled them? The answer may be a similar runaway mechanism. Positive feedback loops are also created as cultures evolve, particularly in the evolution of social tools.\n\n\nBy the age of five a child has learned over 2,000 words, but the word sounds that children make aren’t precise copies of the ones made by their parents.\n\n\nOf the more than 7,000 languages spoken today, a few dozen are known as “isolates,” unrelated to any language so far discovered\n\n\nThe Chinese languages are part of “Sino-Tibetan” family, which has more than 450 members. Arabic is one of the 350 plus languages of the “Afro-Asiatic” family. And over half the world speaks at least one of the 430 or so languages belonging to the “Indo-European” family, which includes the languages spoken from Iceland to Sri Lanka, from Vladivostok to Spain.\n\n\nMany archaeologists and historians thought it most likely that PIE was spoken by early cereal farmers who migrated into Europe from the Near East. The historical linguists disagreed. They pointed out that PIE speakers didn’t have the vocabulary of a Near Eastern farmer. They didn’t have words for palm tree, olive, or monkey, which would surely be familiar to people living in the Near East. On the other hand, PIE did have words for birch tree, salmon, and beaver, which people in the Near East would never see.\n\n\nThe “Black Death” plague pandemic, which sickened Eurasia and northern Africa during the middle years of 1300s, probably killed over a 100 million people at a time when the entire human population was only about 500 million. Entire towns and villages were wiped out.\n\n\nIn the premodern European family-based system, it was families that had rights.\n\n\nIn 1979, China began to strongly discourage most of its population from having more than one child. Many Westerners believe this policy caused Chinese fertility to decline, but the evidence clearly shows this isn’t true—the decline was already well underway.\n\n\nSome of the rules members of Haredi communities follow give members a characteristic appearance. For example, married women must not allow their hair to be seen in public, and males aren’t allowed to cut the hair on either side of their face.\n\n\nThe word “patriotism” comes from the Latin word pater, which means “father.”\n\n\nThe fertility of the English-speaking people at a key stage of modernization goes a long way to explaining why English is currently the main language of diplomacy, science, and global business.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/Serengeti-Rules":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/Serengeti-Rules","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Evolution/Serengeti Rules.md","title":"Serengeti Rules","links":["Thinking/Systems"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","biology","cascades","evolution"],"content":"Serengeti Rules\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nOne of my favorite books I read in 2021; it is a nice book with good and interesting points and is kind of tied to systems thinking.

Some species exert effects on the stability of the community that are not proportional to their biomass or numbers.\nSome species mediate strong indirect effects through trophic cascades.\nCompetition: Some species compete for common resources. Species that compete for space, food or habitat can regulate the abundance of other species.\nBody size affects mode of regulation. Smaller animals are regulated by predators and larger animals by food supply.\nDensity: regulation of some species depends upon their density\nMigration increases animal numbers by increasing access to food (reducing bottom-up regulation) and decreasing susceptibility to predation (reducing top-down regulation).\nKeystone species: Not all species are equal.

An insect called brown planthopper devastated the rice fields. 350,000 tons of rice were lost, enough to feed 3 million people over an entire year. When treated with pesticides, the insect population increased 800-fold. This was due to a multitude of factors:\nThe insect had evolved resistance to commonly applied pesticides.\nThe pesticides actually increased the rate of egg-laying by about 2.5 fold\nThe pesticides killed wolf spiders and other natural predators of the brown planthoppers.

Dawkins eloquently dismisses arguments that darwinian evolution is random and that complexity cannot arrive by small steps and explains how it happes.\n🎨 Impressions\nA bit of a hard read, in the sense that I felt it could be a bit dense. Else it was good and Dawkins writes superbly.  Also, Dawkins beatiufully explains DNA and how it works.\nHow I Discovered It\nI wanted to provoke Mohamad so i added a bunch of Dawkins to my reading list. No reason other than that.\nWho Should Read It?\nAll who have a somewhat interested in the book. I think it is a bit of a hard swallow so should be careful not to start on this book when there are easier more accessesible books out there.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI think I got more from the book by understanding how the darwinian evolution works and how it arrives to the end-state we see today, rather than having an epinaphy about evolution.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nI had been warned to expect hostile questioning from fundamentalist listeners and I confess I was looking forward to destroying their arguments.\n\n\nIt is rather implausibly said that Christian Doppler himself demonstrated his effect by hiring a brass band to play on an open railway truck as it rushed past his amazed audience. It is relative motion that matters, and as far as the Doppler Effect is concerned it doesn’t matter whether we consider the sound source to be moving past the ear, or the ear moving past the sound source.\n\n\nMutation is random; natural selection is the very opposite of random. Second, it just isn’t true that ‘each by itself is useless’. It isn’t true that the whole perfect work must have been achieved simultaneously. It isn’t true that each part is essential for the success of the whole. A simple, rudimentary, half-cocked eye/ear/echolocation system/cuckoo parasitism system, etc., is better than none at all. Without an eye you are totally blind.\n\n\nThe theoretical importance of parasites would take too long to explain fully. Briefly, the problem with all ‘eugenic’ theories of female choice has always been as follows. If females really could successfully choose males with the best genes, their very success would reduce the range of choice available in the future: eventually, if there were only good genes around, there would be no point in choosing. Parasites remove this theoretical objection. The reason is that, according to Hamilton, parasites and hosts are running a never-ceasing cyclical arms race against one another. This in turn means that the ‘best’ genes in any one generation of birds are not the same as the best genes in future generations. What it takes to beat the current generation of parasites is no good against the next generation of evolving parasites.\n\n\nThis belief, that Darwinian evolution is ‘random’, is not merely false. It is the exact opposite of the truth. Chance is a minor ingredient in the Darwinian recipe, but the most important ingredient is cumulative selection which is quintessentially nonrandom.\n\n\n‘Dollo’s Law’ states that evolution is irreversible. This is often confused with a lot of idealistic nonsense about the inevitability of progress, often coupled with ignorant nonsense about evolution ‘violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics’ (those that belong to the half of the educated population that, according to the novelist C.P. Snow, know what the Second Law is, will realize that it is no more violated by evolution than it is violated by the growth of a baby).\n\n\nDollo’s Law is really just a statement about the statistical improbability of following exactly the same evolutionary trajectory twice (or, indeed, any particular trajectory), in either direction. A single mutational step can easily be reversed.\n\n\nHow good would each typist have to be, in order to match the DNA’s performance? The answer is almost too ludicrous to express. For what it is worth, every typist would have to have an error rate of about one in a trillion; that is, he would have to be accurate enough to make only a single error in typing the Bible 250,000 times at a stretch. A good secretary in real life has an error rate of about one per page. This is about half a billion times the error rate of the histone H4 gene.\n\n\n‘It is widely accepted that some, perhaps many, of the abiotic chemical reactions and processes leading to the origin on Earth of replicating micro-organisms occurred very early in the history of Earth in close proximity to the surfaces of clay minerals and other inorganic substrates.’\n\n\nOne reason for this is summarized in the Aesopian moral: The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life, while the fox is only running for his dinner.\n\n\nDarwin applied the idea of evolution in a discriminating way to living organisms changing in body form over countless generations. His successors have been tempted to see evolution in everything; in the changing form of the universe, in developmental ‘stages’ of human civilizations, in fashions in skirt lengths. Sometimes such analogies can be immensely fruitful, but it is easy to push analogies too far, and get overexcited by analogies that are so tenuous as to be unhelpful or even downright harmful.\n\n\nin the words of a kind reviewer of my own first book, ‘The reader is warned that he must put on his mental running shoes’.\n\n\nComparisons between modern punctuationism on the one hand, and catastrophism or saltationism on the other, have a purely poetic force. They are, if I may coin a paradox, deeply superficial. They sound impressive in an artsy, literary way, but they do nothing to aid serious understanding, and they can give spurious aid and comfort to modern creationists in their disturbingly successful fight to subvert American education and textbook publishing.\n\n\nT. D. Lysenko was a second-rate agricultural plant breeder of no distinction other than in the field of politics. His anti-Mendelian fanaticism, and his fervent, dogmatic belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, would have been harmlessly ignored in most civilized countries. Unfortunately he happened to live in a country where ideology mattered more than scientific truth. In 1940 he was appointed director of the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Union, and he became immensely influential. His ignorant views on genetics became the only ones allowed to be taught in Soviet schools for a generation. Incalculable damage was done to Soviet agriculture. Many distinguished Soviet geneticists were banished, exiled or imprisoned. For example, N. I. Vavilov, a geneticist of worldwide reputation, died of malnutrition in a windowless prison cell after a prolonged trial on ludicrously trumped up charges such as ‘spying for the British’.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Blue-Machine":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Blue-Machine","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Evolution/The Blue Machine.md","title":"The Blue Machine","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","concentration","biology","biosphere","global-warming","titanic","ocean","seawater","salt","water"],"content":"The Blue Machine\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book contains a lot of fun stories about the ocean and how the biosphere work. It is quite informative and nice to read.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked it a lot.\nThe way life has adapted to the salty ocean is quite astonishing.\nAnother thing I thought was quite interesting is the fact how nutrition is extremely important for wildlife in the ocean, and small things such as whale feces affect the entire eco-system.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nBut before we reach for the grandest perspective of the Earth’s blue machine, we need to understand the major physical influences that make it work: temperature, salinity, density and spin.\n\n\nThe Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes parked in a region of ocean that’s 4–5 kilometres deep.\n\n\nBut the sun makes up 99.86 per cent of the total mass of the solar system, and although you could argue that 99 per cent of the variety is found in the planets, our solar system is really one massive nuclear reactor surrounded by spherical specks of dust that it can’t shake off.\n\n\nAt the sun’s heart, 4 million tonnes of matter is converted into energy every single second as colossal temperatures and pressures force hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium atoms.\n\n\nBritain imported all that it could get, and by 1960 half of all fishmeal was being used as pig food. With the addition of industrial farming methods and antibiotics, farmers could grow more pigs more quickly, in less space and for less money.\n\n\nBy the 1850s, half of Peru’s guano exports (200,000 tons of the stuff) ended up in Britain; it was the only manure British farmers bought in significant quantities.\n\n\nAn adult human body contains around 200 grams of salt, and this isn’t a passive cargo.\n\n\nHe was one of the founding members of the Royal Society (and its precursor the ‘Invisible College’), completely embodying its motto Nullius in verba, usually translated as ‘Take nobody’s word for it’.\n\n\nIt had one overall conclusion: the amount of salt in seawater might vary from place to place, but the ratio of all the major components (sodium, chloride, magnesium, potassium, etc.) was always the same,fn24 in every ocean and at every depth.\n\n\nOne litre of seawater contains 18.9 grams of chloride, 10.6 grams of sodium, 2.6 grams of sulphate, 1.3 grams of magnesium, 0.4 grams of calcium and 0.4 grams of potassium, along with tiny traces of lots of other elements.fn27\n\n\nAt a molecular level, the turtle isn’t too different from us. The average salinity of her body is around a third that of seawater, and her reptilian kidneys can’t produce urine that has a higher salt concentration than her blood. Her body is a neat package of low-salinity life, and her cells will fail if her insides come anywhere near the salinity of the water in which she swims. Her leathery skin is the fortress that keeps the salt out.\n\n\nThese whales feed on fish, and those fish are much less salty than the ocean. As they’re digested, their carbohydrate and fat release water, and the fish themselves contain useful water in their cells. So if a whale is careful, squeezing out the seawater that comes with each mouthful of fish before it swallows, it can get enough water from its food without taking in too much extra salt. We don’t yet know for certain, but it seems likely that whales don’t need to drink.\n\n\nA jellyfish is really just a small bucketful of ocean masquerading as life. It’s 96 per cent water, and most of the other 4 percent is salt, making the jellyfish as salty as the ocean. Less than 1 percent of the jellyfish is organic material and, therefore useful food.\n\n\nAnd so she must eat and eat and eat, stuffing herself with 80 percent of her own body weight in nutrient-poor jelly every single day. And the cost adds up – she takes in more than 10 kilos of salt every single day. How could any animal survive that without shrivelling up from the inside out?\n\n\nLeatherback tears are thick and viscous and almost twice as salty as the ocean. To keep eating without killing herself with salt, the turtle must cry around eight litres of tears every hour.\n\n\nThe Pacific basin alone contains 52 percent of all the water on Earth, but there are no boundaries between the water that happens to be in that basin and the ocean anywhere else.\n\n\nThe phenomenon of dead water occurs when the depth of the top layer, and the speed and size of the ship, hit a critical combination. When everything is just right (or just wrong, if you’re the one trying to go somewhere), the submerged wake generated in the water layers beneath the ship – the internal wave – becomes a fixed dip that sits right beneath the ship, and the ship must keep putting in the energy to drag that wave along. There isn’t much to see at the surface, but it takes a huge amount of energy to maintain the internal wave, which the ship must carry along like an unwelcome extra anchor.\n\n\nMany expeditions have returned to the Titanic since 1985, and the entire debris field has now been surveyed. The ship broke in half at the surface and sank in a single location, but the debris is spread over an area approximately 5 kilometres long and 8 kilometres wide. It seems likely that as the front half of the ship sank, its shape caused it to glide forwards, sending it away from the stern.\n\n\nAs the tides move, they drag on the Earth, leaching energy away from the orbital system so that the Earth’s rotation slows by about 17 milliseconds each year, and the moon gets about 4 centimetres further away every year. This reduces the amount of energy in the Earth–moon system and provides the source of energy to move the tides.\n\n\nIt’s estimated that 76 percent of species in the open ocean can generate their own light (known as bioluminescence), and we are only just starting to untangle the billions of flashes, flickers, pulses, patterns and distractions that are sent and received every second under the waves.\n\n\nKrill, which are plentiful in the Southern Ocean, generate light on their underside to help disguise them against the bright sky above.\n\n\nWhaling really took off in the 1950s and 1960s, when many tens of thousands of whales were slaughtered every year. And the whales certainly knew what was going on. Their cortisol, the stress hormone, follows almost exactly the same pattern as the number of whales caught, reaching a painfully high peak that coincides with the whaling peak in the 1960s.\n\n\nAn old Spanish word for tortoise is galápago\n\n\nFritz Haber was a German chemist who left a very complex legacy when he died in 1934. He unlocked the way to feed a ballooning human population when he invented a method for synthesizing ammonia and therefore artificial fertilizers (providing an alternative to the bird poo we considered in chapter 2). It’s estimated that this invention alone supports half the global population today.\n\n\nThere are two broad categories of plankton: the phytoplankton, which are the sun-harvesters, and the zooplankton, which eat other organisms to survive. But because ocean life is complicated, there are plenty of organisms that do both, depending on the circumstances.\n\n\nCyanobacteria like Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. These are tiny globules, too small to have a complex structure, and the smallest known organism that can photosynthesize.\n\n\nPut a Range Rover next to a grain of couscous and you have some idea of the range of plankton sizes.\n\n\nRecent research has confirmed that the basic rule of the ocean is that each time you go down the size scale by a factor of ten, the total biomass in that size category is the same, and there are just ten times as many individuals. This includes all forms of life: crustaceans, fish, marine mammals, bacteria, sea stars and everything else; you put each one in its size category, add it all up across the entire ocean, and the mass of life is the same in each category.\n\n\nEvery time you see one big fish, it’s worth visualizing how large the biological foundation it rests on is: around eighteen times the mass of the fish you’re looking at.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Case-Against-Reality-Why-Evolution-Hid-the-Truth-from-Our-Eyes":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Case-Against-Reality-Why-Evolution-Hid-the-Truth-from-Our-Eyes","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Evolution/The Case Against Reality Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.md","title":"The Case Against Reality Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes","links":[],"tags":["books","non-fiction","biology","evolution","philosophy","quantum-physics","reality","surrealism","absurdism"],"content":"The Case Against Reality Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about understanding how the world as we perceive it is not based on truth, but fitness. Fitness is the maximisation of survivability. It takes our cognitive science and applies the acid of Darwin´s theory of evolution to it.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked the book for sure. I had good experiences reading it, and it resonated with me.\nI found the impact of this book to be quite profound, as I have thought about the books premise a lot after reading and understand more about the actual impact of the teachings of the book.\nSeeing everything through the lens of: “We are evolved to look at things this way,” rather than “This is the way things are” has drastically changed my perception of the world.\nI got a new way of thinking about how we are perceiving the world. Fitness beats the truth.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nEach hemisphere has 43 billion neurons.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we differ from rocks in two key respects. First, we experience sensations. We taste chocolate, suffer headaches, smell garlic, hear trumpets, see tomatoes, feel dizzy, and enjoy orgasms. If rocks have orgasms, they’re not letting on. Second, we have “propositional attitudes,” such as the belief that rocks don’t have headaches, the fear that stocks might fall, the wish to vacation in Tahiti, and the wonder why Chris won’t\n\n\nDouble helix of DNA, which proved the vitalists wrong. This structure, with its four-letter code and penchant for replication, brilliantly solved the problem of cooking up life, mechanistically, from purely physical ingredients.\n\n\nCats can’t do calculus and monkeys can’t do quantum theory, so why assume that Homo sapiens can demystify consciousness?\n\n\nBut evolution disagrees. We will see in chapter four that evolution by natural selection entails a counterintuitive theorem: the probability is zero that we see reality as it is\n\n\nCentury after Hume, Darwin laid the foundation—evolution by natural selection—for a psychology that explains why: beauty is a perception of fitness payoffs on offer, such as the payoff for eating that apple or dating that person.\n\n\nMale jewel beetles, Julodimorpha bakewelli, have a thing for beautiful females.\nThe males fly about, searching for females, which are shiny, dimpled, and brown. Recently, some male primates of the Homo sapiens species have been driving through the beetle’s haunts in Western Australia and littering the outback with emptied beer bottles, known as “stubbies.” As it happened, some of the stubbies were shiny, dimpled, and just the right shade of brown to catch the fancy of male beetles. Forsaking real females, the male beetles swooned over stubbies with their genitalia everted, and doggedly tried to mate despite glassy rebuffs. (A classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.) Adding injury to insult, ants of the species Iridomyrmex discors learned to loiter near stubbies, wait for the befuddled and priapistic beetles, and then devour them, genitalia first, as they failed to have their way. The poor beetles teetered on extinction, and Australia had to change its beer bottles to save its beetles.\n\n\nIt’s all about struggles between genes. Which is to say, it’s all about fitness—the central concept of evolution by natural selection. Genes that are more adept at elbowing their way into the next generation are said to be fitter.\n\n\nOscar Wilde understood this logic well. “Moderation,” he wrote, “is a fatal thing… . Nothing succeeds like excess.”\n\n\nThe white sclera of the human eye advertises gaze direction, making it a tool for social communication. It also advertises emotion and health. The sclera is covered by the conjunctiva, a thin membrane containing tiny blood vessels.\n\n\nDiscovery that genes influence our emotions and behaviour does not justify an oppressive status quo any more than the discovery that genes influence cancer justifies cancer.\n\n\nThe term qualia is sometimes used by philosophers to refer to subjective, conscious experiences—what it’s like to see the redness of red or smell the aroma of coffee.\n\n\nThis is spelled out in the Fitness-Beats-Truth (FBT) Theorem, which I conjectured and Chetan Prakash proved.\n\n\nDennett was right—Darwin’s idea is a “universal acid: it eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionised world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognisable, but transformed in fundamental ways.”\n\n\nSimilarly, the psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have found that our logical reasoning works best when we argue with others.\n\n\nPlayers of Minecraft grow ever more adept at dealing with its worlds. But they do so by mastering an interface, not by growing ever closer to the truth.\n\n\nEver since 1911, when Ernest Rutherford discovered that the atom is mostly empty space, with just a tiny nucleus at its center, physicists have told us that reality is quite different from what we see.\n\n\nThis confluence of physics and evolution has not been obvious. In 1987, William Bartley described a conference in which the physicist John Wheeler presented his take on quantum theory. Sir Karl Popper, a famous philosopher of science, “turned to him and quietly said: ‘What you say is contradicted by biology.’ It was a dramatic moment… . And then the biologists … broke into delighted applause. It was as if someone had finally said what they had been thinking.”\n\n\nQuantum theory smashed our intuitions about objects, by denying that they have definite values of physical properties that are independent of whether, or how, they are observed.\n\n\n“There is no spoon.” —SPOON BOY, THE MATRIX\n\n\nScience can demystify the exotic. This talent leads to new technology—from cell phones to satellites—which can seem, in the words of Arthur C. Clarke, “indistinguishable from magic.” Science can also mystify the mundane. It can plunge us without warning down a rabbit hole of the curious and curiouser.\n\n\nNathan Seiberg of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton said, “I am almost certain that space and time are illusions. These are primitive notions that will be replaced by something more sophisticated.”\n\n\nFor instance, Dennis Proffitt and his collaborators found that people given a drink containing glucose make shorter estimates of distance than those given a drink containing no carbohydrates (and, instead, an artificial sweetener); people who are more aerobically fit make shorter estimates of distance than those who are less fit. This suggests that our perception of a distance depends not just on the energy cost, but rather on the ratio of the energy cost to our available energy.\n\n\nTwo dimensions contain all the information in any 3D space.\n\n\nMost plants have a blue receptor that regulates their circadian rhythms, such as their daily opening and closing of leaves. This receptor, cryptochrome, is the same receptor that regulates the circadian rhythms of animals, including humans.\n\n\nPlants can also get “jet lag.” If you artificially shift the time of day when they receive blue light, they take a few days to adjust their rhythms, so that their leaves again open and close in synchrony with the light.\n\n\nWatson’s interface was no less dynamic than ours: “The shape changes with each moment, just as flavor does… . French cooking is my favorite precisely because it makes the shapes change in fabulous ways.”\n\n\nPhenomenon known as “change blindness.” We hunt in vain, until we happen to stumble upon a difference, whereupon we can’t help but see it thereafter.\n\n\nA male Homo sapiens doesn’t just like a female with breast implants as much as a female au naturel; if the implants impart an upper convexity not seen in nature, he likes it far more. A caricature of a face isn’t just identified as well as a photograph, it is identified more quickly.\n\n\nEvolution shapes the perceptions of an organism to track fitness—not truth—as cheaply as possible given the demands of its niche. Supernormal stimuli hint at the resulting codes for fitness. In its niche, a herring-gull chick can succeed with a simple code: a larger red disk means a better chance for food.\n\n\n“Silence is the language of god, all else is poor translation.” —JALALUDDIN RUMI\n\n\n“Cognitive neuroscience reveals that the vast majority of our mental processes are unconscious. We are unaware of the sophisticated processes by which we understand and produce speech, make decisions, learn, walk, understand, or transform images at the eye into visual worlds. Surely this vast swath of unconscious processing contradicts the claim of conscious realism that reality consists entirely of conscious agents.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Evolution-of-Everything":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Evolution/The-Evolution-of-Everything","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Evolution/The Evolution of Everything.md","title":"The Evolution of Everything","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","evolution","society","progress"],"content":"The Evolution of Everything\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nTHis book is about the growth of the world, and argues that the human society grows evolutionary, rather than revolutionary.

The best adaptations spread through time and space, in turn spurring further innovation in a process Richard Dawkins aptly called, “The Greatest Show on Earth.”\n\n\nThey anchor life in the wild, too: seed plants now make up more than 90 percent of our flora.

In this individual’s defense, however, I must confess that I had been poking it with a stick.\n\n\nWith her “baby in a box” analogy, Carol neatly captured the essence of seeds: portable, protected, and well-nourished.\n\n\nA seed contains three basic elements: the embryo of a plant (the baby), a seed coat (the box), and some kind of nutritive tissue (the lunch).\n\n\nTechnically, germination refers only to that instant of awakening between water uptake and the first cell expansion, but most people use the term more broadly.\n\n\nFor avocados, that stored food includes everything from starch and protein to fatty oils and pure sugar—a mixture so rich that nurseries don’t even bother with fertilizers until well beyond the seedling stage.\n\n\nThey contained grass, too—a tall, Middle Eastern species in the genus Triticum that we know by the name of wheat.\n\n\nEven Antarctica boasts native grasses, and if you lined up all the flowering plants on earth, nearly one in twenty would be a grass.\n\n\nIt wasn’t the type of food that mattered, but how it was prepared. “I became convinced that we cannot survive in the wild on raw food. As a species, we are entirely dependent on using fire for food preparation. We are the cooking ape.”\n\n\nHe told me about the remarkable energy gain achieved through cooking—how roasting or boiling meats, nuts, tubers, and other primate foods increased digestibility by anywhere from a third for wheat and oats to as much as 78 percent for a chicken egg.\n\n\nPeople near the Sea of Galilee were using stone tools to grind and process wild barley over 20,000 years ago, and in Mozambique, similar methods put sorghum on the menu 105,000 years ago.\n\n\nRome first saw Egyptian production diverted to Constantinople, and then lost the rest of its supplies when Carthage fell to the Vandals. Prices skyrocketed, and major food riots and famines rocked the capital at least fourteen times in the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n\nAfter all, the average rat travels only a few hundred yards from its birthplace over the course of a lifetime, so how did the illness move from China to India and the Middle East and all the way north to Scandinavia in a matter of years? The answer lies not in the ranging habits of rats, but in their diet. While black rats will eat almost anything, they thrive on grain of all types and travel with it wherever it goes.\n\n\nGod gives the nuts, but he does not crack them. —German Proverb\n\n\nAnd while it’s tempting to chalk up Almond Joys to the same logic that Benjamin Franklin used for beer—“proof that God loves us”\n\n\nThe term fracking refers to an oil and natural gas extraction process known in the industry by its full name, hydraulic fracturing.\n\n\nLike any other new adaptation, seeds began as an oddity, bit players in a much larger drama. They appeared in the first years of the Carboniferous Period (360–286 million years ago), a time when most plants reproduced by spores.\n\n\n“Never argue with a fool—an onlooker can’t tell the difference.”\n\n\nSelecting plants with edible side buds and flower shoots produced Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli, while nurturing a fattened stem produced kohlrabi.\n\n\nAssyrians began meticulously hand-pollinating date palms more than 4,000 years ago, and as early as the Shang Dynasty (1766–1122 BC), Chinese winemakers had perfected a strain of millet that required protection from cross-pollination\n\n\nMende people of Sierra Leone, whose verb for “experiment” comes from the phrase “trying out new rice.”\n\n\nBecause while they may live in the tropics and grow 150 feet tall, almendro trees also belong to the pea family and come festooned with purple flowers.\n\n\nIf Silva returned today, he could take a cable car to the top, and he would find the phrase “Masada Shall Not Fall Again” emblazoned on everything from t-shirts to coffee mugs.\n\n\nOver time, most plants developed the habit of holding onto their seeds longer and drying them out, reducing water content by as much as 95 percent. This remains the single most important factor in slowing down a seed’s metabolism,\n\n\nThe name “rodent” comes from the Latin verb rodere, “to gnaw,” a reference both to the way rodents chew and to the massive incisors that help them do it so well.\n\n\nFor rodents, unlocking the nutrition in seeds turned out to be an evolutionary gold mine: they quickly became the most numerous and diverse group of mammals on the planet.\n\n\nOn the second voyage, he found every member of his new colony on Hispaniola murdered by natives.\n\n\nManage that feat. History remembers Columbus for his epoch-making first trip across the Atlantic and for helping usher in a new era of exploration and conquest.

On the second voyage, he found every member of his new colony on Hispaniola murdered by natives.\n\n\nDried and ground or added whole, the fruits and seeds of Capsicum chili peppers now flavor everything from Thai curries to Hungarian goulash to African groundnut stew. From four wild species native to the New World, over 2,000 cultivars have been developed, ranging in spiciness from the mildest paprika to the fieriest habañero and beyond.

The standard recipe featured steaming-hot ale poured over bread or mush, with eggs, butter, cheese, or sugar added on special occasions. This concoction provided people of all ages with carbohydrates, calories, and, although the beer was usually weak, a modest buzz.\n\n\nAs late as the seventeenth century, when coffee began to take hold, per capita beer consumption in northern Europe ranged from 156 to as much as 700 liters annually, with 300 to 400 liters considered average. Modern figures pale by comparison—Americans drink a paltry 78 liters per year, the British put away 74, and even the beer-loving Germans knock back only 107.\n\n\nCoffee beans contain at least 800 other compounds in addition to caffeine—making that daily cup, by some accounts, the most chemically complex food in the human diet.\n\n\nNamed warfarin after the group that funded the research (the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation), this modified coumarin quickly became the most widely used rat poison in the world. Mixed in with a tempting food bait, it kills rodents by causing anemia, hemorrhaging, and uncontrollable internal bleeding. But in people, a small dose thins the blood just enough to prevent dangerous clots inside the veins, one of the most common and deadly side effects of cancer and its treatment.

This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells.\n\n\n“Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat,”\n\n\nIt helped that Mayer promoted his pro-exercise message with a fervor akin to a moral crusade. And as Mayer’s political influence grew through the 1960s, this contributed to the appearance that his faith in the weight-reducing benefits of exercise was widely shared. In 1966, when the U.S. Public Health Service first advocated dieting and increased physical activity as the keys to weight loss, Mayer wrote the report.\n\n\nThey’re taking a law of nature that says absolutely nothing about why we get fat and a phenomenon that has to happen if we do get fat—overeating—and assuming these say all that needs to be said. This was a common error in the first half of the twentieth century. It’s become ubiquitous since. We need to look elsewhere for answers.\n\n\n“Obesity is a complex, multifactorial chronic disease that develops from an interaction of genotype and the environment,”\n\n\nThe most fattening foods are the ones that have the greatest effect on our blood sugar and insulin levels. These are the concentrated sources of carbohydrates, and particularly those that we can digest quickly: anything made of refined flour (bread, cereals, and pasta), liquid carbohydrates (beers, fruit juices, and sodas), and starches (potatoes, rice, and corn\n\n\nImagine how many more dead diabetics we’d have if victims of that disease were treated by psychologists instead of physicians.\n\n\nWhen people accumulate excess fat, this tells us that something has gone awry in the careful regulation of their fat tissue. What we need to know is what that defect is and what to do about it.\n\n\nObesity can be caused by a regulatory defect so small that it would be undetectable by any technique yet invented.\n\n\nWhatever makes us both fatter and heavier will also make us overeat. This was the ultimate lesson of Wade’s rats. It may be counterintuitive, but it has to be true for every species, for every person who puts on pounds of fat. It’s arguably the one lesson we (and our health experts) have to learn in order to understand why we get fat and what to do about it.\n\n\nVon Bergmann’s approach to obesity was straightforward: he considered it a disorder of excess fat accumulation and then set out to learn what he could about the regulation of our fat tissue.\n\n\nAs it happens, fat is continuously flowing out of our fat cells and circulating around the body to be used for fuel and, if it’s not used for fuel, returned to the fat cells. This goes on regardless of whether we’ve recently eaten or exercised. In 1948, after this science was worked out in detail, Ernst Wertheimer, a German biochemist who had emigrated to Israel and is considered the father of the field of fat metabolism, put it this way: “Mobilization and deposition of fat go on continuously, without regard to the nutritional state of the animal.”\n\n\nInsulin plays many roles in the human body, but one critical role is to keep blood sugar under control. You’ll start secreting insulin (from the pancreas) even before you start eating—indeed, it’s stimulated just by thinking about eating\n\n\nIn a world without cigarettes, lung cancer would be a rare disease, as it once was. In a world without carbohydrate-rich diets, obesity would be a rare condition as well.\n\n\nPutting fat on below the waist and behind them also balances the weight of the child growing in their womb in front.\n\n\n(Insulin also tells muscle cells and others in the body not to burn fatty acids but to continue burning up blood sugar instead.) This means that when fatty acids do escape from a fat cell, if insulin levels happen to be high, these fatty acids won’t be taken up by the muscle cells and used for fuel. They’ll end up back in the fat tissue.\n\n\nBecause the insulin level in the bloodstream is determined primarily by the carbohydrates that are consumed—their quantity and quality, as I’ll discuss—it’s those carbohydrates that ultimately determine how much fat we accumulate. Here’s the chain of events: You think about eating a meal containing carbohydrates. You begin secreting insulin. The insulin signals the fat cells to shut down the release of fatty acids (by inhibiting HSL) and take up more fatty acids (via LPL) from the circulation. You start to get hungry, or hungrier. You begin eating. You secrete more insulin. The carbohydrates are digested and enter the circulation as glucose, causing blood sugar levels to rise. You secrete still more insulin. Fat from the diet is stored as triglycerides in the fat cells, as are some of the carbohydrates that are converted into fat in the liver. The fat cells get fatter, and so do you. The fat stays in the fat cells until the insulin level drops.*\n\n\nSo, on seeing the lion, you secrete adrenaline, and the adrenaline, among other things, signals your fat tissue to dump fatty acids into the circulation. These fatty acids, ideally, will then provide all the fuel you need to make your escape. In this sense, every hormone but insulin works to release fat from our fat tissue. They make us leaner, at least temporarily.\n\n\nThis belief in the carbohydrate as “heart-healthy” started in the 1960s and it couldn’t be reconciled with the idea that carbohydrates make us fat. After all, if dietary fat causes heart attacks, then a diet that replaces carbohydrates with more fatty foods threatens to kill us, even if it slims us down in the process.\n\n\nThese foods are also, almost invariably, the cheapest calories available. This is the conspicuous explanation for why the poorer we are, the fatter we’re likely to be; why, as I discussed at the outset, it’s all too easy to find extremely poor populations, past and present, with obesity and diabetes rates that rival those in the United States and Europe today\n\n\n“It is often said and not without reason,” as Pavlov wrote more than a century ago, “that ‘hunger is the best sauce.’\n\n\nAll food does this to some extent, because that’s what the reward system apparently evolved to do: reinforce behaviors (eating and sex) that benefit the species. But sugar seems to hijack the signal to an unnatural degree, just as cocaine and nicotine do. If we believe the animal research, then sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are addictive in the same way that drugs are and for much the same biochemical reasons.*\n\n\nNow, how’s that for a vicious cycle? The foods that make us fat also make us crave precisely the foods that make us fat. (This, again, is little different from smoking: the cigarettes that give us lung cancer also make us crave the cigarettes that give us lung cancer.)\n\n\nBanting credited Harvey for the diet, but it was Banting’s name that entered the English language (and the Swedish) as a verb meaning “to diet,” and it was Banting who took the heat from the medical community.\n\n\nOn average, we get 15 percent of our calories from protein, 33 percent from fat, and the remainder (more than 50 percent) from carbohydrates. But these modern hunter-gatherers ate quite differently, and so in all probability did our Paleolithic ancestors.\n\n\nTheir diets were high to very high in protein compared with today (19 to 35 percent of calories), and high to very high in fat (28 to 58 percent of calories).\n\n\nNutritionists will say that 120 to 130 grams of carbohydrates are required in a healthy diet, but this is because they confuse what the brain and central nervous system will burn for fuel when diets are carbohydrate rich—120 to 130 grams daily—with what we actually have to eat.\n\n\nAnd this is why severely carbohydrate-restricted diets are known as “ketogenic” diets. The rest of the energy required will come from glycerol, which is also being released from the fat tissue when the triglycerides are broken down into their component parts, and from glucose synthesized in the liver from the amino acids in protein.\n\n\nThat the official embrace of low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets coincided not with a national decline in weight and heart disease but with epidemics of both obesity and diabetes\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/A-Mind-for-Numbers-How-to-Excel-at-Math-and-Science":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/A-Mind-for-Numbers-How-to-Excel-at-Math-and-Science","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Math/A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science.md","title":"A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science","links":[],"tags":["books","mathematics","learning","productivity","productivity-hack","school"],"content":"A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis is not a book about excelling at math and science; it is a book about excelling at learning.

We’ll call the thinking processes related to these two different types of networks the focused mode and diffuse mode, respectively—these modes are highly important for learning.\n\n\nFocused-mode thinking is essential for studying math and science.\n\n\nDiffuse-mode thinking is also essential for learning math and science. It allows us to suddenly gain a new insight on a problem we’ve been struggling with and is associated with “big-picture” perspectives.\n\n\nRelated to these difficulties in math and science is another challenge. It’s called the Einstellung effect (pronounced EYE-nshtellung). In this phenomenon, an idea you already have in mind, or your simple initial thought, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.\n\n\nBut as long as we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the diffuse mode.\n\n\nIf you often find yourself procrastinating, as many of us do, here’s a tip. Turn off your phone and any sounds or sights (or websites) that might signal an interruption. Then set a timer for twenty-five minutes and put yourself toward doing a twenty-five-minute interlude of work focused on a task—any task. Don’t worry about finishing the task—just worry about working on it. Once the twenty-five minutes is up, reward yourself with web surfing, checking your phone, or whatever you like to do. This reward is as important as the work itself.\n\n\nThe key is to do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem.\n\n\nAlexander Williamson, observed that a solitary walk was worth a week in the laboratory in helping him progress in his work.\n\n\nOnce you are distracted from the problem at hand, the diffuse mode has access and can begin pinging about in its big-picture way to settle on a solution.\n\n\nWon’t work.”10 Mistakes are inevitable.

After all, you’ve got the problem there to speak to you, telling you what you need to do next. In that sense, problem solving in math and science is like dance. In dance, you can feel your body hinting at the next move.\n\n\n“In the classroom and elsewhere, students should maximize the amount they learn per unit time spent studying or practicing—that is, they should get the most bang for the buck. How can students do this? The scientific literature provides an unequivocal answer: Rather than devote a long session to the study or practice of the same skill or concept so that overlearning occurs, students should divide their effort across several shorter sessions.\n\n\nFirst things first. Unlike procrastination, which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by because it uses a lot of neural resources. This means that the last thing you want to do in tackling procrastination is to go around spraying willpower on it like it’s cheap air freshener. You shouldn’t waste willpower on procrastination except when absolutely necessary! Best of all, as you will see, you don’t need to.\n\n\nProcrastination expert Rita Emmett explains: “The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself.”\n\n\nProcrastination is a single, monumentally important “keystone” bad habit.\n\n\nProcrastination is like addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from boring reality.\n\n\nWe procrastinate about things that make us feel uncomfortable. But what makes us feel good temporarily isn’t necessarily good for us in the long run.\n\n\nHabit is an energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.\n\n\nThe key to rewiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful. Some students make it a habit to leave their smartphone in their car when they head in for class, which removes a potent distraction.\n\n\nProcess means the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time—as in, “I’m going to spend twenty minutes working.” Product is an outcome—for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish.\n\n\nYour challenge here is to avoid focusing on the product—the solved homework problems. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the process, the small chunks of time you need over days or weeks, to solve the homework problems or prepare for tests.\n\n\nI can give you on dealing with procrastination is to ignore distractions! Of course, setting yourself up so that distractions are minimal is also a good idea.\n\n\nIn Pomodoro-type timer systems, the process, which involves simple focused effort, moves to the forefront. You disconnect from being stuck on any one item and can get into a state of automaticity without concerns about having to finish anything.9 This automaticity appears to allow you to more easily access diffuse-mode capabilities. By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself (Am I getting closer to finishing?) and allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.\n\n\nRemember, research has shown that the more effort you put into recalling material, the deeper it embeds itself into your memory.\n\n\n“We trick ourselves into doing what we ought to be doing… . To a great degree, the highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives .\n\n\nA short, helpful guide to getting started with meditation is Buddha in Blue Jeans by Tai Sheridan. It’s free as an electronic book and is suitable for people of any faith.\n\n\nA last important trick is to reframe your focus. One student, for example, is able to get himself up at four thirty each weekday morning, not by thinking about how tired he is when he wakes but about how good breakfast will be.\n\n\n“From my acne research I learned that self-experimentation can be used by non-experts to (a) see if the experts are right and (b) learn something they don’t know. I hadn’t realized such things were possible\n\n\n“A tip I have to address procrastination is to isolate yourself from things you know will distract you, including people. Go to a room all alone, or the library so you do not have anything to distract you.”\n\n\nWriting the list before you go to sleep enlists your zombies to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day.\n\n\nThe best way for you to gain control of your habits is simple: Once a week, write a brief weekly list of key tasks. Then, each day, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish. Try to write this daily task list the evening before. Why the day before? Research has shown this helps your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you figure out how to accomplish them.\n\n\nNotice my goal finish time for the day: 5:00 P.M. Doesn’t seem right, does it? But it is right, and it is one of the most important components of your daily planner-journal. Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time. Generally, I aim to quit at 5:00 P.M.,\n\n\nTime after time, those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill.11 Once you’ve finished your daily list, you’re done for the day.\n\n\nPlanning for Success Pick a small portion of a task you have been avoiding. Plan where and when you will tackle that portion of the task. Will you go to the library in the afternoon, leaving your cell phone on airplane mode?\n\n\n30/30—combines timers with a task list: 3030.binaryhammer.com/\n\n\nFreedom—many people swear by this program, available for MacOS, Windows, and Android ($10):\n\n\n43 Things—a goal-setting site: www.43things.com/ StickK—a goal-setting site: www.stickk.com/ Coffitivity—modest background noise similar to a coffee shop: coffitivity.com/\n\n\nEspecially when it comes to learning math and science, the bingeing excuse, “I do my best work under deadlines,” is simply not true.\n\n\nCouch, and a cracked egg dribbling off the edge of the coffee table. In other words, you’d imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, coupled with shockingly memorable images of what you might want to remember. Let’s say you are trying to remember the mineral hardness scale, which ranges from 1 to 10 (talc 1, gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10). You can come up with a memory sentence mnemonic: Terrible Giants Can Find Alligators or Quaint Trolls Conveniently Digestible. The problem is that it can still be difficult to remember the sentence. But things become easier if you then add the memory palace. At your front door, there is a terrible giant there, holding a can. Once inside, you find an alligator… . You get the idea. If you are studying finance, economics, chemistry, or what-have-you, you’d use the same approach.\n\n\nMetaphors are never perfect. But then, all scientific models are just metaphors, which means they also break down at some point.2 But never mind that—metaphors (and models!) are vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the mathematical or scientific process or concept that you are trying to understand.\n\n\nRemember—people learn by trying to make sense out of information they perceive. They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it to them\n\n\nIt is the practice—particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material—that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more “natural” gifts.\n\n\nLet’s take a few poetic lines from a song by American singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton, called “Mandelbrot Set,” about a famous mathematician, Benoit Mandelbrot. Mandelbrot’s in heaven He gave us order out of chaos, he gave us hope where there was none His geometry succeeds where others fail So if you ever lose your way, a butterfly will flap its wings From a million miles away, a little miracle will come to take you home The essence of Mandelbrot’s extraordinary mathematics is captured in Coulton’s emotionally resonant phrases, which form images that we can see in our own mind’s eye—the gentle flap of a butterfly’s wings that spreads and has effects even a million miles away.\n\n\n“A mathematician who is not at the same time something of a poet will never be a full mathematician.” —German mathematician Karl Weierstrass\n\n\nEinstein’s theories of relativity arose not from his mathematical skills (he often needed to collaborate with mathematicians to make progress) but from his ability to pretend.\n\n\nOne of the most problematic aspects of procrastination—constantly interrupting your focus to check your phone messages, e-mails, or other updates—is that it interferes with transfer\n\n\nMultitasking during the learning process means you don’t learn as deeply—this can inhibit your ability to transfer what you are learning.\n\n\nPersistence is often more important than intelligence.\n\n\nWho could forget brilliant, doomed Évariste Galois who spent the night before he knew he was to die ‘feverishly dashing off his last will and testament, writing against time to glean a few of the great things in his teeming mind before the death which he foresaw could overtake him. Time after time he broke off to scribble in the margin “I have not time; I have not time,” and passed on to the next frantically scrawled outline.’\n\n\n“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” —Physicist Richard Feynman, advising how to avoid pseudo-science that masquerades as science\n\n\n“My research team has found that if you write about your thoughts and feelings about an upcoming test immediately before you take the test, it can lessen the negative impact of pressure on performance. We think that writing helps to release negative thoughts from mind, making them less likely to pop up and distract you in the heat of the moment.\n\n\n“Finally, one reason students sometimes choke on a test is that they frantically dive right in to solving a problem before they’ve really thought about what they are facing. Learning to pause for a few seconds before you start solving a problem or when you hit a roadblock can help you see the best solution path—this can help prevent the ultimate choking feeling when you suddenly realize you’ve spent a lot of time pursuing a dead end.\n\n\nSometimes, as we’ve discovered, your desire to figure things out right now is what prevents you from being able to figure things out.\n\n\nThe locksmith’s secret was that he was privy to the manufacturers’ default settings.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/Finite-and-Infinite-Games":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/Finite-and-Infinite-Games","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Math/Finite and Infinite Games.md","title":"Finite and Infinite Games","links":["tags/books","tags/non-fiction","tags/philosophy","tags/system-thinking","tags/political-science","tags/engineering","Philosophy/Philosophy"],"tags":["books","non-fiction","philosophy","system-thinking","political-science","engineering"],"content":"Finite and Infinite Games\nTags: books non-fiction philosophy system-thinking political-science engineering\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a philosophical book. It is trying to model how humans model nature. It is an interesting but also quite a short read. Thinking in terms of finite and infinite games makes some decisions of humans and society more understandable.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a nice book, I liked it. It felt like a less dense version of the Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\nHow I Discovered It\nCannot remember, was in my reading list.\nWho Should Read It?\nPeople who like Denim Philosophy\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI think more about titles as the result of finite games, I found that quite interesting.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nA finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.\n\n\nOnly one person or team can win a finite game, but the other contestants may well be ranked at the conclusion of play.\n\n\nBegan, nor do they care. They do not care for the reason that their game is not bounded by time.\n\n\nRules are not valid because the Senate passed them, or because heroes once played by them, or because God pronounced them through Moses or Muhammad. They are valid only if and when players freely play by them.\n\n\nIf the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play—else a different game is being played.\n\n\nInfinite players use the rules to regulate the way they will take the boundaries or limits being forced against their play into the game itself.\n\n\n—Since finite games are played to be won, players make every move in a game in order to win it. Whatever is not done in the interest of winning is not part of the game.\n\n\nIf the prize for winning finite play is life, then the players are not properly alive. They are competing for life. Life, then, is not play, but the outcome of play. Finite players play to live; they do not live their playing. Life is therefore deserved, bestowed, possessed, won. It is not lived. “Life itself appears only as a means to life” (Marx).\n\n\nTitles are theatrical. Each title has a specified ceremonial form of address and behavior. Titles such as Captain, Mrs., Lord, Esquire, Professor, Comrade, Father, Under Secretary, signal not only a mode of address with its appropriate deference or respect, but also a content of address (only certain subjects are suitable for discussion with the Admiral of the Fleet or the District Attorney or the Holy Mother), and a manner of address (shaking hands, kneeling, prostrating or crossing oneself, saluting, bowing, averting the eyes, or standing in silence).\n\n\nWe are not defeated by floods or genetic disease or the rate of inflation. It is true that these are real, but we do not play against reality; we play according to reality. We do not eliminate weather or genetic influence but accept them as the realities that establish the context of play, the limits within which we are to play.\n\n\nAll the limitations of finite play are self-limitations.\n\n\nEvil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.\n\n\nWhen Europeans first landed on the North American continent the native population spoke as many as ten thousand distinct languages, each with its own poetry and treasury of histories and myths, its own ways of living in harmony with the spontaneities of the natural environment. All but a very few of those tongues have been silenced, their cultures forever lost to those of us who stand ignorantly in their place.\n\n\nEvil is never intended as evil. Indeed, the contradiction inherent in all evil is that it originates in the desire to eliminate evil. “The only good Indian is a dead Indian.”\n\n\nEvil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion.\n\n\n“We must learn the fine arts of war and independence so that our children can learn architecture and engineering so that their children may learn the fine arts and painting” (John Quincy Adams).\n\n\nWe can imagine infinite players nodding thoughtfully at Rousseau’s famous declaration: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.”\n\n\nLike a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and temporally limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its boundaries are inviolable, and its past is enshrined.\n\n\nSociety is abstract, culture concrete.\n\n\nJust as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition. Since the rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed to and freely altered, a cultural tradition is both adopted and transformed in its adoption.\n\n\nProperly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition; it is a tradition.\n\n\nTitle is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of a particular game. I cannot entitle myself. Titles are theatrical, requiring an audience to bestow and respect them.\n\n\nAll the principal museums in New York, for example, are associated with the names of the famously rich: Carnegie, Frick, Rockefeller, Guggenheim, Whitney, Morgan, Lehman. Such museums are not designed to protect the art from people, but to protect the people from art.\n\n\nFor this reason it can be said that where a society is defined by its boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon.\n\n\nPatriots can flourish only where boundaries are well-defined, hostile, and dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore characteristically associated with the military or other modes of international conflict.\n\n\nWar is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared contest between bounded societies, or states. If a state has no enemies it has no boundaries.\n\n\nSpeaking in purely causal terms, I cannot say I was born; I should say rather that I have emerged as a phase in the process of reproduction. A reproduction is a repetition, a recurrence of that which has been. Birth, on the other hand, in causal terms, is all discontinuity.\n\n\nHaving once been insulted by Athens, the great Persian Emperor Darius renewed his appetite for war by having a page follow him about to whisper in his ear, “Sire, remember the Athenians.”\n\n\nWhatever occurs within a game is relatively intelligible with reference to whatever else has happened inside its boundaries, but it is absolutely intelligible with reference to that world for the sake of which its boundaries exist.\n\n\nNATURE IS the realm of the unspeakable. It has no voice of its own, and nothing to say. We experience the unspeakability of nature as its utter indifference to human culture.\n\n\n“Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed” (Bacon).\n\n\n“One may say ‘the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility’” (Einstein).\n\n\nIndeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak with anyone.\n\n\nThe sicut dixit dominus (thus says the lord) is always a signal for ritual silence.\n\n\nInasmuch as gardens do not conclude with a harvest and are not played for a certain outcome, one never arrives anywhere with a garden. A garden is a place where growth is found. It has its own source of change. One does not bring change to a garden, but comes to a garden prepared for change, and therefore prepared to change. It is possible to deal with growth only out of growth.\n\n\nTrue parents do not see to it that their children grow in a particular way, according to a preferred pattern or scripted stages, but they see to it that they grow with their children.\n\n\nMYTH PROVOKES Explanation but accepts none of it.\n\n\nFides ex auditu. Faith comes by listening, Paul said.\n\n\nA bell resonates, a cannon amplifies. We listen to the bell, we are silenced by the cannon.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/Statistics/A-Field-Guide-to-Lies":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/Statistics/A-Field-Guide-to-Lies","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Math/Statistics/A Field Guide to Lies.md","title":"A Field Guide to Lies","links":["Math/Statistics/Calling-Bullshit"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","calling-bullshit","science"],"content":"A Field Guide to Lies\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is akin to calling bullshit, where it goes through all the ways people fool themselves and others. The book might make you too aware and skeptical of everything.\n🎨 Impressions\nI found it good but not as good as Calling Bullshit. It was thought but lacked the examples that made Calling Bullshit such a good read.\nHow I Discovered It\nCalling bullshit recommended it as well as I had read a book by the author before.\nWho Should Read It?\nNot sure. Depends on how interested you are in data.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI feel like am becoming more and more of a cynic. In the mold of Camus, i try to reject this sarcastic and post-modern view of things and become a more positive person. So what if the world is filled with bullshit, lies, and half-truths.  It is still worth trying to belive more and still worth being positive about things.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIt ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so. —MARK TWAIN\n\n\nStatistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts.\n\n\nResearchers and journalists are not always scrupulous about making this distinction between percentage point and percentages clear, but you should be.\n\n\nThere are three ways of calculating an average, and they often yield different numbers, so people with statistical acumen usually avoid the word average in favor of the more precise terms mean, median, and mode.\n\n\nAnother thing to watch out for in averages is the bimodal distribution. Remember, the mode is the value that occurs most often. In many biological, physical, and social datasets, the distribution has two or more peaks—that is, two or more values that appear more than the others.\n\n\nCum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this). This is a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other.\n\n\nCalculating proportions rather than actual numbers often helps to provide the true frame.\n\n\nAccess is one of those words that should raise red flags when you encounter them in statistics.\n\n\nOne way to lie with statistics is to compare things—datasets, populations, types of products—that are different from one another, and pretend that they’re not. As the old idiom says, you can’t compare apples with oranges.\n\n\nAs Galileo Galilei said, the job of the scientist is to measure what is measurable and to render measurable that which is not. That is, some of the most creative acts in science involve figuring out how to measure something that makes a difference, that no one had figured out how to measure before.\n\n\nStratified random sampling is better than non-stratified.\n\n\nNote that for very large populations—like that of the United States—we only need to sample a very small percentage, in this case, less than .0005 percent. But for smaller populations—like that of a corporation or school—we require a much larger percentage. For a company with 10,000 employees, we’d need to sample 964 (almost 10 percent) to obtain the 3 percent margin with 95 percent confidence, and for a company of 1,000 employees, we’d need to sample nearly 600 (60 percent).\n\n\nAn infamous error was made in the 1936 U.S. presidential election. The Literary Digest conducted a poll and concluded that Republican Alf Landon would win over the incumbent Democrat, President Roosevelt. The Digest had polled people who were magazine readers, car owners, or telephone customers, not a random sample. The conventional explanation, cited in many scholarly and popular publications, is that in 1936, this skewed heavily toward the wealthy, who were more likely to vote Republican. In fact, according to a poll conducted by George Gallup in 1937, this conventional explanation is wrong—car and telephone owners were more likely to back Roosevelt. The bias occurred in that Roosevelt backers were far less likely to participate in the poll. This sampling bias was recognized by Gallup, who conducted his own poll using a random sample, and correctly predicted the outcome. The Gallup poll was born.\n\n\nStudy about political attitudes will skew toward those who are willing to discuss them.\n\n\nTake Gleason grading of tumors—it is only relatively standardized, meaning that you can get different Gleason scores, and hence cancer stage labels, from different pathologists. (In Gleason scoring, a sample of prostate tissue is examined under a microscope and assigned a score from 2 to 10 to indicate how likely it is that a tumor will spread.\n\n\nPhysicists at CERN reported that they had measured neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, a finding that would have been among the most important of the last hundred years.\n\n\nPhysicists at CERN reported that they had measured neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, a finding that would have been among the most important of the last hundred years. They reported later that they had made an error in measurement.\n\n\nGIGO is a famous saying coined by early computer scientists: garbage in, garbage out. At the time, people would blindly put their trust into anything a computer output indicated because the output had the illusion of precision and certainty.\n\n\nMuch of what we read should raise our suspicions. Ask yourself: Is it possible that someone can know this? A newspaper reports the proportion of suicides committed by gay and lesbian teenagers.\n\n\nLots of people bought Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. Indeed, it’s said to be the most purchased and least finished book of the last thirty years.\n\n\nSubjective probability is the only kind of probability that we have at our disposal in practical situations in which there is no experiment, no symmetry equation.\n\n\nA lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies. —ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON\n\n\nEven the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated.\n\n\nPoliticians have been lying at least since Quintus Cicero advised his brother Marcus to do so in 64 B.C.E.\n\n\nPhysics researchers at CERN reported that they had discovered neutrinos traveling faster than light. That would have upended a century of Einsteinian theory. It turns out it was just a loose cable in the linear accelerator that caused a measurement error.\n\n\nThe so-called Mozart effect was discredited because the experiments, showing that listening to Mozart for twenty minutes a day temporarily increased IQ, lacked a control group.\n\n\nMalcolm Gladwell spread an invalid conclusion in his book David and Goliath by suggesting that people with dyslexia might actually have an advantage in life, leading many parents to believe that their dyslexic children should not receive the educational remedies they need. Gladwell fell for the missing control condition. We don’t know how much more successful his chosen dyslexics might have been if they had been able to improve their condition.\n\n\nNature permits us to calculate only probabilities. Yet science has not collapsed. —RICHARD P. FEYNMAN\n\n\nThe lie that terrorists want you to believe is that you are in immediate and great peril.\n\n\nPost hoc, ergo propter hoc (loosely translated, it means “because this happened after that, that must have caused this”).\n\n\nAlthough there was no evidence that thimerosal was linked to autism, it was removed from vaccines in 1992 in Denmark and Sweden, and in the United States starting in 1999, as a “precautionary measure.” Autism rates have continued to increase apace even with the agent removed.\n\n\nScientists called atoms, from the Greek word atomos, for “indivisible.”\n\n\nCum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this).

It is split into defining, identifying, and calling bullshit in the modern world. It is an easy read, with good examples and a skeptical eye on everything.\n🎨 Impressions\nThe book is basically the written version of the authors’ course, but overall, it is such a good overall theme and presented so well that it should almost be required reading in school.\nSo many exciting things, and easy to understand. It is interesting that bullshit is such a widespread phenomenon.\nThe authors have a micro-lecture series on the same topic. \nI wrote a shitty blog post based on that lecture series. \nHow I Discovered It\nI noticed it when I did the course on Calling Bullshit.\nWho Should Read It?\nI think this is a required reading and should be a good read for everyone who deals with data, storytelling, and other things.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI have seen their course already, but it was a good refresher.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nTHE WORLD IS AWASH WITH bullshit, and we’re drowning in it.\n\n\nThe philosopher Harry Frankfurt recognized that the ubiquity of bullshit is a defining characteristic of our time\n\n\nOne of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit.\n\n\nNothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you [thereafter], save only this, that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education.\n\n\nIn one of his Socratic dialogues, Euthydemus, Plato complains that the philosophers known as the Sophists are indifferent to what is actually true and are interested only in winning arguments.\n\n\nSome specialize in eating marine snails, which are protected by hard, thick shells. To smash through these calcite defenses, mantis shrimp have evolved a spring-loading mechanism in their forelimbs that allows them to punch with enormous force. Their hammer-like claws travel 50 mph when they strike. The punch is so powerful that it creates an underwater phenomenon known as cavitation bubbles, a sort of literal Batman “KAPOW!” that results in a loud noise and a flash of light.\n\n\nThis punching power serves another purpose. Mantis shrimp live on shallow reefs, where they\n\n\nMantis shrimp are essentially lobster tails with claws on the front.\n\n\nIt is merely an evolved response, a sort of instinct or reflex. A\n\n\nA sophisticated bullshitter needs a theory of mind—she needs to be able to put herself in the place of her mark. She needs to be able to think about what the others around her do and do not know. She needs to be able to imagine what impression will be created by what sort of bullshit, and to choose her bullshit accordingly.\n\n\nWe impose strong social sanctions on liars. If you get caught in a serious lie, you may lose a friend.\n\n\nWith all of these potential penalties, it’s often better to mislead without lying outright. This is called paltering. If I deliberately lead you to draw the wrong conclusions by saying things that are technically not untrue, I am paltering.\n\n\nWithin linguistics, this notion of implied meaning falls under the area of pragmatics. Philosopher of language H. P. Grice coined the term implicature to describe what a sentence is being used to mean, rather than what it means literally. Implicature allows us to communicate efficiently.\n\n\nIf you claim your toothpaste reduces plaque “by up to” 50 percent, the only way that would be false is if the toothpaste worked too well.\n\n\nThis is bullshit that hides a horrible human toll behind the verbiage of corporate lingo.\n\n\nSoftware engineer Alberto Brandolini in 2014, it states: “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than [that needed] to produce it.”\n\n\n“an idiot can create more bullshit than you could ever hope to refute.”\n\n\nIs not the weaknesses in Wakefield’s paper that prove there is no autism-vaccine link: it is the overwhelming weight of subsequent scientific evidence.\n\n\nBullshit is not only easy to create, it’s easy to spread. Satirist Jonathan Swift wrote in 1710 that “falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it.”\n\n\nTaken together, Brandolini’s principle, Fanelli’s principle, and Swift’s observation tell us that (1) bullshit takes less work to create than to clean up, (2) takes less intelligence to create than to clean up, and (3) spreads faster than efforts to clean it up.\n\n\nOne of the immediately apparent problems with Wakefield’s study was the tiny sample size.\n\n\nOne of the immediately apparent problems with Wakefield’s study was the tiny sample size. His study looked at only twelve children, most of whom reportedly developed the purported syndrome shortly after receiving the MMR vaccine. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to draw meaningful conclusions about rare phenomena from such a tiny sample.\n\n\nStill, Filippo de Strata was right that when the cost of sharing information drops dramatically, we see changes in both the nature of the information available and the ways that people interact with that information.\n\n\nThe invention of new and various kinds of communication has given a voice and an audience to many people whose opinions would otherwise not be solicited, and who, in fact, have little else but verbal excrement to contribute to public issues.\n\n\nA satirical website published a headline proclaiming that “70% of Facebook Users Only Read the Headline of Science Stories before Commenting.” The story began by noting that most people don’t read stories before sharing them on social media either. After a couple of sentences, the text gave way to paragraph after paragraph of the standard “lorem ipsum dolor…”—random text used as filler for webpage layouts. The post was shared tens of thousands of times on social media, and we don’t know how many of those who did so were in on the joke.\n\n\nThe study found that the most successful headlines don’t convey facts, they promise you an emotional experience. The most common phrase among successful Facebook headlines, by nearly twofold, is “will make you,” as in “will break your heart,” “will make you fall in love,” “will make you look twice,” or “will make you gasp in surprise” as above.\n\n\nMIT professor Judith Donath has observed that even when people appear to be talking about other things, they’re often talking about themselves.\n\n\nRiffing on Allen Ginsberg, tech entrepreneur Jeff Hammerbacher complained in 2011 that “the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.”\n\n\nSocial media facilitates the spread of misinformation—claims that are false but not deliberately designed to deceive.\n\n\nIn 2017, Facebook admitted that over the past two years, 126 million US users—half of the adult population and about three-quarters of its US user base—had been exposed to Russian propaganda on the site.\n\n\n“The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.”\n\n\nIn the final days of the 2016 US election, Barack Obama talked extensively about the fake news factories in Macedonia. The people running these factories—often teenagers—created at least 140 popular fake news websites during the election. When a story went viral, it generated huge advertising revenues for the site owners. Some of them were making in excess of 5,000 per month, compared with the average Macedonian monthly salary of 371.\n\n\nBy 2018, Facebook had over two billion legitimate users—but in the same year deleted even more fake accounts: nearly three billion\n\n\nA second approach is governmental regulation. Some countries have already passed laws against creating or spreading fake news, but we worry about this approach for two reasons. First, it runs afoul of the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech. Second, who gets to determine what is fake news? If a leader doesn’t like a story, he or she could declare it fake news and pursue criminal charges against the perpetrators.\n\n\nHarry Frankfurt, the philosopher we introduced in the preface, refined this notion a bit further. He described bullshit as what people create when they try to impress you or persuade you, without any concern for whether what they are saying is true or false, correct or incorrect.\n\n\nThe central theme of this book is that you usually don’t have to open the analytic black box in order to call bullshit on the claims that come out of it.\n\n\nA recent study reports that in the US, unattractive individuals are more likely to be found guilty in jury trials than their attractive peers.\n\n\n“Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning. Red sky at night, sailor’s delight.”\n\n\nUnfortunately, one of the most frequent misuses of data, particularly in the popular press, is to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship based on correlation alone. This is classic bullshit, in the vein of our earlier definition, because often the reporters and editors responsible for such stories don’t care what you end up believing.\n\n\nAfter all, 25 to 29 is a demographic in which the frequency of childbirth differs considerably across socioeconomic strata and geographic regions.\n\n\nPerhaps you already see the problem with this inference. Students aren’t necessarily drinking more beer because they ordered a pitcher. They are probably ordering pitchers because they intend to drink more beer.\n\n\nBut if one is not careful, looking at events chronologically can be misleading. Just because A happens before B does not mean that A causes B—even when A and B are associated. This mistake is so common and has been around for so long that it has a Latin name: post hoc ergo propter hoc. Translated, this means something like “after this, therefore because of it.”\n\n\nVigen finds his spurious correlation examples by collecting a large number of data sets about how things change over time. Then he uses a computer program to compare each trend with every other trend. This is an extreme form of what data scientists call data dredging. With a mere one hundred data series, one can compare nearly ten thousand pairs. Some of these pairs are going to show very similar trends—and thus high correlations—just by chance.\n\n\nThere is a key distinction between a probabilistic cause (A increases the chance of B in a causal manner), a sufficient cause (if A happens, B always happens), and a necessary cause (unless A happens, B can’t happen).\n\n\nWHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, MANIPULATE\n\n\nAssociation does not imply causation either. That said, it is worth noticing that although correlation does not imply causation, causation does imply association. Causation may not generate a linear correlation, but it will generate some sort of association.\n\n\nApproximately 440,000 barrels of whiskey are lost to evaporation in Scotland each year. Most people don’t know how big a whiskey barrel is (about 66 gallons), so we might do better to say that in Scotland, about 29 million gallons are lost every year to the angels. We usually encounter whiskey in 750 ml bottles rather than gallons, so perhaps we would want to report this as a loss of 150 million bottles a year.\n\n\nScotch whiskies lose about 2 percent in volume per year of aging, or roughly 0.005 percent per day.\n\n\nWe are not told how many search queries Google handles per day, but estimates place this figure at about 5.5 billion queries a day. So while 0.25 percent sounds small, it corresponds to well over thirteen million queries a day. These two ways of saying the same thing have very different connotations. If we tell you\n\n\nNumber. In general, we advocate that a percentage change be reported with respect to the starting value.\n\n\nIn general, we advocate that a percentage change be reported with respect to the starting value.\n\n\nCompared to teen drivers without passengers, the relative risk of a teen driver dying in a crash while carrying a passenger over the age of thirty-five is 0.36.\n\n\nThey estimate that, for one year, in people aged 15−95 years, drinking one alcoholic drink a day increases the risk of developing one of the 23 alcohol-related health problems by 0.5%, compared with not drinking at all.\n\n\nThe authors of the study calculated that having a single daily drink would lead to four additional cases of alcohol-related illness per 100,000 people. You would have to have 25,000 people consume one drink a day for a year in order to cause a single additional case of illness.\n\n\nPeople who drink two drinks a day have a relative risk of 1.07 (7 percent higher than nondrinkers) and those who drink five drinks a day have a relative risk of 1.37\n\n\nEven professional scientists sometimes mix up a subtle issue in this regard: the difference between percentages and percentage points. An example is by far the easiest way to illustrate the difference. Suppose that on January 1, the sales tax increases from 4 percent to 6 percent of the purchase price. This is an increase of 2 percentage points: 6% − 4% = 2%. But it is also an increase of 50 percent: The 6 cents that I now pay on the dollar is 50 percent more than the 4 cents I paid previously.\n\n\n*Second, we can put these numbers into context with a well-chosen comparison. Like influenza vaccines in an ineffective year, the use of seatbelts drops the annual risk of injury from “only” about 2 percent to 1 percent.7 Would you trust your health to an MD who advocated a “health tonic” in lieu of seatbelts?\n\n\nIn the year 2000, African Americans composed 12.9 percent of the US population but a staggering 41.3 percent of the inmates in US jails. Given that, it would seem to be good news that between the year 2000 and the year 2005, the fraction of the jail population that was African American declined from 41.3 percent to 38.9 percent. But the real story isn’t as encouraging as the percentage figures seem to indicate. Over this period, the number of African Americans in US jails actually increased by more than 13 percent. But this increase is obscured by the fact that over the same period, the number of Caucasians in US jails increased by an even larger fraction: 27 percent.\n\n\nChanging denominators obscure changes in numerators.\n\n\nThe bounty program failed because people did what people always do at the prospect of a reward: They start gaming the system.\n\n\n*This problem is canonized in a principle known as Goodhart’s law. While Goodhart’s original formulation is a bit opaque,8 anthropologist Marilyn Strathern rephrased it clearly and concisely: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\n\nOnline voters selected truthiness as the word of the year in a 2006 survey run by the publishers of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The term, coined in 2005 by comedian Stephen Colbert, is defined as “the quality of seeming to be true according to one’s intuition, opinion, or perception without regard to logic, factual evidence, or the like.” In its disregard for actual logic and fact, this hews pretty closely to our definition of bullshit.\n\n\nIn other words, mathiness, like truthiness and like bullshit, involves a disregard for logic or factual accuracy.\n\n\nZombie statistics are numbers that are cited badly out of context, are sorely outdated, or were entirely made up in the first place—but they are quoted so often that they simply won’t die.\n\n\nThe original claim was that over 50 percent of papers go uncited, not unread.\n\n\nEven with this correction, the 50 percent figure is inaccurate. First, this number represents the fraction of papers uncited after four years, not the fraction that will remain uncited forever. In some fields, such as mathematics, citations scarcely begin to accrue after four years.\n\n\nGoodhart originally expressed his law as: “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”\n\n\nWe should stress that a sample does not need to be completely random in order to be useful. It just needs to be random with respect to whatever we are asking about.\n\n\nThe ad copy could equivalently read, “Some people will see their insurance premiums go up if they switch to GEICO. Other people will see their premiums stay about the same. Yet others will see their premiums drop. Of these, a few people will see their premiums drop a lot. Of those who see a substantial drop, the average savings is $500.”\n\n\nOne of the most important rules for spotting bullshit: If something seems too good or too bad to be true, it probably is.\n\n\n“One in four Americans will suffer from excessive anxiety at some point,” he explained, “but in my entire career I have only seen one patient who suffered from too little anxiety.”\n\n\n*We will call this the experienced mean class size,4 because it reflects the class sizes that students actually experience.\n\n\nThe same research team found that the strong form holds on Facebook as well: 84 percent of Facebook users have fewer friends than the median friend count of their friends.\n\n\nJob performance was negatively correlated with prior success in programming contests.\n\n\nFive years ago, engineers at Google applied machine learning techniques to their own hiring process, in an effort to identify the most productive employees. They found a surprising result: Job performance was negatively correlated with prior success in programming contests.\n\n\nMathematician Jordan Ellenberg has suggested that a phenomenon called Berkson’s paradox can explain a common complaint.\n\n\nThis is Berkson’s paradox in operation. By selecting for both niceness and attractiveness, you have created a negative correlation between niceness and attractiveness among the people whom you would be willing to date.\n\n\nTwo separate instances of Berkson’s paradox—one involving whom you would date and the other involving who would date you—have created this negative correlation among your potential partners, even though there is no negative trend in the population at large.\n\n\nOnce you start thinking about Berkson’s paradox, you’ll see it all over the place.\n\n\nSelection can have all sorts of interesting consequences, and when trying to understand patterns from data, it is worth thinking about whether there has been any selection bias or deliberate selection operating, and if so, how those factors affect the patterns you observe.\n\n\nIn a clinical trial designed to assess the severity of the side effects of a certain medication, the initial sample of patients may be random, but individuals who suffer side effects may be disproportionately likely to drop out of the trial and thus not be included in the final analysis. This is data censoring, a phenomenon closely related to selection bias.\n\n\nContrary to what everyone assumes, the Florida Stand Your Ground graphic was not intended to mislead. It was just poorly designed. This highlights one of the principles for calling bullshit that we espouse. Never assume malice or mendacity when incompetence is a sufficient explanation, and never assume incompetence when a reasonable mistake can explain things.\n\n\nIn architecture, the term “duck” refers to any building where ornament overwhelms purpose, though it is particularly common in reference to buildings that look like the products they sell.\n\n\nDucks decorate or obscure the meaningful data in a graphic by aiming to be cute. Glass slippers create a false sense of rigor by shoehorning one type of data into a wholly unsuitable data visualization.\n\n\nIt violates what we term the principle of proportional ink: When a shaded region is used to represent a numerical value, the size (i.e., area) of that shaded region should be directly proportional to the corresponding value.\n\n\nWe noted that bar charts are designed to tell stories about magnitudes, whereas line graphs tell stories about changes. Note also that line graphs use positions rather than shaded areas to represent quantities.\n\n\nAgain, this is pure visual bullshit: An element added to the graph to impress the viewer obscures its meaning without adding\n\n\nAgain, this is pure visual bullshit: An element added to the graph to impress the viewer obscures its meaning without adding any additional information.\n\n\n“When modern architects righteously abandoned ornament on buildings they unconsciously designed buildings that were ornament….It is all right to decorate construction, but never to construct decoration”\n\n\nThis, even though the address on each piece of mail has to be read and interpreted. For typewritten addresses, this task is reasonably easy to delegate to machines. Handwriting is harder, but the US postal service has developed a remarkable handwriting recognition system that correctly interprets handwritten addresses 98 percent of the time.\n\n\nComplicated models do a great job of fitting the training data, but simpler models often perform better on the test data than more complicated models. The trick is figuring out just how simple of a model to use. If the model you pick is too simple, you end up leaving useful information on the table.\n\n\nBut extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The idea that homosexual and heterosexual people have differently shaped faces due to prenatal hormone exposure is an extraordinary claim.\n\n\nWhen we train machines to make decisions based on data that arise in a biased society, the machines learn and perpetuate those same biases. In situations like this, “machine learning” might better be called “machine indoctrination.”\n\n\nThis problem with adding additional variables is referred to as the curse of dimensionality. If you add enough variables into your black box, you will eventually find a combination of variables that performs well—but it may do so by chance.\n\n\nOne of the reasons that science works so well is that it is self-correcting. Every claim is open to challenge and every fact or model can be overturned in the face of evidence.\n\n\nShortly thereafter, the Open Science Collaboration—a large-scale collective effort among dozens of researchers—reported that they were able to replicate only 39 out of 100 high-profile experiments in social psychology.\n\n\nLoosely speaking, a p-value tells us how likely it is that the pattern we’ve seen could have arisen by chance alone. If that is highly unlikely, we say that the result is statistically significant.\n\n\nYou and the prosecutor have each stressed different conditional probabilities. A conditional probability is the chance that something is true, given other information.\n\n\nThis confusion is so common that it has its own name, the prosecutor’s fallacy. Our story illustrates why. It can be a matter of life and death in the courtroom, but it’s also a common source of confusion when interpreting the results of scientific studies.\n\n\nScientists are stuck using p-values because they don’t have a good way to calculate the probability of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\n*Purely as a matter of convention, we often use a p-value of 0.05 as a cutoff for saying that a result is statistically significant.7 In other words, a result is statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05, i.e., when it would have less than 5 percent probability of arising due to chance alone.\n\n\nWe sometimes call it the base rate fallacy because it involves ignoring the base rate of the disease in a population when interpreting the results of a test.\n\n\nThe epithet “cafeteria Catholic” suggests a worshipper who picks and chooses from the tenets of the faith, ignoring those that are uncomfortable or unpleasant.\n\n\nSo how do you tell whether a scientific article is legitimate? The first thing to recognize is that any scientific paper can be wrong. That’s the nature of science; nothing is above questioning. No matter where a paper is published, no matter who wrote it, no matter how well supported its arguments may be, any paper can be wrong.\n\n\nWhile it’s an important part of the scientific process, peer review does not guarantee that published papers are correct.\n\n\nScience is a cumulative process. Even though experiments are not often directly replicated, science proceeds when researchers build upon previous results. If a result is false, people cannot build on it effectively. Their attempts will fail, they’ll go back and reassess the original findings, and in this way the truth will come out.\n\n\nOne system, tested by London’s Metropolitan Police, was described as having a 0.1 percent error rate based on its rate of correctly identifying true negatives. But only eight of the twenty-two suspects apprehended by using the system were true positives, for a whopping error rate of 64 percent among the positive results returned.\n\n\n\nIf researchers want to test multiple hypotheses, there are statistical methods such as the Bonferroni correction that allow this. Each individual test then requires stronger evidence to be considered significant, so that there is roughly a one-in-twenty chance that any of the tested hypotheses would appear significant if the null hypothesis were true.*\n\n\n\nJournalists are trained to ask the following simple questions about any piece of information they encounter: Who is telling me this? How does he or she know it? What is this person trying to sell me?\n\n\nThink back to philosopher Harry Frankfurt’s distinction between bullshit and lies. Lies are designed to lead away from the truth; bullshit is produced with a gross indifference to the truth\n\n\nFor a delightful introductory course on Fermi estimation, see Lawrence Weinstein and John A. Adam, Guesstimation (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2008).\n\n\nConfirmation bias is the tendency to notice, believe, and share information that is consistent with our preexisting beliefs\n\n\nIn our experience, patterns based on human behavior tend to be noisy. We might expect to see a general tendency toward one or the other types of description for each gender, but we’d expect some crossover.\n\n\nWe define calling bullshit as follows: Calling bullshit is a performative utterance in which one repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bullshit alone. You can call bullshit on bullshit, but you can also call bullshit on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice.\n\n\n“There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the means by which to detect lies.”\n\n\nReductio ad absurdum. This strategy, which dates back at least to Aristotle, shows how your opponent’s assumptions can lead to ridiculous conclusions.\n\n\nWe heard about a great counterexample raised at a Santa Fe Institute workshop on immune systems. One physicist at the meeting had learned a little bit about the immune system and had created a mathematical model to account for it. In his talk, he described his model and stressed its powerful implications. Not only are immune systems like ours useful for dealing with pathogens, he explained, but they are absolutely necessary. In order to survive in environments overrun with pathogens, he predicted, long-lived multicellular organisms such as ourselves must necessarily have immune systems with certain distinctive features. For example, the model suggested that long-lived organisms will need to have cells that detect the presence of viral infection, and other cells that produce a wide range of antibodies, generated randomly and then selected to proliferate should they match the invading pathogen. At first blush, the argument may have seemed reasonable. Plus, there was fancy mathematics behind it! An immunologist in the room seemed unconvinced. It is at this point that someone will often raise their hand to question the assumptions of the mathematical model or ask for clarification of the analysis; extensive technical discussion and often disagreements on the mathematical details follow. The immunologist—with decades of experience designing and conducting experiments, reading and reviewing thousands of papers, and teaching courses on immunology to college students—took a different approach. Instead he asked a question that required no more than a basic education in biology. He raised his hand and asked the speaker: “But what about trees?”\n\n\nOnce we reach our physical peak sometime in our twenties or thirties, our performance for most physical and cognitive tasks begins to decline. Biologists call this process senescence.\n\n\nA null model helps us understand what we would observe in a very simple system where not much is going on. In this case we can use a computer simulation to create a pretend world where age doesn’t affect running speed.\n\n\nThat is what null models do. The point of a null model is not to accurately model the world, but rather to show that a pattern X, which has been interpreted as evidence of a process Y, could actually have arisen without Y occurring at all.\n\n\nThe first rule of arguing on the Internet seems to be “Always double down on your own stupidity,” but we strongly discourage this practice.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/The-Creativity-Code":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Math/The-Creativity-Code","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Math/The Creativity Code.md","title":"The Creativity Code","links":[],"tags":["books","computer-science","brain","ai","mathematics","non-fiction"],"content":"The Creativity Code\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about how creativity is entering a new age where AI and machine learning enhances and sometimes surpass human creativity.

And the simp that I am I of course jumped on. (Okay, I like the author and did not feel like a simp. And worse people have given good book recommendations.)\nWho Should Read It?\nPeople who are interested in AI on a superficial level, and would like to know more. People who like culture and music and art should also take the time to understand and read this book.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI think I did not get that changed by the book, but it made me watch the AlphaGo documentary again. The age of AI is upon us and the ones who know will surpass those who live in ignorance.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWorks of art make rules; rules do not make works of art. Claude Debussy\n\n\nThe chief enemy of creativity is good sense. Pablo Picasso\n\n\nBoden believes that exploration accounts for 97 percent of human creativity.\n\n\nThe second sort of creativity involves combination. Think of how an artist might take two completely different constructs and seek to combine them. Often the rules governing one world will suggest an interesting new framework for the other. The combination is a very powerful tool in the realm of mathematical creativity. The eventual solution of the Poincaré Conjecture, which describes the possible shapes of our universe, was arrived at by applying very different tools to understand flow over surfaces.\n\n\nAs Van Gogh wrote: ‘Great things are not done by impulse but by small things brought together.’\n\n\nThe American Go Association estimates that it would take a number with 300 digits to count the number of games of Go that are legally possible. In chess the computer scientist Claude Shannon estimated that a number with 120 digits (now called the Shannon number) would suffice. These are not small numbers in either case, but they give you a sense of the wide range of possible permutations.\n\n\nShapley was amused by the award: ‘I consider myself a mathematician and the award is for economics,’ he said at the time, clearly surprised by the committee’s decision. ‘I never, never in my life took a course in economics.’ But the mathematics he cooked up has had profound economic and social implications.\n\n\nThis is a powerful reminder that, as our lives are increasingly pushed around by algorithms, it’s important to understand how they work and what they’re doing, because otherwise you may be getting shafted.\n\n\nMachines take me by surprise with great frequency. Alan Turing\n\n\nIt is an extraordinary fact that 90 per cent of the world’s data has been created in the last five years.\n\n\nHumankind now produces in two days the same amount of data it took us from the dawn of civilisation until 2003 to generate.\n\n\n‘For some reason, lots of people have screen-savers of deserts and it picks it up, thinking it is skin colour.’ The contours of the dunes also seem to correspond to shapes the algorithms pick up as curvaceous naked body parts.\n\n\nOn 17 December 2009 four users brought a legal case against Netflix, claiming that the company had violated the video privacy protection act by releasing the data. One of the users said she was a closet lesbian mother and that the data about her movie preferences could have revealed this fact. That you might be able to infer sexual orientation or political leanings from your movie preferences has led to this being called the Brokeback Mountain factor.\n\n\nHow did that machine learn to play the Atari game of Breakout without being told the rules of the game? All it had was knowledge of the pixels on the screen and a score and a paddle that could be moved left or right. The algorithm was programmed to calculate the effect on the score of moving left or right given the current state of the screen. The impact of a move could be several seconds down the line, so you have to calculate the delayed impact. This is quite tricky because it isn’t always clear what causes a certain effect. This is one of the shortcomings of machine learning: it sometimes picks up correlation and believes it to be causation. Animals suffer from the same problem.\n\n\nStones crafted to create a cutting tool began to appear 2. million years ago, but this moment of innovation does not seem to have sparked a great creative surge. The human drive to create art seems to emerge 100, years ago.\n\n\nAs Andy Warhol declared: ‘If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface: of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There’s nothing behind it.’\n\n\nInteresting questions of copyright ownership have been raised when animals have been given tools to create. David Slater, who left a camera in the Tangkoko nature reserve in Indonesia to see if he could get the resident macaques to take photographs, was overjoyed when he developed the film to discover that the macaques had taken the most extraordinary selfies. When the pictures found their way on to the internet, he decided to sue the users for breach of copyright. It took a while for his case to wend its way to trial, but in August 2014 the US courts surprised him by denying him ownership of the pictures on the grounds that an item created by a non-human cannot be copyrighted. Things got more bizarre the following year, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, filed a counter-suit against Slater for breaching the macaque’s copyright. This case was thrown out of court.\n\n\nCreativity is about conscious or subconscious choices, not random behaviour. Yet the constraints he had introduced, combined with randomness, had led to the creation of something that has enough tension to hold the eye.\n\n\nModern physics asserts that the only truly random thing happens at a quantum level. It is on the level of subatomic particles that there is some element of choice in the future evolution of the universe.\n\n\nPollock’s approach may appear mechanical, but he threw himself into every one of his paintings. ‘It doesn’t matter how the paint is put on,’ he wrote in describing his method, ‘as long as something is said. Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.’\n\n\nIt seems that when you smooth out the asymmetries, you end up with something quite attractive.\n\n\nThe AI painting totally failed to elicit what Jones calls the Rembrandt Shudder, that feeling one gets in front of every true Rembrandt masterpiece.\n\n\n‘The Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense.’\n\n\nThis is captured in something called the Wundt curve. If we are too habituated to the artwork around us, it leads to indifference and boredom. This is why artists never really stabilise in their work: what arouses the artist (and eventually the viewer) is something distinct. The challenge is that the push to arousal or dissonance must not be so great that we hit the downslope of the Wundt\n\n\nthe not too new, Elgammal steeped himself in the ideas of the psychologist and philosopher D. E. Berlyne, who argued that the psychophysical concept of ‘arousal’ was especially relevant to the study of aesthetic phenomena. Berlyne believed the most significant arousal-raising properties of aesthetics were novelty, unexpectedness, complexity, ambiguity, and the ability to puzzle or confound. The trick was to be new and surprising without drifting so far from expectation that arousal turned to aversion because the result was just too strange. This\n\n\nThis is captured in something called the Wundt curve. If we are too habituated to the artwork around us, it leads to indifference and boredom. This is why artists never really stabilise in their work: what arouses the artist (and eventually the viewer) is something distinct. The challenge is that the push to arousal or dissonance must not be so great that we hit the downslope of the Wundt curve. There is a maximum hedonic value that the artist is after.\n\n\nSudden illumination is a manifest sign of long, unconscious prior work. Henri Poincaré\n\n\nMathematics is the science of spotting and explaining patterns.\n\n\nIt’s this ability to spot a pattern that gives humans an edge in negotiating the natural world, because it allows us to plan into the future. Humans have become very adept at spotting these patterns, because those who missed the pattern didn’t survive.\n\n\nWhen people I meet declare (as alas so often happens): ‘I don’t have a brain for maths’, I counter that in fact we all have evolved to have mathematical brains because our brains are good at spotting patterns\n\n\nDavid Hilbert lectured on geometry he stressed this point: ‘One must be able to say at all times – instead of points, lines and planes – tables, chairs and beer mugs.’ His point was that provided the things had the relationship expressed by the axioms, then the deductions would make as much sense for chairs and beer mugs as for geometric lines and planes.\n\n\nOur writing tools participate in the writing of our thoughts. Friedrich Nietzsche\n\n\nTake the Classification of Finite Simple Groups, a theorem close to my own research. This is a sort of periodic table of the symmetrical atoms from which all symmetrical objects can be built. It is called the ‘Monster Theorem’ because the proof is 10, pages long and spans 100 journal articles and involved hundreds of mathematicians. The list of atoms includes twenty-six strange exceptional shapes called sporadic simple groups. There’s always been a sneaking suspicion that a twenty-seventh might be out there that the proof may have missed. Could a computer help us check such a complex proof?\n\n\nAs Hume first pointed out, much of science relies on a process called induction: inferring a general law or principle from the observation of particular instances. Why is this a sound way of generating scientific truths? Principally because of induction! We can point to many cases where this inductive principle seems to lead to good scientific theories. This leads us to conclude (or induce) that induction is a good approach to doing science.\n\n\n‘Every fool can ask questions about prime numbers that the wisest man cannot answer\n\n\nKurt Gödel, the Austrian logician, has proven that mathematics has true statements for which there are no proofs.\n\n\nWe are very good at figuring out things that computers can’t do. If we were to imagine a future in which all the theorems we currently know about could be proven on a computer, we would just figure out other things that a computer can’t solve, and that would become ‘mathematics’.\n\n\nAs the famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdös quipped: ‘A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.’\n\n\nAfter all, as Bach’s student Lorenz Mizler von Kolof once said: ‘Music is just the process of sounding mathematics.’\n\n\nA similar hack occurred when the official title for the Russian Federation was translated into Ukrainian as Mordor (the land occupied by The Lord of the Rings’ evil Sauron).\n\n\nAs Franz Kafka said: ‘All language is but a poor translation.’\n\n\nThis was certainly a motivation for George Orwell: ‘When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, “I am going to produce a work of art.” I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.’\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Humanocracy":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Humanocracy","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Humanocracy.md","title":"Humanocracy","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","bureaucracy"],"content":"Humanocracy\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\n🎨 Impressions\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\nBureaucracy is like Pornography, it’s hard to find anyone than won’t pretend to be offended by it but there’s a lot of it around.”\nBureaucracy is familiar, complex and systemic, well-defended, serves a purpose and is self-replicating.\nBureaucracy: from the French bureaucratie, the rule of desks.

This is an interesting observation.\nIn business, money is the only moral pillar.\nThe jokes are a way of enlightening hypocrisy.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nCorporate leaders often tell their charges that hard work will lead to success. Indeed, this theory of reward being commensurate with effort has been an enduring belief and a moral imperative in our society, one central to our self-image as a people, where the main chance is available to anyone of ability who has the gumption and persistence to seize it.\n\n\nSuggest in this book that managers’ rules for survival and success are at the heart of what might be called the bureaucratic ethic, a moral code that guides managers through all the dilemmas and vicissitudes that confront them in the big organization.\n\n\nThis book, then, examines business as a social and moral terrain. I offer no programs for reform, should one think that reform is necessary. Nor, I am afraid, do I offer tips on how to find one’s way onto the “fast track” to managerial success. This is, rather, an interpretive sociological account of how managers think the world works.\n\n\nThe term Protestant ethic refers to the set of beliefs and, more particularly, to the set of binding social rules that counseled “secular asceticism”—the methodical, rational subjection of human impulse and desire to God’s will through “restless, continuous, systematic work in a worldly calling.”\n\n\nAffluence and the emergence of the consumer society were responsible, however, for the demise of only some aspects of the old ethic—namely, the imperatives for saving and investment.\n\n\nNo major occupation or profession in our society has escaped the process of bureaucratization. They are all—from assembly-line workers to physicians—specialized, standardized, certified, arranged in a hierarchy, and coordinated by higher authorities.\n\n\nMoreover, bureaucracy is never simply a technical system of organization. It is also always a system of power, privilege, and domination. The bureaucratization of the occupational structure therefore profoundly affects the whole class and status structure, the whole tone and tempo of our society. The changes in our social landscape brought about by this bureaucratization can hardly be exaggerated.\n\n\nIn its pure form, bureaucracy is characterized by a kind of legalistic objectivity, by close attention to details and to orders, by an adherence to standardized procedures, by thorough written documentation of daily business in well-maintained files, by impartial and fair treatment under law, by a consequent impersonality, and by a separation of offices from persons.\n\n\nPatrimonial bureaucracy was the organizational form of the courts of kings and princes. There, personal loyalty was the norm, not loyalty to an office. In a patrimonial bureaucracy, one survives and flourishes by currying favor with powerful officials up the line who stand close to the ruler. It is a system marked by patronage and by intrigues and conspiracies among various factions to gain the favor of the ruler and the perquisites that accompany his good grace.\n\n\nEssentially, managers try to gauge whether they feel “comfortable” with proposed resolutions to specific problems, a task that always involves an assessment of others’ organizational morality and a reckoning of the practical organizational and market exigencies at hand.\n\n\nThere is, for instance, a tremendous competition for ideas in the corporate world; authority provides a license to steal ideas, even in front of those who originated them. Chairmen routinely appropriate the useful suggestions made by members of their committees or task forces; research directors build their reputations for scientific wizardry on the bricks laid down by junior researchers and directors of departments.\n\n\nAs it happens, the CEO is devoted to sailboats and prefers that his aides call him “Skipper.”\n\n\nAs Karl Mannheim, among others, has pointed out, it is precisely when a social order begins to fall apart that one can discern what has held it together in the first place.\n\n\nThe first action of most new CEOs is some form of organizational change. On the one hand, this prevents the inheritance of blame for past mistakes; on the other, it projects an image of bare-knuckled aggressiveness much appreciated on Wall Street.\n\n\nPerhaps most important, a shake-up rearranges the fealty structure of the corporation, placing in power those barons whose style and public image mesh closely with that of the new CEO and whose principal loyalties belong to him.\n\n\nThe saying is: “No one ever comes back from special assignment”);\n\n\nHundreds of people throughout the whole corporation lost their jobs in what became known as “Bloody Thursday,” the “October Revolution,” or in some circles, the “Octoberfest.” I shall refer back to this event as the “big purge.”\n\n\nFealty is the mortar of the corporate hierarchy, but the removal of one well-placed stone loosens the mortar throughout the pyramid.\n\n\nManagers often note that one must stay at least three drinks behind one’s boss at social functions; this meant that Brown’s subordinates might never drink at all on such occasions.\n\n\nHave I ever told you my definition of an auditor? An auditor is someone who situates himself up on a hill overlooking a battle, far from the noise of the guns and the smoke of the explosions. And he watches the battle from afar, and when it is over and the smoke is cleared, he goes down onto the battlefield and walks among the wounded. And he shoots them.\n\n\nBy the time the courts get to cases generated by contemporary practices, typically in fifteen years, those executives presently in charge will have moved on, leaving any problems their policies might create to others.\n\n\nFootsteps behind them.” Bitter jokes circulated freely, like: “Opening Day at the chemical company; Brown comes in and throws out the first employee.”\n\n\n“Every big organization is set up for the benefit of those who control it; the boss gets what he wants.”\n\n\nThe most damaging failure is, as one middle manager in Alchemy Inc. puts it, “When your boss or someone who has the power to determine your fate says: ‘You failed.’”\n\n\nMany managers also note with irony that they work hardest, that is, put in the most hours, when economic times are bad, when even they see few practical results for their efforts. They do not do so because they actually expect their hours of work to produce an economic boom; rather, they know that, unless they are seen toiling with other managers, they might not be around when the good times start to roll.\n\n\nA managerial commonplace says: “In the corporate world, 1,000 ‘Attaboys’ are wiped away with one ‘Oh, shit!’”\n\n\nThe total bill, including lawsuits and now federally mandated repairs to the battery, exceeded 100 million. I have heard figures as high as 150 million, but because of “creative accounting,” no one is sure of the exact amount.\n\n\nAmerican managers seem regularly to look to the short term rather than the long run. There are several reasons for this. First, in the last few decades, there has been an ascendancy of professional managers in the corporate world whose habit of mind, honed by MBA programs, scores of managerial seminars, and a voluminous and ever-growing literature, stresses the quick turnaround of ailing businesses, deal-making both to unload businesses slow to respond to such ministrations and to acquire “winners,” and, of course, the concomitant rapid prospering of one’s own career.\n\n\nA second reason for managers’ short-term perspective is the structure and pace of managerial work itself. Managers’ days are punctuated by quick huddles and endless meetings; the reading and dictation of terse one-page memoranda, devoid of nuance; the scanning of fluctuating market reports; “brain-storming” sessions to surface bright ideas; listening to the presentations of line subordinates about output, productivity, or marketing, or those of staff about suggested guidelines for corporate policies; talking to lawyers about the impact of existing or projected regulation; evaluating the work of subordinates; buttonholing or being buttonholed by other managers for a word of advice or warning or simply to pass the time of day; and finally, constant phone calls.\n\n\nThe old saw, still heard frequently today, “I know what you did for me yesterday, but what have you done for me lately?” is more than a tired garment district salesman’s joke.\n\n\nAs one manager says: “Our horizon is today’s lunch.”\n\n\nDecisions are made only when they are inevitable. To make a decision ahead of the time it has to be made risks political catastrophe. People can always interpret the decision as an unwise one even if it seems to be correct on other grounds.\n\n\nSomewhere, there is a cartoon of President Richard Nixon saying: “I accept all of the responsibility, but none of the blame.”\n\n\nAs one executive says: “When things really go peanut butter, all the goddamn memos in the world are not going to help you.”\n\n\nHowever, when real disaster strikes, the idea that paper protects anyone, at the middle levels in particular, is a vain and naive hope.\n\n\nIn fact, one way of looking at success patterns in the corporation is that the people who are in high positions have never been in one place long enough for their problems to catch up with them. They outrun their mistakes. That’s why to be successful in a business organization, you have to move quickly.\n\n\nThe ideal situation, of course, is to end up in a position where one can fire one’s successors for one’s own previous mistakes.\n\n\n[Milking] works well if [a guy] gets out in time. If a guy keeps moving, he can say, “Look, I ran this plant better than my predecessors.”\n\n\nThese are usually stated briefly as a series of admonitions. (1) You never go around your boss. (2) You tell your boss what he wants to hear, even when your boss claims that he wants dissenting views. (3) If your boss wants something dropped, you drop it. (4) You are sensitive to your boss’s wishes so that you anticipate what he wants; you don’t force him, in other words, to act as boss. (5) Your job is not to report something that your boss does not want reported, but rather to cover it up. You do what your job requires, and you keep your mouth shut.\n\n\nKarl Mannheim points out that bureaucracy turns all political issues into matters of administration\n\n\nBureaucracy transforms all moral issues into immediately practical concerns. A moral judgment based on a professional ethic makes little sense in a world where the etiquette of authority relationships and the necessity for protecting and covering for one’s boss, one’s network, and oneself supercede all other considerations and where nonaccountability for action is the norm.\n\n\nAfter all, as one executive says, “We lie all the time, but if everyone knows that we’re lying, is a lie really a lie?”\n\n\nThe old proverb “Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good,”\n\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board in the Federal Aviation Agency Accident Investigation Records names an airplane crash as a “controlled flight into terrain.”\n\n\nManagement consulting is also rooted in the application of social science to help managers establish control of the workplace. This process has included, to name only a few examples, the extensive and haphazard use of psychological tests to ascertain worker characteristics in both blue- and white-collar workplaces,\n\n\nThe rules seem to be: (1) suppress all irony, ambiguity, and complexity and assert only the most obvious and literal meanings of any phenomenon; (2) ignore all theoretical issues unless they can be encapsulated into a neat schematic form easily remembered, “operationalized,” and preferably diagrammed; (3) always stress the bright side of things, inflating, say, all efforts for change, whether major or minor, into “revolutionary” action; downplay the gloomy, troublesome, crass, or seamy aspects of big organizational life or, better, show managers how to exploit them to their own advantage; (4) provide a step-by-step program tied, of course, to one’s own path-breaking research, that promises to unlock the secrets of organizations; and (5) end with a vision of the future that makes one’s book, program, or consulting services indispensable.\n\n\nThey refer to consultants as “whores in pinstripe suits.”\n\n\nConsumer activists, the far too many Ralph Naders of this world, want to save the universe but not give up their own creature comforts.\n\n\nAnd members of the news media, who link together all of these groups clamoring for air time because of the media’s own vested interest in catastrophe, are cynical rabble-rousers propagating sensational antibusiness stories to sell papers or advertising time on shows like 60 Minutes, which lay in wait to edit for their own purposes clips of the “poor schnooks” stupid enough to submit to their inquisitions.\n\n\nAnother executive muses: “I often ask myself: ‘What is the going price for my soul today?’”\n\n\nThe Protestant ethic was a social construction of reality of a self-confident and independent propertied social class. It was an ideology that extolled the virtues of accumulating and reinvesting wealth in a society organized around property and that accepted the stewardship responsibilities entailed by property.\n\n\nAnd outside consultants are men and women who borrow one’s watch and then charge for telling the time.\n\n\nIn short, bureaucracy creates for managers a Calvinist world without a Calvinist God, a world marked with the same profound anxiety that characterized the old Protestant ethic but one stripped of that ideology’s comforting illusions.\n\n\nManagers often feel that, however genuine it may be, altruism is a motive that is always denied them by others.\n\n\nThe CEO at Weft Corporation, it is said, “doesn’t know a loom from a car.”\n\n\nAnd the higher one goes, the more managers find that “the essence of managerial work is cronyism, covering your ass, [and] pyramiding to protect your buddies.”\n\n\nEventually, Enron became the middleman in trading one-quarter of the nation’s energy. This concentrated control enabled Enron to repeatedly game the markets in oil, gas, and electricity. The rolling electricity blackouts that created havoc for hundreds of thousands of Californians in 2000–2001 were due in part to Enron’s manipulation of energy prices.\n\n\nAll bureaucracies require varying degrees of self-rationalization of their members. Wise and ambitious men and women ruthlessly tailor their public faces—that is, their personal appearances, their vocabularies, and their expressed worldviews—to suit the fashions of the moment.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Seeing-Like-a-State":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Seeing-Like-a-State","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Seeing Like a State.md","title":"Seeing Like a State","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","system-thinking","nationalism","high-modernism","anarchism","architecture","leninsim","communism","holomodor"],"content":"Seeing Like a State\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an investigation into the world of high modernism and an analysis of the consequences of high modernism.\nThe main point of the book is the concept of legibility, as the state, represented as a system of administrators and managers, need to exert control over its population and its system.\nThis is very much exemplified by the concept of forestry and the Prussian method of chopping down diverse forests for monoculture.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was an interesting book. I think the concept of legibility is very important to understand, and this is one of the things that is quite interesting to expand discussions around. How does this legibility affect the world we live in?\nI think the legibility concept, combined with a lack of understanding of entropy, is a very bad and catastrophic way of organizing society.\nIt is also important to understand that informal processes and practical knowledge are quite important forces in society today, and we need to work more to create opportunities for these forces to thrive instead of suppressing them.\nThis is actually a book that is super highly relevant in hindsight. It is a book that is recommended again and again and again.  It is a book that you wish other people had read cause it would make discussions a lot more interesting.  This means it is a must-read in the context of sociology.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nI shall argue that the most tragic episodes of state-initiated social engineering originate in a pernicious combination of four elements. All four are necessary for a full-fledged disaster. The first element is the administrative ordering of nature and society-the transformative state simplifications described above.\n\n\nThe second element is what I call a high-modernist ideology. It is best conceived as a strong, one might even say muscle-bound, version of the self-confidence about scientific and technical progress, the expansion of production, the growing satisfaction of human needs, the mastery of nature\n\n\nThe third element is an authoritarian state that is willing and able to use the full weight of its coercive power to bring these high-modernist designs into being.\n\n\nA fourth element is closely linked to the third: a prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans.\n\n\nThroughout the book I make the case for the indispensable role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of unpredictability\n\n\nThe term metis, which descends from classical Greek and denotes the knowledge that can come only from practical experience, serves as a useful portmanteau word for what I have in mind.\n\n\nThe metaphorical value of this brief account of scientific production forestry is that it illustrates the dangers of dismembering an exceptionally complex and poorly understood set of relations and processes in order to isolate a single element of instrumental value. The instrument, the knife, that carved out the new, rudimentary forest was the razorsharp interest in the production of a single commodity. Everything that interfered with the efficient production of the key commodity was implacably eliminated. Everything that seemed unrelated to efficient production was ignored. Having come to see the forest as a commodity, scientific forestry set about refashioning it as a commodity machine.\n\n\nMonocultures are, as a rule, more fragile and hence more vulnerable to the stress of disease and weather than polycultures are.\n\n\nA good part of the politics of measurement sprang from what a contemporary economist might call the “stickiness” of feudal rents. Noble and clerical claimants often found it difficult to increase feudal dues directly; the levels set for various charges were the result of long struggle, and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a threatening breach of tradition. Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end. The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets.\n\n\nKula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.\n\n\nSome arrangements called for the grain to be heaped, some for a “halfheap,” and still others for it to be leveled or “striked” (ras). These were not trivial matters. A feudal lord could increase his rents by 25 percent by insisting on receiving wheat and rye in heaped bushels.\n\n\nThree factors, in the end, conspired to make what Kula calls the “metrical revolution” possible. First, the growth of market exchange encouraged uniformity in measures. Second, both popular sentiment and Enlightenment philosophy favored a single standard throughout France. Finally, the Revolution and especially Napoleonic state building actually enforced the metric system in France and the empire.\n\n\nThe capital has its order, the village its customs). -Javanese proverb\n\n\nThe Norwegian large farm (gard) posed similar problems. Each household held rights to a given proportion of the value (skyld) of the farm, not to the plot of land; none of the joint owners could call a specific part of the farm his own.\n\n\nSurveyors, one recent Swedish study found, made the fields more geometrically regular than they in fact were. Ignoring small jogs and squiggles made their job easier and did not materially affect the outcome.\n\n\nThis initiative may well have been the origin of the term “laobaixing,” meaning, literally, “the old one hundred surnames,” which in modern China has come to mean “the common people.”\n\n\nA great many northern European surnames, though now permanent, still bear, like a fly caught in amber, particles that echo their antique purpose of designating who a man’s father was ( Fitz-, 0’-, -sen, -son, -s, Mac-, -vich).\n\n\nImagine the dilemma of a tithe or capitation-tax collector faced with a male population, 90 percent of whom bore just six Christian names (John, William, Thomas, Robert, Richard, and Henry).\n\n\n“There can be no clearer expression of imperialist sentiment, a white man’s burden of Francophony, whose first conquests were to be right at home.”\n\n\nOfficials of the modern state are, of necessity, at least one step-and often several steps-removed from the society they are charged with governing. They assess the life of their society by a series of typifications that are always some distance from the full reality these abstractions are meant to capture. Thus the foresters’ charts and tables, despite their synoptic power to distill many individual facts into a larger pattern, do not quite capture (nor are they meant to) the real forest in its full diversity\n\n\nThere is, as Theodore Porter notes in his study of mechanical objectivity, a “strong incentive to prefer precise and standardizable measures to highly accurate ones,” since accuracy is meaningless if the identical procedure cannot reliably be performed elsewhere.\n\n\nThe modern state, through its officials, attempts with varying success to create a terrain and a population with precisely those standardized characteristics that will be easiest to monitor, count, assess, and manage.\n\n\nCategories that organize people’s daily experience precisely because\n\n\nThe aspiration to such uniformity and order alerts us to the fact that modern statecraft is largely a project of internal colonization, often glossed, as it is in imperial rhetoric, as a “civilizing mission.” The builders of the modern nation-state do not merely describe, observe, and map; they strive to shape a people and landscape that will fit their techniques of observation.\n\n\nLiterature on administrative coordination, concludes, “central coordinating schemes do work effectively under conditions where the task environment is known and unchanging, where it can be treated as a closed system.&quot;&quot; The more static, standardized, and uniform a population or social space is, the more legible it is, and the more amenable it is to the techniques of state officials.\n\n\nState officials can often make their categories stick and impose their simplifications, because the state, of all institutions, is best equipped to insist on treating people according to its schemata. Thus categories that may have begun as the artificial inventions of cadastral surveyors, census takers, judges, or police officers can end by becoming categories that organize people’s daily experience precisely because they are embedded in state-created institutions that structure that exper- ience.\n\n\nBelieve that many of the most tragic episodes of state development in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries originate in a particularly pernicious combination of three elements. The first is the aspiration to the administrative ordering of nature and society, an aspiration that we have already seen at work in scientific forestry, but one raised to a far more comprehensive and ambitious level. “High modernism” seems an appropriate term for this aspiration.’\n\n\nIf one were to imagine a pantheon or Hall of Fame of highmodernist figures, it would almost certainly include such names as Henri Comte de Saint-Simon, Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, Robert McNamara, Robert Moses, Jean Monnet, the Shah of Iran, David Lilienthal, Vladimir I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Nyerere.4 They envisioned a sweeping, rational engineering of all aspects of social life in order to improve the human condition.\n\n\nBut here it is important to note that many of the great state-sponsored calamities of the twentieth century have been the work of rulers with grandiose and utopian plans for their society. One can identify a highmodernist utopianism of the right, of which Nazism is surely the diagnostic example.’ The massive social engineering under apartheid in South Africa, the modernization plans of the Shah of Iran, villagization in Vietnam, and huge late-colonial development schemes (for example, the Gezira scheme in the Sudan) could be considered under this rubric.’\n\n\nAs Oscar Wilde remarked, “A map of the world which does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.”\n\n\nHigh modernism is thus a particularly sweeping vision of how the benefits of technical and scientific progress might be applied-usually through the state-in every field of human activity.”\n\n\nThe troubling features of high modernism derive, for the most part, from its claim to speak about the improvement of the human condition with the authority of scientific knowledge and its tendency to disallow other competing sources of judgment.\n\n\nStrong versions of high modernism, such as those heed by Lenin and Le Corbusier, cultivated an Olympian ruthlessness toward the subjects of their interventions. At its most radical, high modernism imagined wiping the slate utterly clean and beginning from zero.\n\n\nThe point of liberal political economy was not only that a free market protected property and created wealth but also that the economy was far too complex for it ever to be managed in detail by a hierarchical administration.’\n\n\nSuch institutions have thwarted the most draconian features of high-modernist schemes in roughly the same way that publicity and mobilized opposition in open societies, as Amartya Sen has argued, have prevented famines. Rulers, he notes, do not go hungry, and they are unlikely to learn about and respond readily to curb famine unless their institutional position provides strong incentives. The freedoms of speech, of assembly, and of the press ensure that widespread hunger will be publicized, while the freedoms of assembly and elections in representative institutions ensure that it is in the interest of elected officials’ self-preservation to prevent famine when they can.\n\n\nWhile astoundingly high construction costs may explain why none of these projects was ever adopted, Le Corbusier’s refusal to make any appeal to local pride in an existing city cannot have helped his case.\n\n\nLe Corbusier had no patience for the physical environment that centuries of urban living had created. He heaped scorn on the tangle, darkness, and disorder, the crowded and pestilential conditions, of Paris and other European cities at the turn of the century. Part of his scorn was, as we shall see, on functional and scientific grounds; a city that was to become efficient and healthful would indeed have had to demolish much of what it had inherited. But another source of his scorn was aesthetic. He was visually offended by disarray and confusion.\n\n\nThe despot is not a man. It is the Plan. The correct, realistic, exact plan, the one that will provide your solution once the problem has been posited clearly, in its entirety, in its indispensable harmony. This plan has been drawn up well away from the frenzy in the mayor’s office or the town hall, from the cries of the electorate or the laments of society’s victims.  - This was a profound statement.\n\n\nThe plaza is best seen, as are many of Le Corbusier’s plans, from the air\n\n\nIn the end, by 1980, 75 percent of the population of Brasilia lived in settlements that had never been anticipated, while the planned city had reached less than half of its projected population of 557,000. The foothold the poor gained in Brasilia was not just a result of the beneficence of Kubitschek and his wife, Dona Sara. Political structure played a key role as well. Squatters were able to mobilize, protest, and be heard by virtue of a reasonably competitive political system.\n\n\nIt was this failure of the general urban planning models that so preoccupied Jacobs. The planners’ conception of a city accorded neither with the actual economic and social functions of an urban area nor with the (not unrelated) individual needs of its inhabitants. Their most fundamental error was their entirely aesthetic view of order. This error drove them to the further error of rigidly segregating functions. In their eyes, mixed uses of real estate-say, stores intermingled with apartments, small workshops, restaurants, and public buildings-created a kind of visual disorder and confusion. The great advantage of one single-use-one shopping area and one residential area was that it made possible the monofunctional uniformity and visual regimentation that they sought.\n\n\nThey treated systems of complex order as if they could be simplified by numerical techniques, regarding shopping, for example, as a purely mathematical issue involving square footage for shopping space and traffic management as an issue of moving a certain number of vehicles in a given time along a certain number of streets of a given width.\n\n\nAn urban space where the police are the sole agents of order is a very dangerous place.\n\n\nThe matter of transportation becomes, for Le Corbusier and others, the single problem of how to transport people (usually in automobiles) as quickly and economically as possible. The activity of shopping becomes a question of providing adequate floor space and access for a certain quantity of shoppers and goods. Even the category of entertainment was split up into specified activities and segregated into playgrounds, athletic fields, theaters, and so on.\n\n\nOne modern solution to the forester’s dilemma was to borrow a management technique called optimum control theory, whereby the sustained timber yield could be successfully predicted by few observations and a parsimonious formula. It goes without saying that optimum control theory was simplest where more variables could be turned into constants. Thus a singlespecies, same-age forest planted in straight lines on a flat plain with consistent soil and moisture profiles yielded simpler and more accu rate optimum control formulas\n\n\nCompared to uniformity, diversity is always more difficult to design, build, and control.\n\n\n“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.”  Also a very, very good statement.\n\n\nWe know enough by now to be exceptionally skeptical about forecasting from current trends in fertility rates, urban migration, or the structure of employment and income. Such predictions have often been wildly wrong.\n\n\nCommunism was modernity’s most devout, vigorous and gallant champion… It was under communist … auspices that the audacious dream of modernity, freed from obstacles by the merciless and omnipotent state, was pushed to its radical limits: grand designs, unlimited social engineering, huge and bulky technology, total transformation of nature. -Zygmunt Bauman, “Living Without an Alternative\n\n\nLenin, if we judge him from his major writings, was a convinced high modernist. The broad lines of his thought were quite consistent; whether he was writing about revolution, industrial planning, agricultural organization, or administration, he focused on a unitary scientific answer that was known to a trained intelligentsia and that ought to be followed.\n\n\nJust as Le Corbusier imagines that the public will acquiesce to the knowledge and calculations of the master architect, so Lenin is confident that a sensible worker will want to place himself under the authority of professional revolutionists.\n\n\nLike its successor, the radio, the newspaper is a medium better suited to sending messages than to receiving them.\n\n\nAs Hannah Arendt succinctly put it, “The Bolsheviks found power lying in the street, and picked it up”\n\n\nIn a chillingly Orwellian passage-a warning, perhaps, to anarchist or lumpen elements who might resist its logic-Lenin indicates how remorseless the system will be: “Escape from this national accounting will inevitably become increasingly difficult … and will probably be accompanied by such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are men of practical life, not sentimental intellectuals and they will scarcely allow anyone to trifle with them), that very soon the necessity of observing the simple, fundamental rules of social life in common will have become a habit.”\n\n\nMarx, who frequently used it as a way of saying that the handloom gives you feudalism and the power loom gives you capitalism.\n\n\nBy placing power within reach of an entire people, the state could eliminate what Marx termed the “idiocy of rural life.”\n\n\nMuch of the attraction of electricity for Lenin had to do with its perfection, its mathematical precision. Man’s work and even the work of the steam-driven plow or threshing machine were imperfect; the operation of an electric machine, in contrast, seemed certain, precise, and continuous.\n\n\nThe ultracentrism advocated by Lenin is permeated in its very essence by the sterile spirit of a nightwatchman (Nachtwachtergeist) rather than by a positive and creative spirit. He concentrated mostly on controlling the party, not on fertilizing it, on narrowing it down, not developing it, on regimenting and not unifying it.”\n\n\n“Every independent thought or initiative is treated as a ‘heresy,’ as a violation of party discipline, as an attempt to infringe on the prerogatives of the center, which must ‘foresee’ everything and ‘decree’ everything and anything.” The harm done came not just from the fact that the specialists and bureaucrats were more likely to make bad decisions. The attitude had two other consequences. First, it reflected a “distrust towards the creative abilities of the workers,” which was unworthy of the “professed ideals of our party.” Second, and most important, it smothered the morale and creative spirit of the working class.\n\n\nLegibility is a condition of manipulation. Any substantial state intervention in society vaccinating a population, producing goods, mobilizing labor, taxing people and their property, conducting literacy campaigns, conscripting soldiers, enforcing sanitation standards, catching criminals, start universal schooling requires the invention of units that are visible.\n\n\nConsider, for a moment, the patterns in such urban settlements as Bruges or the medina of an old Middle Eastern city touched on earlier. Each city, each quarter, each neighborhood is unique; it is the historical vector sum of millions of designs and activities. While its form and function surely have a logic, that logic is not derived from any single, overall plan. Its complexity defies easy mapping. Any map, moreover, would be spatially and temporally limited.\n\n\nIf the state’s goals are minimal, it may not need to know much about the society. Just as a woodsman who takes only an occasional load of firewood from a large forest need have no detailed knowledge of that forest, so a state whose demands are confined to grabbing a few carts of grain and the odd conscript may not require a very accurate or detailed map of the society.\n\n\nIf, however, the state is ambitious-if it wants to extract as much grain and manpower as it can, short of provoking a famine or a rebellion, if it wants to create a literate, skilled, and healthy population, if it wants everyone to speak the same language or worship the same god-then it will have to become both far more knowledgeable and far more intrusive.\n\n\nThe economics of movement, other things being equal, tend to produce recurring geographical patterns of market location, crop specialization, and administrative structure.4\n\n\nIn certain vital respects, Soviet high modernism is not a sharp break from Russian absolutism. Ernest Gellner has argued that of the two facets of the Enlightenment-the one asserting the sovereignty of the individual and his interests, the other commending the rational authority of experts-it was the second that spoke to rulers who wanted their “backward” states to catch up.\n\n\nNearly everything they planned was on a monumental scale, from cities and individual buildings (the Palace of Soviets) to construction projects (the White Sea Canal) and, later, the great industrial projects of the first Five Year Plan (Magnitogorsk), not to mention collectivization. Sheila Fitzpatrick has appropriately called this passion for sheer size “giganto- mania.”\n\n\nNew “revolutionary” funeral and marriage ceremonies were invented amidst much fanfare, and a ritual of “Octobering” was encouraged as an alternative to baptism\n\n\nThe “new man”-the Bolshevik specialist, engineer, or functionarycame to represent a new code of social ethics, which was sometimes simply called kultura. In keeping with the cult of technology and science, kultura emphasized punctuality, cleanliness, businesslike directness, polite modesty, and good, but never showy, manners.’\n\n\nRussians tended to be envious of the level of capitalization, particularly in mechanization, of American farms while the Americans were envious of the political scope of Soviet planning.\n\n\nProclaiming that farming was about 90 percent engineering and only 10 percent agriculture, Campbell set about standardizing as much of his operation as possible.\n\n\nAlthough the corporation struggled on until Campbell’s death in 1966, it provided no evidence that industrial farms were superior to family farms in efficiency and profitability. The advantages industrial farms did have over smaller producers were of another kind. Their very size gave them an edge in access to credit, political influence (relevant to taxes, support payments, and the avoidance of foreclosure), and marketing muscle.\n\n\nThe great achievement, if one can call it that, of the Soviet state in the agricultural sector was to take a social and economic terrain singularly unfavorable to appropriation and control and to create institutional forms and production units far better adapted to monitoring, managing, appropriating, and controlling from above.\n\n\nThe deaths from the hunger and epidemics of 1921-22 nearly equaled the toll claimed by World War I and the civil war combined.\n\n\nThere had been some hope that a gradually expanding collective sector in the 1920s could provide as much as one-third of the country’s grain needs. Instead, the collectivized sector (both the state farms and the collective farms), which absorbed 10 percent of the labor force, produced a dismal 2.2 percent of gross farm production.\n\n\nScholars who agree on little else are in accord on this point: the overriding purpose of collectivization was to ensure the seizure of grain.\n\n\n“The main purpose of collectivization was to increase state grain procurements and reduce the peasants’ ability to withhold grain from the market. This purpose was obvious to peasants from the start, since the collectivization drive of the winter of 1929-30 was the culmination of more than two years of bitter struggle between the peasants and the state over grain procurements.”\n\n\nSemiotically, we cannot understand this modernist vision of agriculture as an isolated ideological fragment. It is always seen as the negation of the existing rural world. A kolkhoz is meant to replace a mir or village, machines to replace horse-drawn plows and hand labor, proletarian workers to replace peasants, scientific agriculture to replace folk tradition and superstition, education to replace ignorance and malokulturnyi, and abundance to replace bare subsistence.\n\n\nUnderlying the whole plan, of course, was the assumption that the great collective farms would operate like factories in a centralized economy, in this case fulfilling state orders for grain and other agricultural products. As if to drive the point home, the state confiscated roughly 63 percent of the entire harvest in 1931.\n\n\nFrom a central planner’s perspective, one great advantage of collectivization is that the state acquired control over how much of each crop was sown.\n\n\nWe catch a glimpse of the disasters from the Great Purges of 1936-37, when a certain amount of peasant criticism of kolkhoz officials was briefly encouraged in order to detect “wreckers.”\n\n\nFor the kolkhozniki, however, meeting the quota might mean starvation. Indeed, the great famine of 1933-34 can only be called a collectivization and procurement famine. Those who were tempted to make trouble risked running afoul of a more grisly quota: the one for kulaks and enemies of the state.\n\n\nThe peasants began to say that the acronym for the All-Union Communist Party-vKP-stood for vtoroe krepostnoe pravo, or “second serfdom.\n\n\nThe parallel was not a mere figure of speech; the resemblances to serfdom were remarkable. The kolkhoz members were required to work on the state’s land at least half-time for wages, in cash or kind, that were derisory. They depended largely on their own small private plots to grow the food they needed (other than grain), although they had little free time to cultivate their gardens. The quantity to be delivered and price paid for kolkhoz produce was set by the state. The kolkhozniki owed annual corvee labor dues for roadwork and cartage. They were obliged to hand over quotas of milk, meat, eggs, and so on from their private plots. The collective’s officials, like feudal masters, were wont to use kolkhoz labor for their private sidelines and had, in practice if not in law, the arbitrary power to insult, beat, or deport the peasants. As they were under serfdom, they were legally immobilized.\n\n\nWhat must strike even a casual student of collectivization, however, is how it largely failed in each of its highmodernist aims, despite huge investments in machinery, infrastructure, and agronomic research. Its successes, paradoxically, were in the domain of traditional statecraft.\n\n\nThe most legible educational system would resemble Hippolyte Taine’s description of French education in the nineteenth century, when “the Minister of Education could pride himself, just by looking at his watch, which page of Virgil all schoolboys of the Empire were annotating at that exact moment.&quot;&quot;\n\n\nThe ujamaa village campaign in Tanzania from 1973 to 1976 was a massive attempt to permanently settle most of the country’s population in villages, of which the layouts, housing designs, and local economies were planned, partly or wholly, by officials of the central government.\n\n\nHigh-modernist plans tend to “travel” as an abbreviated visual image of efficiency that is less a scientific proposition to be tested than a quasi-religious faith in a visual sign or representation of order.\n\n\nAs Jacobs suggested, they may substitute an apparent visual order for the real thing. The fact that they look right becomes more important than whether they work; or, better put, the assumption is that if the arrangement looks right, it will also, ipso facto, function well.\n\n\nAdministrative convenience, not ecological considerations, governed the selection of sites; they were often far from fuelwood and water, and their population often exceeded the carrying capacity of the land.\n\n\nAuthoritarian social engineering is apt to display the full range of standard bureaucratic pathologies. The transformations it wishes to effect cannot generally be brought about without applying force or without treating nature and human subjects as if they were functions in a few administrative routines.\n\n\nThe failure of ujamaa villages was almost guaranteed by the highmodernist hubris of planners and specialists who believed that they alone knew how to organize a more satisfactory, rational, and productive life for their citizens.\n\n\nIdeas cannot digest reality. -Jean-Paul Sartre\n\n\n“A national language is a dialect with an army.”\n\n\nThe planned city, the planned village, and the planned language (not to mention the command economy) are, we have emphasized, likely to be thin cities, villages, and languages. They are thin in the sense that they cannot reasonably plan for anything more than a few schematic aspects of the inexhaustibly complex activities that characterize “thick” cities and villages.\n\n\nWhen you begin making decisions and cutting it up rules and names appear And once names appear, you should know when to stop. -Tao-to-ching\n\n\n*Cultivation is simplification. Even the most cursory forms of agriculture typically produce a floral landscape that is less diverse than an unmanaged landscape. *\n\n\nThe variety of landraces is significant in another sense. All modern crops of any economic significance are the product of landraces. Until about 1930 all scientific crop breeding was essentially a process of selection from among the existing landraces. Landraces and their wild progenitors and “escapes” represent the “germ plasm” or seed-stock capital upon which modern agriculture is based. In other words, as James Boyce has put it, modern varieties and traditional agriculture are complements, not substitutes.”\n\n\n“Genetic variability,” as Jack Ralph Kloppenberg notes, “is the enemy of mechanization\n\n\n“Machines are not made to harvest crops,” noted two proponents of phytoengiering. “In reality, crops must be designed to be harvested by machine.”\n\n\nThe development of the “supermarket tomato” by G. C. (Jack) Hanna at the University of California at Davis in the late 1940s and 1950s is an early and diagnostic case.16 Spurred by the wartime shortage of field labor, researchers set about inventing a mechanical harvester and breeding the tomato that would accommodate it.\n\n\nCorn accounts for one-third of the total market for herbicides and one-quarter of the market for insecticides\n\n\nNothing better illustrates the myopic credo of high-modernist agriculture, originating in temperate zones and brought to the tropics, than its nearly unshakable faith in the superiority of monoculture over the practice of polyculture found in much of the Third World.\n\n\nThe best fertilizer on any farm is the footsteps of the owner. -Confucius\n\n\n“There is a fundamental presumption in physics that the way you understand the world is that you keep isolating its ingredients until you understand the stuff you think is truly fundamental. Then you presume that the other things you don’t understand are details. The assumption is that there are a small number of principles that you can discern by looking at things in their pure state this is the truly analytic notion-and somehow you put these together in some more complicated ways when you want to solve more dirty problems. If you can\n\n\nOne of the major purposes of state simplifications, collectivization, assembly lines, plantations, and planned communities alike is to strip down reality to the bare bones so that the rules will in fact explain more of the situation and provide a better guide to behavior.\n\n\nBelieve that this uncritical, and hence unscientific, trust in the artifacts and techniques of what became codified as scientific agriculture was responsible for its failures. The logical companion to complete faith in a quasi-industrial model of high modernist agriculture was an often explicit contempt for the practices of actual cultivators and what might be learned from them. Whereas a scientific spirit would have counseled skepticism and dispassionate inquiry into these practices, modern agriculture, as a blind faith, preached scorn and summary dismissal.\n\n\nIn a work-to rule action (the French call it greve du zele), employees begin doing their jobs by meticulously observing every one of the rules and regulations and performing only the duties stated in their job descriptions. The result, fully intended in this case, is that the work grinds to a halt, or at least to a snail’s pace. The workers achieve the practical effect of a walkout while remaining on the job and following their instructions to the letter. Their action also illustrates pointedly how actual work processes depend more heavily on informal understandings and improvisations than upon formal work rules. In the long work-to-rule action against Caterpillar, the large equipment manufacturer, for example, workers reverted to following the inefficient procedures specified by the engineers, knowing they would cost the company valuable time and quality, rather than continuing the more expeditious practices they had long ago devised on the job.’\n\n\nOn a much bigger, higher-stakes canvas, war diplomacy and politics more generally are metis-laden skills. The successful practitioner, in each case, tries to shape the behavior of partners and opponents to his own ends. Unlike the sailor, who can adjust to the wind and the waves but not influence them directly, the general and the politician are in constant interaction with their counterparts, each of whom is trying to outfox the other.\n\n\nWe might reasonably think of situated, local knowledge as being partisan knowledge as opposed to generic knowledge. That is, the holder of such knowledge typically has a passionate interest in a particular outcome. An insurer of commercial shipping for a large, highly capitalized maritime firm can afford to rely on probability distributions for accidents. But for a sailor or captain hoping for a safe voyage, it is the outcome of the single event, a single trip, that matters. Metis is the ability and experience necessary to influence the outcome-to improve the odds-in a particular instance.\n\n\nAccording to Anil Gupta, roughly three-quarters of the modern pharmacopoeia are derivatives of traditionally known medicines.\n\n\nMetis knowledge is often so implicit and automatic that its bearer is at a loss to explain\n\n\nA staple of early medical training, I have been told, is the story of a physician who, at the turn of the century, had a spectacularly high success rate in diagnosing syphilis in its early stages. Laboratory tests confirmed his diagnoses, but he himself did not know precisely what it was that he detected in the physical exams that led him to his conclusions. Intrigued by his success, hospital administrators asked two other doctors to closely observe his examination of patients over several weeks and to see if they could spot what he was picking up. At long last, they and the doctor realized that he was unconsciously registering the patients’ slight eye tremor. The eye tremor then became a universally recognized symptom of syphilis.\n\n\nChinese recipes, it has always amused me, often contain the following instruction: “Heat the oil until it is almost smoking.” The recipes assume that the cook has made enough mistakes to know what oil looks like just before it begins smoking.\n\n\nThis brings us squarely to two of the great ironies of metis. The first is that metis is not democratically distributed. Not only does it depend on a touch or a knack that may not be common, but access to the experience and practice necessary for its acquisition may be restricted. Artisan guilds, gifted craftsmen, certain classes, religious fraternities, entire communities, and men in general often treat some forms of knowledge as a monopoly they are reluctant to share. Better stated, the availability of such knowledge to others depends greatly on the social structure of the society and the advantages that a monopoly in some forms of knowledge can confer.” In this respect metis is not unitary, and we should perhaps speak of metises, recognizing its nonhomo- geneity. The second irony is that, however plastic and receptive metis is, some forms of it seem to depend on key elements of preindustrial life for their elaboration and transmission. Communities that are marginal to markets and to the state are likely to retain a high degree of metis;\n\n\nAs Stephen Marglin’s early work has convincingly shown, capitalist profit requires not only efficiency but the combination of efficiency and control.\n\n\nThey said … that he was so devoted to Pure Science … that he would rather have people die by the right therapy than be cured by the wrong. -Sinclair Lewis, Arrowsmith\n\n\nAs Pascal wrote, the great failure of rationalism is “not its recognition of technical knowledge, but its failure to recognize any other.”\n\n\nYet a man who uses an imaginary map, thinking that it is a true one, is likely to be worse off than someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire whenever he can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search continuously with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of where he should go. -E. F. Schumacher, Small Is Beautiful\n\n\nThe great high-modernist episodes that we have examined qualify as tragedies in at least two respects. First, the visionary intellectuals and planners behind them were guilty of hubris, of forgetting that they were mortals and acting as if they were gods. Second, their actions, far from being cynical grabs for power and wealth, were animated by a genuine desire to improve the human condition-a desire with a fatal flaw.\n\n\nThat these tragedies could be so intimately associated with optimistic views of progress and rational order is in itself a reason for a searching diagnosis.\n\n\nThe mistake of our ancestors was to think that they were “the last number,” but since numbers are infinite, they could not be the last number. -Eugene Zamiatin,\n\n\nThis circular, however, noted that many new, essential elements of proper nutrition had been discovered in the past two decades and that many more elements will presumably be identified by researchers in the decades ahead. Therefore, on the basis of what they did not know, the writers of this piece recommended that one’s diet be as varied as possible, on the prudent assumption that it would contain many of these yet unidentified essentials.\n\n\nStephen Marglin has put their problem succinctly: If “the only certainty about the future is that the future is uncertain, if the only sure thing is that we are in for surprises, then no amount of planning, no amount of prescription, can deal with the contingencies that the future will reveal.“’\n\n\nThe quantitative technologies used to investigate social and economic life work best if the world they aim to describe can be remade in their image. -Theodore M. Porter, Trust in Numbers\n\n\nOne of Le Corbusier’s plans, for example, called for the segregation of factory workers and their families in barracks along the major transportation arteries. It was a theoretically efficient solution to transportation and production problems. If it had been imposed, the result would have been a dispiriting environment of regimented work and residence without any of the animation of town life.\n\n\nEverything is said to be under the leadership of the Party. No one is in charge of the crab or the fish, but they are all alive. -Vietnamese villager, Xuan Huy village\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Survival-of-the-Savvy":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Survival-of-the-Savvy","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Sociology/Bureaucracy/Survival of the Savvy.md","title":"Survival of the Savvy","links":["Systems/Systematics","Communication/Relationships/Crucial-Conversations-Tools-for-Talking-When-Stakes-are-High","Communication/Nonviolent-Communication"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","politics","political-science","sociology","business/politics","business-communications"],"content":"Survival of the Savvy\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about navigating the corporate world of politics and still remaining a high-integrity individual.

See Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes are High and Nonviolent Communication for tips.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nA corporate survival-of-the-fittest situation does exist, especially in tough economic, competitive, and cost-conscious times.\n\n\nOrganizational politics are informal, unofficial, and sometimes behind-the-scenes efforts to sell ideas, influence an organization, increase power, or achieve other targeted objectives.\n\n\nTwo conditions determine whether organizational politics become constructive or destructive: Whether the targeted objectives are for the company’s interest or only self-interests; and Whether the influence efforts used to achieve those objectives have integrity or not.\n\n\nWhen overly political people do whatever works to get into positions of power, they can damage competent, loyal people or pillage organizational performance.\n\n\nEvery time someone is let go, it’s not necessarily because of political dynamics, but often that plays a critical role in the “Why me?” career speed bump.\n\n\nThe oft-quoted words of Lord Philip Chesterfield over two centuries ago are still true: “Learning is acquired by reading books, but the much more necessary learning… is only to be acquired by reading men, and studying all the various editions of them.”\n\n\nThis book pinpoints recognizing political styles as the key for unlocking the door to enhanced organizational impact.\n\n\nPower of Ideas people on the left side of our model are not necessarily apolitical or under political—just less politically driven than their right-side counterparts.\n\n\nPower of Ideas people screen decisions through the question “Do my actions have integrity and are they good for the company?” They place ethics and what’s beneficial for the common good over personal success.\n\n\nThere’s an old European curse, “May you be blessed with a great idea and no one to implement it.”\n\n\n“Any virtue carried to the extreme can become a crime.”\n\n\nAlexandre Dumas wrote in The Count of Monte Cristo, “Any virtue carried to the extreme can become a crime.”\n\n\nPower of Ideas (Less Political) people risk losing out to More Political people because of a “corporate survival of the savvy.”\n\n\nThe further left you are (Under Political) combined with the further right others are (Overly Political), the more you are at a disadvantage when competing for these five areas of political capital: (1) power, (2) credit for results, (3) who receives blame, (4) promotions, and (5) resources.\n\n\nHonesty pushed to an extreme can hurt feelings, bruise egos, or leak information to people who use it against you.\n\n\nLike organizational psychologist Jack Gibb, we define true trust as earned trust: Trust = Risk Successfully Survived.\n\n\nThis behavior is called fundamentalist, but there’s nothing “fun” when someone goes “mental” on you as a “fun-da-mentalist” reactionary.\n\n\nInflated integrity can mean a refusal to compromise, shooting oneself in the foot, like the sales manager we know who refused to let his people take clients or prospects to lunch. The executive ignored a common business courtesy, set up his sales force to look cheap, and blocked business development\n\n\nIn 1887, Lord Acton wrote in a letter, “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”\n\n\nThe word sabotage is storied to be from the French word for wooden shoe, sabot, to recall how French workers threw their shoes into newfangled machinery to foil the efforts of industrial revolution bosses.\n\n\nWe warn any high-level person of “CEO disease,” which is the susceptibility to manipulation by other power trippers who know how to feed the runaway ego of a boss.\n\n\nSelf-Talk is an automatic mental habit, but we can tweak it if it doesn’t serve us well.

If you’re projecting untrue assumptions onto a colleague, you’ll probably treat her in ways that get you into hot water, right?\n\n\nDuring family crises, one of our fathers used to calm the situation by reminding us that “no babies died.” One of our seminar instructors regains her perspective by comparing any job bummer to being in bullet-ridden wartime Bosnia: “Let’s see, we have my lousy performance-appraisal rating here and we have Bosnia over here. Bosnia… appraisal… Bosnia… appraisal.”\n\n\nWe hope we’re in alignment with you regarding four pillars of political awareness. The Need. Our individual-level wake-up call linked politics to career and job success. We made an initial leadership wake-up call linking politics and company success, and we’ll return to this organization-wide perspective later. Balanced Viewpoint . We shifted organizational politics away from the old definition of politics— poly (many)–tics (bloodsucking parasites)—to a value-free concept allowing for ethical means and ends to achieve “impact with integrity.” The Organizational Savvy Continuum . You have a cognitive framework for understanding the beliefs, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses of each political style. Your Reactions . You’re aware of Self-Talk that fuels your helpful or harmful attitudes, emotions, and actions within the political arena.\n\n\nOfficial Position Power. Position power and rank, decision-making status, and lines of command form the skeleton of the power structure. This is clear from company organizational charts, approval chains, and sign-off protocols.\n\n\nIdentify the current top leaders in as many functions as you can across the enterprise. Be aware of the leaders at as many levels as is practical outside of your narrow slice of the company.\n\n\nUnofficial Influence Power. Savvy leaders also read the white spaces on the organizational chart. Besides tuning your antennas to official position power, pick up on the informal influencers and power connections. Who is part of the favored inner circle and who are the outcasts? Do you know who’s wired in, who has the ear of top management, and who really makes the decisions?\n\n\nWhen asked who the boss is between daddy and mommy: “Who is the boss? You have to ask that? I’m the boss. Mommy is only the decision maker.” Title can be just that—a mere title.\n\n\nThe mother calms her daughter’s worries about how the “boss” of that family will respond by reassuring her, “Toula, the man is the head, but the woman is the neck and she can turn the head any way she wants.”\n\n\nMany companies call emerging leaders Hi Po’s, for “high potential” managers, and they are often put on a fast track of special training and grooming. This can even begin early in careers when “golden boys and girls” are plucked out of prestigious universities and put into high-visibility rotation programs for rapid advancement.\n\n\nOnce you know who holds the official, unofficial, and emerging power—your stakeholders—learn what matters to them. You’ll later learn to ethically lobby these people so that they are more likely to endorse your ideas, initiatives, and recommendations\n\n\nSuperstar negotiators gather every piece of information they can about the other party—how she thinks and feels, her passions and fears, current-event topics to avoid, and personal preferences such as favorites in food, music, sports, fashion, or entertainment.\n\n\nOne leading company in its field told us that the written rule is “balanced work and family life,” but that the unwritten rule is to balance between twelve-hour and sixteen-hour workdays.\n\n\nYou’ve heard the phrase “Perception is reality.” We prefer saying, “Perception isn’t reality, but people sure make decisions based on it.”\n\n\nSome Power of Ideas managers equate networking to “kissing up,” or an imposition on people’s time. As politics-avoidant people avoid corporate events, their overly ambitious counterparts are tying together the shoelaces of colleagues to beat them to a table of powerful people.\n\n\nYou can’t change that people form and circulate buzz, but you can change your response. You can become the pilot of your corporate buzz, guiding how word about you travels through the company. Instead of being a victim of a negative reputation permeating the informal airwaves, broadcast your own buzz.\n\n\nIf you want to sell a car, you can’t keep it in the garage. —SHARON GRUNDFAST, SENIOR MANAGER AVON PRODUCTS LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nYou’re not showboating—you’re showcasing. You’re not stealing credit, exaggerating your contributions, or plagiarizing.\n\n\nHistorians report that the fastidious British prisoners in World War II German camps on average did better at surviving the wrath of the Gestapo than POWs whose grooming fell by the wayside, along with their attitudes about the future.\n\n\nYour Friends May Come and Go, but Your Enemies Accumulate\n\n\nInvitation. Correlated more with the left side of the Organizational Savvy Continuum (but appropriately so, not weak), this word choice is more provisional and safer with a defensive Borderline Overly Political or clearly Overly Political person. Since you might threaten her even though you’re being firm, not harsh, play it safe by using phrases like these: what if; would it be possible; one alternative we might explore; I’d appreciate your ideas on a direction; we’re leaning toward this vendor but need your input and guidance.\n\n\nThese invitation-style lead-ins within the firm language range still present your recommendations but in a more ask-oriented manner. You’re not apologizing—just showing respect by inviting the other’s consideration.\n\n\nConviction. Now we edge toward the right side of the Organizational Savvy Continuum yet remain within the firm vocabulary range. Conviction language avoids being harsh (OP), but still conveys strength and self-assurance to generate a power impression. You’re stating your case in a bolder, tell -oriented fashion: I recommend; we strongly suggest; my advice is that we; based on my experience; our point of view is. Many Power of Person seniors respond well when you’re authoritative without being presumptuous. If you don’t cross the line into harsh wording, this more declarative method of packaging your ideas raises seniors’ estimation of you as you earn task-level trust.\n\n\nYou can sabotage your firm influence vocabulary if you forget to accent your words with confident body language and a committed-sounding vocal rate, tone, and volume.\n\n\nOn the other hand, sample conviction-slanted lead-in phrases are “Steve, we agree about the upside of conducting a public forum given the furor. I’m concerned about how local media could seize on the forum to push their editorial views.” “Martha, a challenge we’ll face in training the service reps in listening skills is that call handle time will initially increase while they feel awkward with new skills.” “Louise, if you’re serious about delaying the layoff announcement, an issue we may face is rumors circulating and the potential resentment when we finally break the news.”\n\n\nAvoid the Words But and Problem.\n\n\nBut discounts everything you say before it:\n\n\nI have never been hurt by anything I didn’t say. —CALVIN COOLIDGE\n\n\n*Reinforce Her Contribution . “The system was great when you devised it. We would have been in trouble without it. But something you said to me yesterday got me thinking.” Plant the Seeds for Her to Think of the Idea . “Have you had any time to think about the current configuration of the system installation given the new factors that exist?”\n\n\nStroke Her Ego . “I was wondering if you had time to help me think through some potential enrichments to the system since you’re the resident technology guru.”\n\n\nFace-Saving Lead-ins . Get used to injecting phrases like as you know or you’ve probably already been thinking this, but…\n\n\nRemove Any Inkling of Blame . “There’s no way anyone could have predicted the growth we’ve had since the system conversion, not to mention changes in peripheral technology. But since these variables have entered the picture, I’m wondering…”\n\n\nLink Your Idea to Image . “I’m excited about the visibility and kudos these upgrades will get our function” (aka, “Hey, boss, do you realize how great I can make you look?”).\n\n\nUse We Language. Partnering with the senior lowers her feelings of blame or criticism and helps you gain some visibility and credit if she likes your idea.\n\n\nRemember—You’re Still a Good Person! Just because you understand favors doesn’t make you opportunistic\n\n\nBack to Networking. Build your network with an eye toward gathering a surplus in your political-favors bank account and paving the way for ethical lobbying. The wider the “net” in your network, the more potential “fish” you catch to support your ideas.\n\n\nMaster salespeople ethically reposition their product slightly differently to highlight how it supports various buyers’ unique needs.\n\n\nThe comedian George Carlin understands how it all works: “The environmentalists finally got it right. They figured out that no one wanted to give any money to swamps and jungles. So now they call it ‘wetlands’ and ‘rain forests.’”\n\n\nIt’s like a cruise ship whose turn is a wider arc. So, remember the Serenity Prayer that is widely used in the Alcoholics Anonymous organization: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n\nBelieve in giving the benefit of the doubt. But when the other person gets all the benefit and you get all the doubt, you’re eligible for lifetime membership in the Naïve Club.\n\n\n“Pick Battles Big Enough to Matter, Small Enough to Win.” This quote from Jonathan Kozol counsels carefully weighing the decision whether to play hardball.\n\n\nOne Nazi concentration camp survivor inspired his son by letting go of bitterness, proclaiming that the Nazis took five years of his life and that he refused to give them one second more.\n\n\nMake no mistake—all organizations are political. Just because your company may be less political doesn’t mean your culture is nonpolitical\n\n\nOne CEO in a more openly political organization said, “At least around here, when someone is in the penalty box, you know it.”\n\n\nBarron’s “Executive Excess 2003” study found that the highest-paid CEOs had the most mediocre performance and greatest pay inequity. Among fifty companies with the most layoffs and underfunded pensions, CEOs earned paychecks that surged 44 percent the next year, compared with a median 6 percent pay increase in other organizations.\n\n\nJim Hightower’s Thieves in High Places reports that the twenty-five companies with the highest-paid CEOs, COOs, and CFOs in the years from 1999 to 2003 (with salaries totaling $23 billion) saw their stock plummet 75 percent, prompting Fortune magazine to call the list “the twenty-five companies with the greediest executives.”\n\n\nYou may incredulously ask, “Why do these people think it’s OK to break the rules?” The answer is—because they can! Some people cynically believe that breaking rules is resourceful, enterprising, and creative.\n\n\nDavid Geffen, now worth almost $4 billion through his DreamWorks brainchild, falsely told William Morris Agency he’d graduated UCLA after discovering that a college degree was required for advancement. He then intercepted and destroyed a letter sent by UCLA to set the record straight.\n\n\nSomeone once asked Willie Sutton, the famous bank robber, why he robbed banks. Willie replied, “That’s where the money is.”\n\n\nIf we ask why CEOs are targets of deception, the answer is “That’s where the money is”—in the form of salary, bonuses, options, pensions, and perks.\n\n\nA Wall Street maxim is “Fear and greed move markets.”\n\n\nWe’ve already referenced CEO disease, whereby leaders believe all the compliments they receive, so we have to “cure them” by telling them, “You might not be as smart, funny, or good-looking as others are saying.”\n\n\nThe conceited executive believes he can size up people and situations well, but if he has weeded out the people who speak the truth and is surrounded by people who give him self-serving or filtered information, he may be seriously out of touch with what is really going on inside and outside the company.\n\n\nDecisions about romantic partners, friends, financial partners, salespeople, consultants, and politicians are “bets” we make on other people.\n\n\nGloria Steinem said that more men than women gamble because “women satisfy their entire urge to gamble when they get married.”\n\n\nDo not judge your brothers and sisters, for there are secrets in their hearts that would make you weep. —ANONYMOUS, FROM A WORKSHOP PARTICIPANT\n\n\nEnron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins testified that her internal memo to Chairman Ken Lay nearly got her fired by the CFO.\n\n\nConfucius said, “A man who commits a mistake and doesn’t admit it is committing another mistake.”\n\n\nInstall processes so that informal team feedback occurs regularly. One method is to end team meetings with a “debriefing session.” At this time people share their reactions to the meeting, including feedback to one another about\n\n\nMore than anything, your own willingness to be an exemplar of receiving feedback nondefensively sparks a feedback-rich environment.\n\n\nReinforce the person’s integrity and urge future forthcoming communication: “Jerry, I have to be honest. I’m not thrilled this happened, just as you aren’t. But I really appreciate that you trusted me enough to come and tell me.\n\n\nThe moment of truth has arrived. Does your company’s political climate stand up to the “soccer game test”? Are people comfortable going to their kids’ sporting events while wearing a T-shirt displaying the company name?\n\n\nHe that gives good advice builds with one hand. He that gives good counsel and example builds with both. But he that gives good admonition and bad examples Builds with one hand and pulls down with the other. —FRANCIS BACON\n\n\nPeter Drucker, management guru, captured the responsibility of the individual leader in setting the values vision: “The final proof of the sincerity and seriousness of leadership is uncompromising emphasis on integrity of character.”\n\n\nThose are my principles. If you don’t like them, I have others. —GROUCHO MARX\n\n\nDostoyevsky wrote, “If a man lost his soul overnight, at least he would notice the loss and be desperate to restore.

These three methods are described in detail to show the reader how to deal with bureaucracy.\n🎨 Impressions\nThe Al-Qaeda form application really got me.\nThe Little Britain Computer Says no file. \nI think this was a good book, and a must for all that works within digitalization and digital transformations.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nPsychologists have watched children spend more time arguing over the rules of a game than actually playing\n\n\nThe three-page application to join al-Qa’ida asks applicants to list their hobbies and pastimes, and asks “What objectives would you like to accomplish on your jihad path?”\n\n\nThe Middle Ages saw Roman bureaucracy replaced by the feudal system, which (according to the economist and historian Ludwig Von Mises) was an attempt at governing without a centralized bureaucracy—an effort that failed miserably.\n\n\nAnd it was the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V of Spain who, in modernizing the administration of his empire—yes, modernizing—gave us another useful term when he bound important documents with red tape instead of plain white string.\n\n\nThe term bureaucracy itself—“rule by offices” or “rule by desks”—was meant to be sarcastic when the French gave it to us in the mid-eighteenth century\n\n\nFreedom has to be in tension with something, or it’s just randomness\n\n\nBureaucracy is a way to structure organizational interactions. That’s all.\n\n\nThe distinction I’ve laid out between traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal authority is more or less that of Max Weber\n\n\nImpersonality is crucial to the bureaucratic mindset\n\n\n“All complex organizations,” Wilson says, “display bureaucratic problems of confusion, red tape, and the avoidance of responsibility.”\n\n\nOne reason that businesses demand bureaucracy from the government is the predictability (calculability) it offers. Free markets require transparency and predictability:\n\n\nWhat seems to underlie this type of speech is a denial of agency. Individuals avoid acknowledging their responsibility with the help of vague and confusing language, just as they do by pointing to bureaucratic rules they are obliged to follow.\n\n\nAs Arendt put it, bureaucracy was conveniently a system where “neither one nor the best, neither the few nor the many, can be held responsible, and which could be properly called the rule by Nobody…. Rule by Nobody is clearly the most tyrannical of all, since there is no one left who could even be asked to answer for what is being done.”\n\n\nScrum—please don’t hit me, Agile IT folks—Scrum is a bureaucratic way of performing IT delivery\n\n\nBut—I was told by my best bureaucracy savants—I could sign a Management Instruction, composed by them in fluent Orwellian, as long as it wasn’t a policy, and the people who worked for me would still have to follow it. This was becoming fun.\n\n\nWe have a leadership principle at Amazon that goes like this: Be Right a Lot. That helps when you’re taking risk in a bureaucracy as well: it’s less risky when you do the right things.\n\n\nMy bureaucratic variant on Occam’s Razor says “Don’t add extra work that doesn’t add value” or “Choose the process that is leanest, given an equal amount of value delivered” or, in the case where the value to the business is risk reduction, “Don’t do extra risk-reduction work that doesn’t reduce risk.” It’s a principle of bureaucratic parsimony.\n\n\nPigs and chickens: In Scrum, the project team members are “pigs” and everyone else is a “chicken.” The idea is that team members are fully committed, like pigs who provide bacon, and everyone else is only “involved,” like the chickens that provide eggs. Scrum says chickens should defer to pigs, as in George Orwell’s Animal Farm. Knowing Mr. Schwartz, he is probably also thinking of the fact that the pig-leader in Animal Farm is named Napoleon, one of Mr. Schwartz’s favorite historical figures.\n\n\nFrom another angle, software code itself is a kind of bureaucracy. A rule-maker—called a programmer—writes code to represent rules that will be followed by the computer and the user, constraining the behavior of both.\n\n\nThe backlog, by the way, is a truly ingenious piece of bureaucracy—a last in, nothing out queue that imprisons requests until some inscrutable process grants them a hearing.\n\n\nBut as James C. Scott, a political scientist teaching at Yale, shows in Seeing Like a State, centralization results in a loss of important local details as higher-level abstractions are imposed.\n\n\nCentralized government’s need to “make a society legible, to arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion.”7 But such simplifications lose fidelity; the representation they create “always ignores essential features of any real, functioning social order.”\n\n\nThere are many good reasons why IT departments have inflicted ticketing systems†† on their colleagues, but there’s no denying that they’re a piece of IT bureaucracy that inspires our coworkers with dread and loathing.\n\n\nAccording to von Mises, bureaucracy is necessarily inefficient, since it’s the system that’s used for management when there’s no market value for the services produced. Since nonprofits and government agencies can always spend more trying to deliver better service, their spending must be checked by rules and people who can say no—that is, a bureaucracy.\n\n\nIn “Bureaucracy and New Product Innovation,” James D. Hlavacek argues that because innovation always seems inefficient, it can have no place in a bureaucracy—which, as we know, is designed for efficiency (that idea again! Damn you, Max!).\n\n\nIn fact, bureaucracies are designed for precisely the opposite of innovation—they routinize what the company has done to make it repeatable.\n\n\nGraeber says that “bureaucracy represents an inherent flaw in the democratic project.”19 “In principle,” he says, “all of these stuffy functionaries in their offices, with their elaborate chains of command, should have been mere feudal holdovers.”\n\n\nIn the British TV comedy Little Britain, a bank worker responds to every customer request by entering it into her computer and reporting “Computer says no!”\n\n\nOnce rules become rituals, changing them is tantamount to breaking apart the community. The rigidity with which rules are applied becomes a rigidity in the rules themselves.\n\n\nOther studies indicate that employees don’t mind routinized processes as long as they’re designed well,\n\n\nDivision of accountability is also a core principle of DevOps, in that teams are fully committed and responsible for the IT capabilities they deliver. DevOps\n\n\nDevOps principles say “run what you build.” The point—an important cultural difference from previous ways of doing IT—is that a team doesn’t toss its work over to someone else to manage when it claims to be “finished.”\n\n\nDevOps is a model bureaucracy because it’s empowering while structured and controlled; lean as a matter of principle; and set up to learn through feedback loops and monitoring.\n\n\nJoseph Clippinger III’s The Biology of Business to present the idea of businesses as complex adaptive systems (CASs). The idea of a CAS is based on biological systems that continuously adapt to survive natural selection. Managers in a CAS set up “fitness” parameters and then leave the business free to evolve, expecting that the processes most fit to deliver successful results will naturally survive.\n\n\nAdler lists a set of conditions he believes are necessary for innovative behavior: a) a minimum of employment security b) a professional orientation toward the performance of duties c) established work groups that command the allegiance of their members d) the absence of basic conflict between work group and management e) organizational needs that are experienced as disturbing25\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of bureaucracy, as I’ve said, is that it’s self-documenting; that is, you not only comply but provide evidence that you have complied.\n\n\nVirtually any complex task involving many variables whose values and interactions cannot be accurately forecast belongs to this genre: building a house, repairing a car, perfecting a new jet engine, surgically repairing a knee, or farming a plot of land. Where the interactions involve not just the material environment but social interaction as well—building and peopling new villages or cities, organizing a revolutionary seizure of power, or collectivizing agriculture—the mind boggles at the\n\n\n1) difficult to make a mistake to begin with; (2) easy to identify a problem or know when a mistake was made; (3) easy in the normal course of doing the work to notify a supervisor of the mistake or problem; and (4) consistent in what would happen next, which is that the supervisor would quickly determine what to do about it.\n\n\nThis all took place within a traditional management hierarchy, well supplied with layers of middle management. Managers, however, were taught to view themselves as problem-solvers whose responsibility was to help the floor workers realize their process improvements. They were valued for their expertise, and it was through this expertise that they become managers. It was Weberian “domination through knowledge.”\n\n\nRelation to their systems most systematisers are like a man who builds an enormous castle and lives in a shack close by; they do not live in their own enormous systematic buildings.\n\n\n† This is the same IG that put the critical fact that he was comparing a twenty-year cost to a thirty-year cost into a footnote in his report, so take his testimony with more grains of salt than perhaps he has budgeted for. -au. In relation to their systems most systematisers are like a man who builds an enormous castle and lives in a shack close by; they do not live in their own enormous systematic buildings.\n\n\nIn relation to their systems most systematisers are like a man who builds an enormous castle and lives in a shack close by; they do not live in their own enormous systematic buildings.\n\n\nFor example, James Joyce, in writing Ulysses, famously said that he wanted to write a book from which a reader could reconstruct all of Dublin on June 14, 1906.\n\n\nWriting the document forces the project teams to think ahead. But how valuable is that, really? Events they don’t plan for will still turn up by surprise; it’s impossible to foresee everything in such complex undertakings.\n\n\nWe’ll also describe our concepts for support and interoperability. (“We will support the software by fixing the bugs. The system will interoperate with our other systems.”\n\n\nTasks that will improve the metric. Studies of pay-for-performance medical programs, for example, note that they “can reward only what can be measured and attributed, a limitation that can lead to less holistic care and inappropriate concentration of the doctor’s gaze on what can be measured rather than what is important.”16 In “Don’t Let Metrics Undermine Your Business,” Harris and Tayler cite Wells Fargo’s debacle in which 3.5 million accounts were opened without the customers’ authorization. Wells was using a cross-selling metric to track its progress against a strategic objective of deepening relationships with customers. Unfortunately, the metric itself became the objective, and the company wound up accomplishing the opposite of the strategic goal that inspired it.17 When a window tax was instituted in England in 1696 and later in France during the revolution, the result was unfortunately predictable. The tax was intended to be progressive, based on an expectation\n\n\nIn practice, metrics result in gaming, perhaps through a hyperfocus on what is being measured to the exclusion of all else, or perhaps through creaming—the practice of only accepting tasks that will improve the metric.\n\n\nThe McNamara Fallacy is the mistake of making decisions based only on quantitative factors and ignoring all others. It was identified by Robert McNamara, the US Secretary of Defense, during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and refers to mistakes he and his fellow “best and brightest”¶¶ advisors made during the war in Vietnam, particularly declaring that the war was going well based on the count of dead bodies (“body bags”) rather than considering less tangible factors like strategy, leadership, group cohesion, morale, and motivation.\n\n\nGoodhart’s Law, named for economist Charles Goodhart, tells us that when a measure becomes a target it stops being a good measure. His original framing was that “any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes\n\n\nNewton’s Flaming Laser Sword, also known as Alder’s Razor, is the principle that what cannot be settled by experiment is not worth debating. It’s a principle of parsimony, like Occam’s Razor, but it shears away any ideas whose effects are not observable and measurable.\n\n\nWhat we can call Scott’s Law, introduced in Seeing Like a State, is a variant on the streetlight effect: it’s his observation that there is a “strong incentive to prefer precise and standardizable measures to highly accurate ones.”\n\n\nGresham’s Law, named for Sir Thomas Gresham, a sixteenth-century financier, is an economic principle that bad money tends to drive out good money. James Q. Wilson gives us a variant that he says applies to many government bureaus: “Work that produces measurable outcomes tends to drive out work that produces unmeasurable outcomes.”\n\n\nThe most important thing I have to teach you is the importance of banging your head against the wall, repeatedly, until the wall starts to move. It worked for me.\n\n\nThe Monkey probes and provokes, learns how the organization really works—its politics, dynamics, people’s hidden motivations—then uses those learnings as a lever to move the unmovable. The Monkey does so with good humor and a light touch\n\n\nHe’s the iconoclast who questions what’s obviously true, just because it is obviously true.\n\n\nAs Kafka implies, bureaucracy in a large enterprise is complex, nuanced, and self-healing. If you change something, it adjusts and restabilizes in a new obstructionist way.\n\n\nThere’s a reason for each bit of bureaucracy. It’s not always a good reason, but the Monkey can sniff it out.\n\n\nFirst, we made sure that employees saw themselves as professionals, with a responsibility to their craft. We maintained a library of technical books in the office, brought guest speakers, conducted “safaris” where we’d visit companies to learn from their IT people, sent employees to training, and, probably most impactful, sent them out to speak at events about the innovative things we were doing. As they became more sophisticated in their knowledge of cutting-edge techniques, it was natural for them to resist the stale bureaucratic rules that had been carved in silicon in the days when it was a good practice to keep hitting the reset button on your computer and stacking your punch cards neatly. Second, we coached employees on how to reconcile our new techniques with the rules, or in finding ways to get the rules changed. They were often already in the best position to know how to do it. It was my bureaucracy-savant employees who found the right medium in which to cast our own bureaucratic artworks—I would never have thought of declaring a Management Instruction without their help. It was our project managers, well experienced in doing ineffective procurements, who could teach us what we had to change in the procurement rules.\n\n\nAnd third, we promoted our successes far and wide. By showing employees that we were actually getting somewhere in bringing new ideas into the bureaucracy, we reduced their feeling of helplessness, one shoulder-shrug at a time.\n\n\nEach passing day destroys business value, as capital is not being put to use to earn that return.\n\n\nFor example, if we need a change to one of our IT systems because of a terrorist incident and that change is being held up by minimal-value signature hunting, let’s frankly confront an official and say, “Are you comfortable that you’re risking having more people die because you’re making this take longer?”\n\n\nRed tape is an impediment. Whose job is it to remove the impediment? Yours and mine.\n\n\nAlthough Agile IT discourages the use of command-and-control authority in favor of collaborative networks and empowered teams, I found that using it to remove impediments for a team was another matter. They usually didn’t object to it.\n\n\nAt Amazon, on the other hand, we use a principle of “escalate quickly.” It reinforces the culture of leanness and urgency. I wanted my teams to believe that passively accepting an impediment and allowing it to cause delays was not okay. But,\n\n\nAt Amazon, on the other hand, we use a principle of “escalate quickly.” It reinforces the culture of leanness and urgency. I wanted my teams to believe that passively accepting an impediment and allowing it to cause delays was not okay.\n\n\nThe monkey wants to find out “How can I?” never assuming that he can’t. The answer is different in each organization and with each piece of bureaucratic apparatus. He asks questions like these: What can I do that will help me learn how to get things done? How can I get the overseers to have skin in the game? How can I use my personal relationships? What’s the critical impediment right now? What can I do to overcome it? How can I make people understand the cost of delay?\n\n\nDrawing on my fine command of the English language, I said nothing. —Robert Benchley\n\n\nAdvanced razor tip: Add up the time spent doing versus time spent watching as I discussed in Chapter 9. This is an advanced tip because it can make people feel threatened. Don’t cheat by only including the IT department. Doing includes things like writing code, testing, deploying, and engineering infrastructure. Watching includes things like project management, status meetings, management, writing (certain) documents, getting sign-offs, governance processes, compliance specialists, CMMI experts … probably most of your costs.\n\n\nRework: Because no-sayers and reviewers arrive late in a process and their job is not to improve the work but to return it for changes, rework tends to be maximized. If the pharaoh reviews the pyramid after it’s built and decides that he doesn’t like the view from his tomb—or wants more room for his harem in the next life—then the slaves will have a lot of rework ahead of them.\n\n\nOverspecification: You know the story of the $3,000 military coffee pot from Chapter 1. If you write specifications for a product before you know how much each requirement will add to the cost, then you’re making decisions with incomplete information, and it will cost you. This often happens with requirements given to an IT organization—somewhere embedded in those requirements is a feature that is enormously but not obviously expensive—only IT will know it, upon deeper analysis, but not the requestor.\n\n\nThe commentators tell us: the correct understanding of a matter and misunderstanding the matter are not mutually exclusive. —Franz Kafka, The Trial\n\n\nLike to fight, so they “play it safe” by conservatively interpreting the rules or setting even stricter rules for themselves … just to be sure. That’s why we were told that we weren’t allowed to sign time and materials contracts because “they were frowned upon,” and that there had to be parity between paper and electronic forms.\n\n\nWe learned to ask, first, where a rule came from—“Is that your rule or is it required by some law or policy?” The answer was almost always “No, it’s not my rule, it’s the law.” The second question was: “Can you point me to exactly where it says that in the law or policy?” In many cases, we found, the law said something different, if it existed at all.\n\n\nAnd I’ll say it again—those conservative interpretations have a cost. The way of the Monkey is to expose the waste. The way of the Razor is to cut it away. And the way of the Sumo Wrestler is to gain and use leverage by questioning the enforcers and examining the rules more closely.\n\n\nWe asked our bureaucratic overseers: What would make your job easier? We treated them as the customer of our new and improved oversight process. We took in their feedback frequently and adjusted our process. They hadn’t fully realized how much of a burden the old oversight process was on them, with its long and wordy documents and its drawn-out review meetings.\n\n\nAsk yourself: If employees were given the choice, would they use your bureaucratic mechanisms? If they simplify or speed up a repetitious task, probably yes. If they needlessly constrain the employee, the initial answer is probably no.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Imagined-Communities":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/Imagined-Communities","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Sociology/Imagined Communities.md","title":"Imagined Communities","links":[],"tags":["books","non-fiction","political-science","indonesia","nationalism","politics","language"],"content":"Imagined Communities\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a kinda of half Marxist, half academic book about how language primarily shaped nation-states and how written language is the primary factor of nationalism. Imagined comities, aka the nation as a concept, are shaped by languages.\nIt became obvious to me that if you consider the printing of books/printing press to be a capitalistic phenomenon, then nationalism is a capitalistic phenomenon. However, I still think it is a bit of a stretch to just take the assumptions as is. It is more complicated than that.  I think that this is a bit of a stretch, then after those assumptions, everything is capitalistic.\nIvar Aasen and New Norwegian as a driver of nationalism.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n‘The theory of nationalism represents Marxism’s great historical failure.’\n\n\nIn 1649, Charles Stuart was beheaded in the first of the modern world’s revolutions, and during the 1650s one of the more important European states was ruled by a plebeian Protector rather than a king. Yet even in the age of Pope and Addison, Anne Stuart was still healing the sick by the laying on of royal hands, cures committed also by the Bourbons, Louis XV and XVI, in Enlightened France till the end of the ancien régime.\n\n\nIt has been estimated that in the 40-odd years between the publication of the Gutenberg Bible and the close of the fifteenth century, more than 20,000,000 printed volumes were produced in Europe. Between 1500 and 1600, the number manufactured had reached between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000.\n\n\nThese deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism: what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history (scarcely more than two centuries) generate such colossal sacrifices\n\n\nNo more arresting emblems of the modern culture of nationalism exist than cenotaphs and tombs of Unknown Soldiers. The public ceremonial reverence accorded these monuments precisely because they are either deliberately empty or no one knows who lies inside them, has no true precedents in earlier times.\n\n\nWith Debray we might say, ‘Yes, it is quite accidental that I am born French; but after all, France is eternal.’\n\n\nFor present purposes, the two relevant cultural systems are the religious community and the dynastic realm. For both of these, in their heydays, were taken-for-granted frames of reference, very much as nationality is today. It is therefore essential to consider what gave these cultural systems their self-evident plausibility, and at the same time to underline certain key elements in their decomposition.\n\n\nSo today mathematical language continues an old tradition. Of what the Thai call + Rumanians have no idea, and vice versa, but both comprehend the symbol.\n\n\nThe leaders of the burgeoning Finnish nationalist movement were ‘persons whose profession largely consisted of the handling of language: writers, teachers, pastors, and lawyers. The study of folklore and the rediscovery and piecing together of popular epic poetry went together with the publication of grammars and dictionaries, and led to the appearance of periodicals which served to standardize Finnish literary (i.e. print-)language, on behalf of which stronger political demands could be advanced.’\n\n\nYet they were national independence movements. Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.’\n\n\nBefore the age of print, Rome easily won every war against heresy in Western Europe because it always had better internal lines of communication than its challengers. But when in 1517 Martin Luther nailed his theses to the chapel-door in Wittenberg, they were printed up in German translation, and ‘within 15 days had been seen in every part of the country.’\n\n\nAll, including the USA, were creole states, formed and led by people who shared a common language and common descent with those against whom they fought.\n\n\nToussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela.\n\n\nBunched geographically together, their market-centres in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were readily accessible to one another, and their populations were relatively tightly linked by print as well as commerce. The ‘United States’ could gradually multiply in numbers over the next 183 years, as old and new populations moved westwards out of the old east coast core.\n\n\nHad a sizeable English-speaking community existed in California in the eighteenth century, is it not likely that an independent state would have arisen there to play Argentina to the Thirteen Colonies’ Peru?\n\n\nCreole (Criollo) – person of (at least theoretically) pure European descent but born in the Americas (and, by later extension, anywhere outside Europe).\n\n\nIf we note that as late as 1840, even in Britain and France, the most advanced states in Europe, almost half the population was still illiterate (and in backward Russia almost 98 per cent), ‘reading classes’ meant people of some power.\n\n\nThus neither Arabs nor Chinese, though they ventured overseas in very large numbers during more or less the same centuries as the Western Europeans, successfully established coherent, wealthy, selfconsciously creole communities subordinated to a great metropolitan core. Hence, the world never saw the rise of New Basras or New Wuhans.\n\n\n‘Russification’ of the heterogeneous population of the Czar’s subjects thus represented a violent, conscious welding of two opposing political orders, one ancient, one quite new.\n\n\nSeton-Watson even goes so far as to venture that the Revolution of 1905 was ‘as much a revolution of non-Russians against Russification as it was a revolution of workers, peasants, and radical intellectuals against autocracy.\n\n\nBut there was more than an intellectual migration. Scottish politicians came south to legislate, and Scottish businessmen had open access to London’s markets. In effect, in complete contrast to the Thirteen Colonies (and to a lesser extent Ireland), there were no barricades on all these pilgrims’ paths towards the centre. (Compare the clear highway before Latin- and German-reading Hungarians to Vienna in the eighteenth century.) English had yet to become an ‘English’ language.\n\n\nDeclaring that ‘a single shelf of a good European library is worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia,’\n\n\nNothing more sharply underscores the fundamental contradiction of English official nationalism, i.e. the inner incompatibility of empire and nation.\n\n\nThat this nationalism took on an aggressive imperialist character, even outside ruling circles, can best be accounted for by two factors: the legacy of Japan’s long isolation and the power of the official-national model.\n\n\nSecond, as the words ‘Jews’ and ‘Orient’ suggest, the Anglicized monarch had imbibed the particular racisms of the English ruling class.\n\n\nMuch the most important thing about language is its capacity for generating imagined communities, building in effect particular solidarities.\n\n\nToday it may be difficult to remember that until World War II Switzerland was a poor country, with a standard of living half that of England’s, and an overwhelmingly rural country.\n\n\nAs we have seen, ‘official nationalism’ was from the start a conscious, self-protective policy, intimately linked to the preservation of imperial-dynastic interests. But once ‘out there for all to see,’ it was as copyable as Prussia’s early-nineteenth-century military reforms, and by the same variety of political and social systems.\n\n\nDying for one’s country, which usually one does not choose, assumes a moral grandeur which dying for the Labour Party, the American Medical Association, or perhaps even Amnesty International can not rival, for these are all bodies one can join or leave at easy will.\n\n\nSouth African racism has not, in the age of Vorster and Botha, stood in the way of amicable relations (however discreetly handled) with prominent black politicians in certain independent African states. If Jews suffer discrimination in the Soviet Union, that did not prevent respectful working relations between Brezhnev and Kissinger.\n\n\nContemporary nationalism is the heir to two centuries of historic change.\n\n\nThis difference owes much to census and map. New Guinea’s remoteness and rugged terrain created over the millennia an extraordinary linguistic fragmentation. When the Dutch left the region in 1963 they estimated that within the 700,000 population there existed well over 200 mostly mutually unintelligible languages.25 Many of the remoter ‘tribal’ groups were not even aware of one another’s existence.\n\n\n(When one thinks of the sheer logistical problems involved, the ability of London and Madrid to carry on long counter-revolutionary wars against rebel American colonists is quite impressive.)\n\n\n‘les massacres du Midi’ alluded to the extermination of the Albigensians across the broad zone between the Pyrenees and the Southern Alps, instigated by Innocent III, one of the guiltier in a long line of guilty popes?\n\n\n‘la Saint-Barthélemy’ referred to the ferocious anti-Huguenot pogrom launched on 24 August 1572 by the Valois dynast Charles IX and his Florentine mother;\n\n\nSo I was not at all down hearted when a generally favourable reviewer still rather irritably described the book as being too Marxist for a liberal, and too liberal for a Marxist.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/The-Dictator's-Handbook":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Sociology/The-Dictator's-Handbook","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Sociology/The Dictator's Handbook.md","title":"The Dictator's Handbook","links":["Bureaucracy/Seeing-Like-a-State"],"tags":["english-language","non-fiction","political-science","power","politics","economics","system-thinking"],"content":"The Dictator’s Handbook\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nNobody rules alone. In order to rule you need to reward your supporters. Everyone who wastes money is likely to be replaced by those who don’t.  The more concentrated your supporting groups are, the more power is given to them.\n🎨 Impressions\nA bit of a sobering read, where the hunger for power sweeps away the good intentions displayed by people. There is some encouraging reading as well on how we can design good systems. One interesting effect is that the authors argue that foreign aid is just increasing the likelihood that dictators will stay in power. In order for dictators to lose power, they need to lose the money/go broke.\nRules for Rulers on YouTube by CGPGray is an interesting quick talk related to this book.\nThis book is interesting in that it looks at political science from almost a first principles type of thinking, which is quite different from a lot of other perspectives.\nMore able to understand the dynamics of power and use political science’s first principles to create mental models of the political spectrum was definetly something that affected me when I read this book.  I think that being more in line with what drives the power structures is quite interesting.\nTo be fair, it is a bit of a cynical book and do not take it too literary. It does not account for the irrationality of people, and it might be a useful and interesting book that gives a lot of the underlying  principles it will never be good at predicting unique cases.\nA good book to also consider is the Seeing Like a State which deals more with some of the technical problem of state systems.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThird, when the small group of cronies knows that there is a large pool of people waiting on the sidelines, hoping to replace them in the queue for gorging at the public trough, then the top leadership has great discretion over how revenue is spent and how much to tax.\n\n\nL’etat, c’est moi: the state, it is me.\n\n\nA simple way to think of these groups is: interchangeables, influentials, and essentials. In the United States, the voters are the nominal selectorate—interchangeables. As for the real selectorate—influentials—the electors of the electoral college really choose the president (just like the party faithful picked their general secretary back in the USSR). Still, the electors nowadays are normatively bound to vote the way their state’s voters voted, so they don’t really have much independent clout in practice. In the United States, the nominal selectorate and real selectorate are, therefore, pretty closely aligned. This is why, even though you’re only one among many voters, interchangeable with others, you still feel like your vote is influential—that it counts and is counted. The winning coalition—essentials—in the United States is the smallest bunch of voters, properly distributed among the states, whose support for a candidate translates into a win\n\n\nRule 1: Keep your winning coalition as small as possible.\n\n\nRule 2: Keep your nominal selectorate as large as possible.\n\n\nRule 3: Control the flow of revenue.\n\n\nRule 4: Pay your key supporters just enough to keep them loyal.\n\n\nRule 5: Don’t take money out of your supporter’s pockets to make the people’s lives better.\n\n\nFirst, taxes diminish how hard people work. Second, some of the tax burden inevitably will fall upon the essential backers of the leader. (In general, the first constraint limits taxes in autocracies and the second constraint sets the boundary on taxes in democracies.) The third consideration is that tax collection requires both expertise and resources. The costs associated with collecting taxes limit what leaders can extract and shapes the choice of taxation methods.\n\n\nBut people who argue for debt forgiveness construct their arguments in terms of how they think the world should operate, rather than how it actually works.\n\n\nFinancial crises are one of the important reasons leaders are compelled to democratize.\n\n\nOxford is a breeding ground for authoritarians. It certainly is the alma mater of many, including Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, the Bhutto family of Pakistan, kings of Jordan, Bhutan, Malaysia, and even little Tonga.\n\n\nIn 1957, not long before Batista was overthrown by Castro’s revolution, Cuba’s infant mortality rate was 32 per 1,000 live births. This was the thirteenth best in the world at the time. To put this impressive record in perspective, Cuba was outperforming Austria, Belgium, France, Israel, Japan, Spain, Portugal, and West Germany. Today, all of these countries outrank Castro’s Cuba in infant mortality rates. Yet, until the demise of the Soviet Union, Cuba’s economic growth rate was one of the highest in Latin America and its high abortion rate—which terminates difficult, at-risk pregnancies—is 58.6 per 100, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\nThough private rewards can be provided directly out of the government’s treasury, the easiest way to compensate the police for their loyalty—including their willingness to oppress their fellow citizens—is to give them free rein to be corrupt. Pay them so little that they can’t help but realize it is not only acceptable but necessary for them to be corrupt. Then they will be doubly beholden to the regime: first, they will be grateful for the wealth the regime lets them accumulate; second, they will understand that if they waver in loyalty, they are at risk of losing their privileges and being prosecuted.\n\n\nIndeed, the word kleptocrat, meaning rule by theft, was coined to describe Mobutu’s style of governance.\n\n\nMr. Suharto, referred to by The Economist magazine as the king of kleptocrats, is alleged by Transparency International to have stolen up to $35 billion from his country. His late wife, Madame Tien, was often known as “Madame Tien percent.”\n\n\nThe truth is, foreign aid deals have a logic of their own.

It also dissects the identity politics of this latest decade and how it has evolved from French postmodernism.\n🎨 Impressions\nGonna have to read more about Orientalism and especially Edward Said to understand more about this. Will update this section when finished. Might be a good goal for 2025.\nCan one accept the underlying narrative of post-modernism without signing on to the theories building on to it? Maybe postmodernism is a good theory that do not work in practice?\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAll four of my grandparents were sent to prison for their communist beliefs during the 1920s or 1930s. All four decided to stay in Central Europe after most of their family members were murdered in the Holocaust because they were convinced that new, leftist governments would make the world a better place—managing to overcome the prejudices and tribal hatreds that had, during their lifetimes, twice set the world aflame.\n\n\n“Of the 139 members and candidates of the Central Committee who were elected at the 17th Congress,” which had taken place in 1934, Nikita Khrushchev announced, “98 persons, i.e. 70 percent, were arrested and shot.”\n\n\nLyotard wrote in a line that was to prove highly influential, “I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives.”\n\n\nWhen I interviewed him in the fall of 2021, half a century after their famous debate, Chomsky remained astonished by Foucault and the wider postmodernist position he represents: “I had never met such an amoral—not immoral, amoral—person in my life.”\n\n\nKey “postmodern” theorists like Michel Foucault were steeped in communist ideas. But the core of their philosophy consisted of a rejection of all “grand narratives,” including Marxism.\n\n\nOrientalism was an enormous success. It has sold hundreds of thousands of copies since its first publication, been cited almost eighty thousand times, and influenced academics in fields from literary studies to anthropology, launching Said as one of the most famous and fashionable public intellectuals in (ironically) the Western world.\n\n\nPostcolonial scholars like Edward Said and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak sought to speak to the challenges facing former colonies from Asia to Africa without embracing the long-standing Western traditions they distrusted. Postmodernism, with its attack on supposedly universal truths, provided them with a key tool for doing so.\n\n\n“Racism,” he contended, is not “a holdover from slavery that the nation both wants to cure and is capable of curing.” Rather, it is “an integral, permanent, and indestructible component of this society.”\n\n\nThis idea became a central component of critical race theory. According to Bell, for example, “a neutral perspective does not, and cannot, exist.”\n\n\nIn other countries, the belief in the political power of verbal redescription has even led to calls to change fundamental aspects of a language’s grammar. In Germany, for example, activists have long militated against the language’s traditional use of the generic masculine to refer to groups of people comprising both men and women (for example, by replacing Studenten with Studierende). More recently, they have even begun to insist on using a so-called gender star in writing—as well as a short pause, to be deployed before the ending of every gendered noun, in verbal communication—to render ordinary language more inclusive of people who are nonbinary.\n\n\nWriters and orators from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama were up-front in their criticisms of America’s shortcomings. But they also insisted that the country’s founding principles could, if only they were fully put into practice, guide America toward a better future. The rejection of this hard-won optimism is a key theme of the identity synthesis.\n\n\nIn the years before his premature death of leukemia, in 2003, Edward Said became very critical of the way in which the identity synthesis was starting to transform intellectual life in the United States. Identity, he said at one point, is “as boring a subject as one can imagine.”\n\n\n“Marginality and homelessness are not, in my opinion, to be gloried in; they are to be brought to an end, so that more, and not fewer, people can enjoy the benefits of what has for centuries been denied the victims of race, class, or gender.”\n\n\nGradually, the triple influence of postmodernism, postcolonialism, and critical race theory gave rise to an “identity synthesis.” This new ideology was defined by seven major themes: a rejection of the existence of objective truth; the use of a form of discourse analysis for explicitly political ends; an embrace of strategic essentialism; a deep pessimism about the possibility of overcoming racism or other forms of bigotry; a preference for public policies that explicitly distinguish between citizens on the basis of the group to which they belong; an embrace of intersectionality as a strategy for political organizing; and a deep skepticism about the ability of members of different groups to communicate with each other.\n\n\nThe share of New York Times articles using the term “racist,” for example, increased by an astonishing 700 percent in the eight years between 2011 and 2019, according to an analysis by Zach Goldberg, a doctoral student in political science at Georgia State University. Over the same time period, uses of the word “racist” in The Washington Post increased even more quickly, by 1,000 percent.[]*\n\n\nAt American colleges, incoming students are twice as likely to say that they are liberal as to say that they are conservative. Faculty are even more likely to lean left than their students: professors are six times more likely to say that they are liberal than to say that they are conservative. Administrators have a still clearer political slant: they are twelve times more likely to call themselves liberal than they are to call themselves conservative.\n\n\nOr, to quote the anthropologist Roy D’Andrade: “Isn’t it odd that the true enemy of society turns out to be that guy in the office down the hall?”\n\n\n“If you’re a white person in America, social justice educator Robin DiAngelo has a message for you: You’re a racist, pure and simple.”\n\n\nThe effect of DiAngelo’s book was to mainstream a non-falsifiable theory: All white people are racist. And if you disagree, that merely proves how racist you are.\n\n\nAs Joseph Stein, who wrote the musical’s book, recalls, “I got there just during the rehearsal period and the Japanese producer asked me, ‘Do they understand this show in America?’ And I said, ‘Yes, of course, we wrote it for America. Why do you ask?’ And he said, ‘Because it’s so Japanese.’ ”\n\n\nHomo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto, a character in a play by the ancient Roman playwright Terence famously said: “I am human, and nothing human is alien to me.”\n\n\nToday, philosophers debate such questions as the difference between “true belief” (when our beliefs happen to be true because we get lucky) and genuine “knowledge” (when our beliefs are both true and justified in the right ways).\n\n\nThe first core claim of standpoint theory runs into trouble because it is extremely hard to identify meaningful experiences that all members of a socially relevant group share.\n\n\nBut of late, Juno Mac and Molly Smith have put forward strong arguments against the Nordic model. Based on their own experiences as sex workers, they claim that these laws are likely to do significant harm. Where sex work is outlawed, potential clients have a strong reason to solicit prostitutes in hidden or remote places. They are also in a stronger negotiating position because the fear of being punished drives down the number of potential customers. Due to these mechanisms, which most feminists had overlooked, the Nordic model, according to this argument, puts sex workers at greater risk of harm.\n\n\nTrying to find some primordially authentic culture can be like peeling an onion. The textiles most people think of as traditional West African cloths are known as Java prints; they arrived in the 19th century with the Javanese batiks sold, and often milled, by the Dutch. The traditional garb of Herero women in Namibia derives from the attire of 19th-century German missionaries, though it is still unmistakably Herero, not least because the fabrics used have a distinctly un-Lutheran range of colors.\n\n\nWhether located in the beige cubicles of Washington, D.C., or the gleaming open-floor offices of Silicon Valley, the people who are sufficiently powerful to serve as censors would quickly supplant the interests of society with their own concerns. As political scientists and organizational sociologists have shown again and again, people who are in charge of influential social institutions tend to guard their power jealously. Similarly, the bureaucrats who would run the (fictitious) Federal Censor’s Bureau, or the executives who might be in charge of Facebook’s (equally fictitious) Speech Facilitation Committee, would likely want to ensure that they can continue to do their jobs.\n\n\nFree speech acts as a safety valve that helps to alert all of us when something in our society has gone well and truly awry. So when certain positions or policies are put beyond reproach, the prospect for social progress diminishes. Those who believe that building more housing would bring down rent and increase economic opportunity can no longer make their arguments to their fellow citizens.\n\n\nRauch points out, cancellation “is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity.”\n\n\nOnly one country radically deviated from this plan: the United States. In its preliminary recommendations, the key committee advising the Centers for Disease Control proposed putting eighty-seven million “essential workers”—a broad category that would include bankers and film crews—ahead of the elderly.\n\n\nWhen Tamika Mallory, one of the founders of the Women’s March, was criticized for calling the proudly anti-Semitic (as well as homophobic and misogynistic) Louis Farrakhan “the greatest of all time,” for example, she defended herself by telling The New York Times that “white Jews, as white people, uphold white supremacy.”\n\n\nBut the denial of biological sex is wrongheaded. Both scientists and medical professionals, for example, know that biological sex is a key determinant of important human attributes, from the prevalence of heart disease to the ability to become pregnant.\n\n\nAnd in the case of the identity synthesis, such an analysis reveals three foundational claims. 1. The key to understanding the world is to examine it through the prism of group identities like race, gender, and sexual orientation.[]*\n\n\nSupposedly universal values and neutral rules merely serve to obscure the ways in which privileged groups dominate those that are marginalized.\n\n\nTo build a just world, we must adopt norms and laws that explicitly make the way the state treats each citizen—and how citizens treat each other—depend on the identity group to which they belong.\n\n\nAdvocates of the identity synthesis have long thought of philosophical liberals as their main adversaries. To evaluate the identity synthesis and its attack on liberalism, it makes sense to boil this tradition down to its main claims. Such a “rational reconstruction” would focus on three propositions. First, the key to understanding the world is to examine it through the prism of group identities like race, gender, and sexual orientation. Second, supposedly universal values and neutral rules merely serve to obscure the ways in which privileged groups dominate those that are marginalized. And third, to build a just world, we must adopt norms and laws that explicitly make the way the state treats each citizen—and how citizens treat each other—depend on the identity group to which they belong.\n\n\nThe story of humanity is an annal of cruelty and injustice.\n\n\nThe identity synthesis presents itself as a progressive ideology that tries to remake the world in a radical fashion. But this radical paint job fails to obscure its deep pessimism or the poverty of its ambitions. At the heart of its vision stands an acceptance of the enduring importance of dubious categories like race. It tries to sell people on a future in which people will forever be defined by the identity groups to which they belong; in which different communities will always be mired in zero-sum competition; and in which the way we treat each other will forever depend on our respective skin colors and sexual proclivities.\n\n\n“I want my two sons to understand that responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy is not principally about noticing what’s bad; it’s about constructing what’s good.”\n\n\nA few weeks before the 2022 midterms, Barack Obama warned that “sometimes people just want to not feel as if they are walking on eggshells. They want some acknowledgment that life is messy and that all of us, at any given moment, can say things the wrong way.”\n\n\n“In the 1960s, left-wing radicals wanted to overthrow capitalism. We ended up with Whole Foods,” David Brooks notes in The New York Times.\n\n\nAccording to one recent study, for example, the great majority of Americans, including most Republicans, believe that “it’s important that every American student learn about slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation”; “Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks should be taught as examples of Americans who fought for equality”; and “America is better today because women, immigrants, and Black Americans have made progress towards equality.”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/A-New-Economics":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/A-New-Economics","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/A New Economics.md","title":"A New Economics","links":["Mich/Zen--and--The-Art-of-Motorcycle-Maintenance"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","system-thinking","economics","complexity","industry","processes","manufacturing"],"content":"A New Economics\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA bit of a challenge to the old way of thinking of economics. Edward Demming is a classic within process thinking and system thinking.

The basic problem anywhere is quality. What is quality? A product or a service possesses quality if it helps somebody and enjoys a good and sustainable market. Trade depends on quality.\n\n\nHave we been living on fat? Some countries live in part by export of nonrenewable materials such as oil, coal, iron ore, copper, aluminum, scrap metal. These are temporary blessings: they can not last forever. To live on gifts, credit, or borrowed money is not a long-term solution, either.\n\n\nOne of our best exports, one that brings in dollars, is materials for war. We could greatly expand this income but for moral reasons. American aircraft have about 70 per cent of the world market, and bring in huge amounts of dollars. Another important export is scrap metal. We can’t use it, so we sell it. The Japanese paid us about 18 cents for the metal in the microphone that I use in lectures. We buy the metal back from them in the form of a microphone for 2000, possibly 1800—value added!\n\n\nPeople are asking for better schools, with no clear idea how to improve education, nor even how to define improvement of education.\n\n\nA letter to the London Times, 7 July 1990, displayed the fact that 23 per cent of the cost of running a hospital in the United States goes for administration, against only 5 per cent in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nRanking is a farce. Apparent performance is actually attributable mostly to the system that the individual works in, not to the individual himself.\n\n\nThe aim of anybody, under the merit system, is to please the boss. The result is destruction of morale. Quality suffers.\n\n\nAnother example is pressure that he exerts to hold on to a naval base in his state, when Congress has decreed national reduction in naval bases. Can you blame him? Reelection depends on his success to hold on to a naval base in his state, regardless of what is best for the nation as a whole.\n\n\nShe discovered (e.g.) that the people engaged in design and redesign of product or service did not talk to the people engaged in consumer research. To talk with them might suggest to the management that we don’t know our business here: we had to ask for help from those people in consumer research. Let there never be any suspicion that we don’t possess knowledge necessary for our work.\n\n\nMr. H. R. Carabelli of Michigan Bell Telephone Company remarked to me that a company could have the best Product engineer, the best manufacturing engineer, the best man in the country in marketing, yet if these men do not work together as a system, the company could be swallowed whole by the competition with people far less qualified, but with good management.\n\n\nA system is a network of interdependent components that work together to try to accomplish the aim of the system. A system must have an aim. Without an aim, there is no system.\n\n\nInterdependence. The greater the interdependence between components, the greater will be the need for communication and cooperation between them. Also, the greater will be the need for overall management.\n\n\nInformation is not knowledge. We are today in possession of instant communication with any part of the world. Unfortunately, speed does not help anyone to understand the future and the obligations of management. Many of us deceive ourselves into the supposition that we need constant updating to cope with the rapidly changing future. But you can not, by watching every moment of television, or by reading every newspaper, acquire a glimpse of what the future holds.\n\n\nI repeat here Norb Keller’s famous statement made on 8 November 1987 in a meeting in General Motors: “If General Motors were to double the pay of everybody commencing the first of December, performance would be exactly what it is now.”\n\n\nA bonus for high rank in the ranking of people, teams, divisions, regions, brings demoralization to all the people concerned, including him that receives the bonus.\n\n\nSystems of reward now in place may actually be overjustification. Monetary reward to somebody, or a prize, for an act or achievement that he did for sheer pleasure and self-satisfaction may be viewed as overjustification.\n\n\nYou can not plan to make a discovery.—Irving Langmuir\n\n\nAs I use the term here, the job of a leader is to accomplish transformation of his organization.

It goes into detail on credit cards, debit cards, checking and other systems. It contains an overview of the how and why of each system.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is a small book, with short but interesting discussions and sections. Most of it is maybe a bit out of the interest sphere of everyday people, but I found it very interesting. It has useful and insightful anecdotes that make reading the book worthwhile. Checking might not be that relevant to me, but I still felt it was interesting to understand how the checking system evolved and, therefore, also led to new developments.\nThis comment rings true to a lot of the thoughts in the book. \nHow I Discovered It\nA thread on hacker news, not everyone needs to read payment systems in the U. S. was a comment, so I decided to read it.\nWho Should Read It?\nIf you are very interested in payment systems and how it works.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI was quite astonished at how immensely profitable the credit card industry is for Visa and Mastercard. Just free money more or less.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThere are six core payments systems in the United States: Cash The checking system The credit card and charge card systems The debit card systems The ACH (Automated Clearing House) system The wire transfer systems\n\n\nThe earliest check clearing house was a simple meeting, each business morning, of representatives from each participating bank in a city. Clerks from each of the banks would come to the clearing house bearing bags of checks. At the clearing house, the checks would be exchanged and each clerk would depart with the checks written on accounts at his bank. (It is interesting to note that in the early phases of the card industry, paper “sales drafts” were cleared in much the same way.\n\n\nThe original American Express and Discover systems, and the proprietary card systems (for example, a Sears credit card accepted only at Sears) are examples of closed loop systems.\n\n\n“On-us” transactions occur when the bank intermediary is the same on both sides of a transaction.\n\n\n“Push” payments are fundamentally much less risky than “pull” payments. In a “push” payment, the party who has funds is sending the money, so there is essentially no risk of NSF, or nonsufficient funds—”push” payments can’t “bounce.”\n\n\n“Pull” payments are inherently subject to “bouncing.”\n\n\nCard networks are fundamentally “pull” payment networks. Card payments don’t bounce—but this doesn’t mean that they are push transactions.\n\n\nThe check payments system in the U.S., as discussed above, is a “virtual” system with no central authority. Banks do, however, join one or more check clearing houses to process checks\n\n\nVisa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal are all examples of what we call “thick model” networks. Other networks are thinly resourced, and manage only minimal interoperability issues, leaving functions such as product definition and brand to intermediaries.\n\n\nCheck clearing houses, the ACH, and PIN debit networks are all examples of this “thin model”.\n\n\nIn a “thick model”, the network enables significant profits for the funding member banks. In a “thin model”, the network exists to reduce costs (for example, in check processing), and so is operated as an efficient utility.\n\n\nThe word itself comes from the Arabic word şakk. There\n\n\nThe origins of the checking system as we know it today can be traced to medieval, and perhaps earlier, times—many economies developed some version of a document that allowed the transfer of funds from one bank to another. The word itself comes from the Arabic word şakk\n\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the introduction and widespread use of MICR (magnetic ink character recognition) characters enabled high-speed check processing. MICR characters, identifying the bank and account a check is drawn on, appear at the bottom of a check.\n\n\nGrounded Planes: The events of September 11, 2001, are often cited as the reason for the Fed’s actions in championing the Check 21 law. When planes didn’t fly, and checks didn’t move, for days after the attacks, the float at the Federal Reserve Bank (which technically acts as a correspondent bank in check processing:\n\n\nIn the abstract, float refers to a gap in the availability of funds transferred between two parties.\n\n\nFor funds received, prior to collecting from the paying bank. (Historically, the Fed has done this as a way to manage, on behalf of the presenting bank, uncertainties in check collection.) Often float is more a matter of perception: “disbursement float” is a term used to describe the gap between when a corporation mails a check (and presumably discharges its obligation to a vendor) and the time that the check is actually presented to its bank for payment. Float is often discussed in relative terms: if a bank has been collecting deposited checks on an average of 1.5 days after receipt, and it reduces that to an average of 1.25 days, it has improved float. If a bank makes good funds available to a depositing customer prior to receiving payment on the check in question, it is incurring a float expense—which may be theoretical, rather than actual, if the customer in question leaves the balances in the account. Confused? Here’s one thing to remember about float.\n\n\nIn the U.S., bank exposure to check fraud is generally believed to be less than $1 billion annually.\n\n\nThe third party in the example above is at extreme risk if the consumer transaction is fraudulent—e.g., if the consumer has given someone else’s bank account information. To manage this risk, PayPal early on developed a “micro deposit” scheme designed to verify account ownership. By making two small, random deposits in the consumer’s bank account, and then asking the consumer to report the amounts, PayPal can verify that the consumer is the valid owner of that bank\n\n\nThe third party in the example above is at extreme risk if the consumer transaction is fraudulent—e.g., if the consumer has given someone else’s bank account information.

If a merchant captures the CVV2/CVC2 from the cardholder and forwards it in the authorization message to the issuer, the issuer will respond by indicating its validity—or lack thereof. This helps prevent fraud where a card number is known but where the fraudster hasn’t had access to the physical card.\n\n\nContactless cards use a simpler chip, based on RFID (radio frequency) technology, to pass data between the card and an RFID reader at a POS terminal. Contactless cards are implemented primarily as a customer convenience (for speed of checkout), rather than for fraud management—although they contain technology analogous to the CVV/CVC on the magnetic stripe that helps reduce counterfeit fraud at contactless acceptance locations.\n\n\nContactless acceptance devices are also important to the deployment of certain kinds of mobile payments—particularly those based on the use of near-field communication (NFC) technology.\n\n\nCard volume by type looks very different if you look at transaction count vs. transaction amount. Debit transactions exceed credit transactions by count, but are less by amount due to the higher “average ticket” on credit cards vs. debit cards.\n\n\nThe revenue models for the card networks consist of processing fees and brand-use service fees assessed on all transactions made with a card carrying the network brand.\n\n\nThe credit card has been called “the most profitable product in banking history” in the United States. With industry revenues estimated at more than $140 billion annually (accruing to MasterCard and Visa bank issuers, for credit cards alone), it is clearly an attractive business.\n\n\nNear-universal acceptance. Almost all retail establishments in the U.S. accept credit cards, as do many non-retail enterprises, including billers, B2B manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers, governments, nonprofits, and educational institutions. A saturated marketplace. Almost 80% of American households—more than 90 million households or about 175 million individuals—had one or more credit cards at the end of 2008. Many Americans without access to credit have debit or prepaid cards. Multiple cards. Of Americans who have a credit card, most have more than five cards each. They are used to choosing between those cards at the point of sale based on a wide variety of factors, including available credit lines, rewards, and purpose of the purchase.\n\n\nIn Greenback, his book about cash, Jason Goodwin notes, “There are more dollar bills in existence than any other branded object, including Coke cans”.\n\n\nThe failure of the German bank Herstatt in 1974, during the course of a day, caused huge losses worldwide and a cascade of bank failures. This type of risk, which became known as “Herstatt risk”,\n\n\nSWIFT can be thought of as “the payments system that isn’t a payments system.” SWIFT is a global messaging network for the financial services industry, through which participating members, including banks and securities firms, can send each other secure, structured messages.\n\n\nConvenience helps instill confidence and inspires frequent usage. Anything that gets in the way of convenience—call it “friction”—is likely to dramatically reduce potential consumer acceptance.\n\n\nFinancial gains have to be significant to matter to consumers—significant enough to overcome existing habits and preferences about ways to pay\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we must not forget that the actual making of a payment is not the consumer’s real focus. Rather, consumers want to own the products they’re purchasing, or experience the service, or pay off a liability incurred to another. That’s where the rewards are—not in the payment mechanism itself!\n\n\nAs it turns out, only some 350 major merchants are responsible for about half of all payment card transactions. Similarly, in the eCommerce world, the top 100 eRetailers account for over half the spending in their segment.\n\n\nThere are more than 27 million enterprises in the United States—including businesses, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and local governments and agencies.\n\n\n*In the U.S., to start a bank, you need a charter from an issuing agency—a state or federal chartering authority. The chartering authority examines the business plan, management competency, and capital adequacy of the proposed bank. The charter, when issued, defines the capabilities of the bank. The key activity is deposit taking.\n\n\nA non-bank can lend money or handle payments, but only a chartered institution can accept consumer deposits into a transaction account.\n\n\nBanks make money by lending money, by holding money (in deposit accounts or investment accounts), and by moving money—moving money means payments. Although all three activities are profitable for banks, the relative profits are highest for lending, and lending activities tend to dominate a bank’s management agenda.\n\n\nIt’s hard to imagine, from the standpoint of the present, just how innovative and frankly amazing the ATM was. Customers who once spent their lunch hours waiting in line to deposit a paycheck and get grocery money could now take care of business on their way home from work—or after church on Sunday.\n\n\nFamously, Visa and MasterCard used to require acquiring bank contracts to bind merchants to their rules—without letting the merchants see the rules! Today, both organizations make the rules available on their websites.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Recoding-America":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Recoding-America","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/Recoding America.md","title":"Recoding America","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","it-projects","system-thinking","bureaucracy"],"content":"Recoding America\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is an investigation into the issues plaguing governmental organizations and what can be done about it.\n🎨 Impressions\nOne thing is that even though this is a book written by a tech person, the views presented in the book were quite interesting and progressive.\nGovernment and IT might not be a match made in heaven, but it ait impossible either.\nThere are a lot of problems with the government, and too many laws might be the biggest ones. Furthermore, all the laws are a mesh of special cases or edge cases that make the normal processes into a bog of bureaucracy.\nI am getting more and more convinced that waterfall and agile are not about teams and how they work but more about organizational culture.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nHaving a felony on your record can make it very hard to get a job. Most employers won’t even consider you, and fields that require any kind of occupational licensing, from medical assistance to cosmetology, become off-limits. Former felons also can’t join the military. And it’s not just employment. With a felony record, it’s hard to rent an apartment or get a home loan. Veterans with felony convictions are denied certain retirement benefits. Students with drug felonies can’t deduct their tuition from their taxes, the way others can.\n\n\nWhites and people of color use marijuana at approximately the same rates, but people of color went to jail for it nearly four times more often, which meant that the new law would create opportunity disproportionately for white people.\n\n\nMedicare, the federal government’s medical insurance plan for seniors, has achieved remarkable success since its inception in 1965, when 48 percent of the elderly lacked health coverage. Today just 2 percent do. In approximately the same period, the United States has enjoyed a fifteen-year increase in life expectancy, in part because of the greater access to care that the program provides.\n\n\nThree months into my new job, I watched the much-heralded launch of healthcare.gov, which would administer Obama’s signature policy initiative, the Affordable Care Act. The site immediately crashed. With millions to enroll and hundreds of thousands attempting to log on at any given moment, it managed on its first day to serve a total of eight people.\n\n\nOne reason these common prescriptions sound attractive is that they are partially right. More money can be useful, of course, and is often necessary—but having big budgets from the start can be deadly, since they often require an entire megaproject to be planned up front, reducing the ability of the team to learn as it goes. More modern technology can be handy—but successive layers of policy, regulation, procedure, and process that have accrued over decades encumber our digital services and make even the most modern technologies opaque and hard to use. More outsourcing can help with some aspects of service delivery, and contractors are a valuable piece of the implementation puzzle—but government can work well with these critical players only when it can bring its own basic digital competency to bear as well.\n\n\nDigital work, which in our larger society commands so much attention (whether it’s lionized or vilified), in government is reduced to an afterthought. It’s not what important people do, and important people don’t do it.\n\n\nJoe Soss, a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, found in the 1990s that participating in means-tested programs—benefits that you must prove that you are poor enough to qualify for—significantly reduces the chance you will vote.\n\n\nBy July 2020, the state’s unemployment insurance had paid out about $50 billion since the lockdowns began, and about 4.4 million Californians were receiving benefits.\n\n\nApplicants were calling the EDD in record numbers, but only a tiny fraction of the calls were even being answered (I would later learn it was about one in a thousand) and when calls did get picked up it was by newly hired staffers who had no training or access to EDD systems and could only encourage the callers to continue to wait.\n\n\nSpending time with frontline staff, watching them work, and asking questions about how and why they do what they do are critical.\n\n\nOne reason the IRS has so much trouble modernizing its systems, for instance, is that there are over seventy-three thousand pages in the statutes and regulations the agency must implement. Between 2001 and 2012, the tax code changed 4,680 times, an average of once per day. When former IRS commissioner John Koskinen would get called in front of Congress and its members would gripe about the tax system, he would shake his head and say, “I didn’t write the tax laws, you did.” He had a point.\n\n\nThe federal DOL sets the goal for timeliness of payments at 87 percent, meaning that state labor agencies get a good grade even if one in every eight workers who apply has to wait over three weeks to receive a first payment.\n\n\nSome states still using mainframes, like New Jersey and Rhode Island, paid benefits much faster than others like Florida, which had ostensibly modernized.\n\n\nThe EDD in California, that’s the recomps, those claims that need to be handled manually. As long as the training manual is eight hundred pages, as long as seventeen-year veterans of the department are still getting up to speed, making the tech better will be of only marginal help. Modernizing technology without rationalizing and simplifying the policy and processes it must support seldom works.\n\n\nLawmakers were furious at state-level bureaucrats for their failures during the pandemic, but it’s the lawmakers who have insisted on petty provisions like docking a claimant’s benefits because the person had a cold one day.\n\n\nA SURE SIGN of a waterfall organization is how the people within it treat data. In an agile, empowered organization, data is a useful tool for adjusting course. The people in the organization not only have access to data and the ability to understand it but have the power to decide what to do based on it. If the compass says you’ve drifted off course, no one summons the inspector general or calls for a hearing. You just turn the wheel.\n\n\nIn a waterfall organization, on the other hand, data functions less like a compass that helps you steer and more like an after-the-fact evaluation, a grade you get that says how well or poorly you did on something that has already happened. That’s why there was such a big fight at the state assembly’s EDD hearings about how many claims were backlogged. Paula wanted the backlog to be 239,000, not the 1.2 million it was eventually assessed at, because while the difference may only have been between a D and an F, that mattered to a leader who cared about the reputation of her department. For people stuck in waterfall frameworks, data is not a tool in their hands. It’s something other people use as a stick to beat them with.\n\n\nI met a lawyer from the California state government who was providing legal advice to our team. He had filled out an unemployment application on behalf of his mother, who had lost her job when the pandemic hit in March, and provided her first name, middle initial, and last name just the way she usually signed them. But her Social Security card carried her full middle name, so her application had been flagged for manual processing. It was now September and they hadn’t heard anything back. His mother, who had had high hopes for her claim given her son’s familiarity with the state’s policies and procedures, was not very pleased with him.\n\n\nToday, if there’s any relationship between inaccuracy of the applicant data and fraud, it’s an inverse correlation.\n\n\nThat number could be reduced if the EDD loosened the criteria that were flagging claims for manual processing, but Paula wouldn’t hear of relaxing what she thought of as fraud prevention practices. Those practices were not, in fact, preventing fraud. As proof, Marina’s team took claims that had been flagged for further identity verification during the previous quarter and looked at what the EDD had decided to do with them after its manual review. Out of 183,167 claims, only 804 were judged to be imposters. And even among those 804, many of them were likely to be not actually fraudulent.\n\n\nIn other words, only about 0.2 percent of applicants who were flagged for identity verification turned out to be committing fraud.\n\n\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal put it this way: “I tell people, ‘Don’t follow my orders. Follow the orders I would have given you if I were there and knew what you know.’”\n\n\nState and federal civil service rules are a big part of that system, but they are simply the expression of a culture in which fidelity to flawed rules and practices is valued more than solving problems.\n\n\nWe want to do away with the waterfall, we have to learn how to recognize it. It can be hard to notice because it most often shows up not in what people say but in what they don’t say, like when Paula stayed mum about the impact of the hiring spree because she knew no one wanted to hear it.\n\n\nTHE GLOBAL POSITIONING System has to be one of the most successful investments the US has ever made, and not just because GPS-enabled map apps on mobile phones have saved the directionally challenged like me from perpetually getting lost. GPS also powers thousands of critical services that we take for granted today, like routing cell phone calls, sending electricity to our homes, and enabling us to get cash from an ATM. Even stock exchange trades now rely on GPS.\n\n\nIn 1983, however, the crew of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, flying from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska, made an error in their navigational calculations and accidentally strayed into the prohibited airspace of the USSR. Mistaking the airliner for a spy plane, the Soviets shot it down, killing all 269 people aboard, including Larry McDonald, a US congressman from Georgia. Recognizing that GPS could have prevented this tragedy, President Ronald Reagan directed the Department of Defense to make GPS freely available for civilian use. As a common good, it became even more powerful than Reagan could have imagined.\n\n\nTHE IEEE STANDARD Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology offers two definitions of requirement in the programming context. It can be something “needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective” or something that “must be met or possessed by a system … to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.”\n\n\nRequirements are the foundation of software development processes in government, and the source of many of its failures.\n\n\n30 Rock when TV executive Jack Donaghy briefly goes to work in government. He arrives at his new office to the sight of water dripping onto his desk and points out to one of his new colleagues that the ceiling is leaking. “No, it’s not,” says the colleague. “We’ve looked into it and it’s not. I’ll show you the study.”\n\n\nWhen Dominic tried it, he couldn’t believe it had come from the VA. He told the team it was “easy to read, straightforward, so much better.” The IEDs and the spikes were gone. But even this victory could have been short-lived. As Mary Ann and Emily suspected, Dominic had not been the only veteran who couldn’t access the previous application form. When the new form went live and worked on the vast majority of computers, the number of incoming health care applications jumped by a factor of ten. While the team celebrated, the blowback began. None of the systems that processed the applications were ready for ten times the volume. People all over the building were suddenly drowning in work, which was particularly bad because the VA was already facing fierce criticism for a myriad of other backlogs. Now there was going to be another one. Bureaucrats across the VA started calling up everyone in power: Revert to the old application form!\n\n\nThe inability to apply had been largely invisible, both in the press and inside the building, but the backlog of unprocessed applications starting to build up was very visible.\n\n\nEric Schoonover was one of Weaver’s colleagues on the OCX project. He now works for a startup defense contractor, and he has become accustomed to what he called “the weird ESB imperative.” “I’ve spent a lot of my time just relabeling presentations,” he says. “I would create a PowerPoint that described what we were doing, and then somebody would say, ‘You don’t have an ESB on here.’ So I would just relabel one of the boxes ‘ESB’ and then go through the PowerPoint again.” No one ever asked Eric which software components were using the ESB, or even if there was anything installed on the machine at all. Today, Eric’s ESBs are all fictional.\n\n\nIn the business world, they say that culture eats strategy for breakfast—meaning that the people implementing the strategy, and the skills, attitudes, and assumptions they bring to it, will make more difference than even the most brilliant plan.\n\n\nThe Trump administration ordered the Border Patrol to start separating detained children from their parents. The cruelty of the new policy provoked a storm of controversy, but while the debate raged, the agents were left to sort out the practical consequences of the sudden change. Reprocessing every child as an “unaccompanied minor” generated a new A number for each one. Previously, the only children to have their own A numbers had been those old enough to have made it across the border on their own, but now agents found themselves sticking Post-it notes with A numbers on infants’ onesies. Worse, the system had no provision for recording a link between two separate A numbers. Some border agents tried to keep notes connecting the A numbers of parents and children, but in the chaos of the rapid transition these were easily lost.\n\n\nSmall teams work, if they have the right mindset and the right skills. And the reality was that many of the thousands of people from the thirty-four outside vendors did not have the skills.\n\n\nOne of Todd’s recruits told me about finding a flaw in the code and asking one of the contractors to log in and make a change. The contractor was a member of the technical team, but this recruit had an uneasy feeling about him, so he wrote out exactly the change the contractor was to make in the code. The next day, the error had not gone away, so Todd’s group asked to look at the codebase. There was the change, just as directed—but it was preceded by two forward slashes. Two slashes before a line designated a comment, essentially a note programmers leave for the next programmer who’ll come along. The slashes told the computer not to read that line as code but to ignore it. Why did the contractor do that? “I saw other lines had these slashes so I thought I should put them in too,” he explained. This supposedly technical staff member had never written a line of code.\n\n\nJust as government’s core competency has been in contracting with vendors, some vendors’ core competency has been in getting those contracts.\n\n\nBut as Jake saw, the way you get 212 questions on a form for food assistance is not concentrated power, it’s diffuse power. And diffuse power is not just an artifact of the complexities federalism can bring, with decisions delegated down to local government and then aggregated back up through mechanisms like the county consortia. The fear of having exercised too much power, and being criticized for it, is ever present for many public servants. The result is a compulsion to consult every imaginable stakeholder, except the ones who matter most: the people who will use the service. A tech leader who\n\n\nToday, Americans spend 10.5 billion hours a year—about forty-two hours per adult—on paperwork just for the federal government.\n\n\n“In the Middle Ages, government was regarded as an essentially judicial function and all its officials, including the king, were viewed as magistrates,” writes Rubin. Earlier in American history, administrative agencies in the federal government, though not medieval, were weighted toward judicial functions as well. Before the New Deal, the number and scope of things the federal government did was much smaller, and Congress could make far more of the rules that were needed.\n\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture tried this when it was about to issue a rule regarding the minimum peanut content in peanut butter. Advocates wanted it to be at least 90 percent peanuts, manufacturers wanted to require only 87 percent peanuts, and adjudicating that 3 percent difference under the formal rulemaking process took the Food and Drug Administration twelve years of the 1960s and 1970s. The case went almost all the way to the Supreme Court, and the oral hearing alone took twenty weeks and produced a 7,736-page transcript.12 (The advocates ultimately prevailed.) Since then, when Congress writes laws, it usually avoids the words “on the record” when it comes to rulemaking, leaving agencies the option to choose the informal “notice and comment” process. Unsurprisingly, it’s chosen every time. Peanut butter killed formal rulemaking.\n\n\nJudges do not seem to care about speed, whether in the courtroom or in administrative agencies. As one analysis puts it, they want agencies to practice “intensive, multipolar forms of deliberative rulemaking,” and they tend to punish them if they deliberate too little or consult too few stakeholders.\n\n\nToday, when digital professionals come into government ready to build services for the American people, they are shocked at how hard it is to build anything at all. It’s not only because the government policies they are attempting to digitize are enormously, needlessly complex. It’s not only because they have to spend so much of their time on procurement, since the actual code writing and interface design must all be outsourced. It’s not only because seemingly arbitrary aspects of their work have been wildly overspecified by distant rule makers with little understanding of the problems at hand. And it’s not only because we put the people who build vital government technology at the bottom of the hierarchy, where they have little voice or power. It’s also because the administrative agencies many of them work for were designed—on purpose—to be unable to make the kinds of decisions that good software development requires.\n\n\nTo be sure, our government has always been dominated by lawyers. Alexis de Tocqueville remarked on this back in the 1830s, when he wrote that “the aristocracy of America is on the bench and at the bar.” More recent commentators like Nicholas Bagley blame the profusion of lawyers for what he describes as government’s “procedure fetish”: “If all you’ve got is a lawyer, everything looks like a procedural problem.”\n\n\nAs with Medicare doctors, the more information you ask for, the more you reward administrative capacity, and the harder it is to help those who need it most.\n\n\nA researcher in the UK studied one low-income family’s interaction with seventy-three different government entities, including social services, educational supports, and interventions from law enforcement, the costs of which the government had calculated topped one million pounds annually. Though these services and programs theoretically existed to support this family and keep them safe, only 14 percent of the time public servants spent on this family involved any actual interaction with them, the rest of it being spent on tasks like reporting, data entry, and interfacing with other parts of the bureaucracy.\n\n\nOf that small fraction spent face-to-face with family members, most of that was spent collecting the data that would then be put into government systems and reports. In other words, even when they were with the family, public servants were still meeting government needs.\n\n\nThe family members, unsurprisingly, experienced all of this supposed “support” as surveillance and control.\n\n\nDave Guarino, one of the three creators of GetCalFresh, says that technocrats’ desire for a comprehensive screener is a misunderstanding of client needs. The way he recommends screening clients instead is very simple: “Made less than $X last month? You may be eligible.”\n\n\n“You know what high-precision accuracy requires?” Dave asks. “A really high-burden, complex form that starts to resemble a full application.”\n\n\nPeople with means can avoid the pain of many government interactions, but when we do, we are missing a chance to build empathy for those who can’t.\n\n\nWhen the GetCalFresh team made these choices, they were practicing a discipline called product management. It is frequently confused (especially in government) with project management, but the two are distinct, and the difference between them is crucial.\n\n\nProject management is the art of getting things done. Product management is deciding what to do in the first place—and also, as in the case of the benefit screeners, deciding what not to do.\n\n\nMike Byrne, the guy who built the broadband map for the FCC, estimates that most government tech projects could cost 10 percent of what they do and still provide 85 percent of the functionality. I hereby dub this “Byrne’s Law.”\n\n\nGall’s Law, named for pediatrician and systems design theorist John Gall. “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked,” Gall wrote. “A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Systematics":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Systematics","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/Systematics.md","title":"Systematics","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking-in-Systems"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","system-thinking","non-fiction","thinking"],"content":"Systematics\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about systems, why they exist, and the rules that govern them.

It failed during normal operations and in so doing it failed to fail safely; in fact, it caused the very accident it was designed to deal with.\n\n\nAS SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THEY TEND TO LOSE BASIC FUNCTIONS\n\n\n•Thus, the loss of 50,000 American lives per year in auto accidentsis seen, not as a mortal flaw in our Transportation System, but merely as afact of life.\n\n\n•In the field of Nuclear Weaponry, the power to exterminate one’s enemy (and concomitantly oneself) ten times over is regarded as not quite enough.\n\n\n•Medical Science, in its studies of the relationship between heart disease and fats in the bloodstream, for twenty years focused its attention on the wrong fats\n\n\n•In the field of Human Behavior, an enormous research effort is being directed to proving that Mental Illness is a disease of the brain. This conviction appears to stem at least in part from a Systems-delusion, namely: IF IT’S TREATED BY DOCTORS IT MUST BE A DISEASE\n\n\nIN SETTING UP A NEW SYSTEM, TREAD SOFTLY. YOU MAY BE DISTURBING ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING\n\n\nEXPERIENCE ISN’T HEREDITARY—IT AIN’T EVEN CONTAGIOUS\n\n\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT COMMUNICATE Think of the eighteen-inch tsetse fly without any explanatory lecture. It continues to tell a story, even though the story is different for each viewer. Or think, as Bateson reminded us, of “the letter which you do not write… the income tax form which you do not fill in …” which nevertheless elicit vigorous responses.\n\n\nTHE MEANING OF A COMMUNICATION IS THE BEHAVIOR THAT RESULTS This Axiom, which flies in the face of vulgar Common Sense, is basic. It is a nettle that must be grasped, and the sooner the better. Simply put: Are we willing to subject our communications to the test of actual outcomes?\n\n\nTHE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED INFORMATION DECAYS FASTEST\n\n\nFor most of us, however, the Decay Rate of Information remains merely an interesting abstraction, for our efforts at Coping are limited by an even more drastic law, the Inaccessibility Theorem: THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU WANT. THE INFORMATION YOU WANT IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU CAN OBTAIN.\n\n\nWe summarize in the Rule of Thumb for missing information: DON’T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR IT. YOU WON’T FIND IT It will turn up later—when you no longer need it.\n\n\nDO IT WITHOUT A NEW SYSTEM IF YOU CAN\n\n\n*Two immediate Corollaries, with significant implications for Management, are as follows:\n\n\n\nDO IT WITH AN EXISTING SYSTEM IF YOU CAN\nDO IT WITH A SMALL SYSTEM IF YOU CAN\n\n\n\nAt this point one should be mindful of Agnes Allen’s Law:[i.] ALMOST ANYTHING IS EASIER TO GET INTO THAN OUT OF More specifically: TAKING IT DOWN IS OFTEN MORE TEDIOUS THAN SETTING IT UP\n\n\nIn human terms, this means working with human tendencies rather than against them. For example, a State-run lottery flourishes even in times of economic depression because its function is aligned with the basic human instinct to gamble a small stake in hopes of a large reward.\n\n\nThe Public School System, on the other hand, although founded with the highest and most altruistic goals in mind, remains in a state of chronic failure because it violates the principle of spontaneity in human learning. It goes against the grain and therefore it does not ever really succeed.  It has made literacy universal, but not truly popular.\n\n\nLOOSE SYSTEMS LAST LONGER AND FUNCTION BETTER Since most of modern life is lived in the interstices of large systems, it is of practical importance to note that LOOSE SYSTEMS HAVE LARGER INTERSTICES and are therefore generally somewhat less hostile to human life forms than tighter Systems.\n\n\nPotemkin Village Effect. The P.V.E. is especially pronounced in Five-Year Plans, which typically report sensational overachievement during the first four and a half years, followed by a rash of criminal trials of top officials and the announcement of a new and more ambitious Five-Year Plan, starting from a baseline somewhat lower than that of the preceding Plan, but with higher goals\n\n\nThe complexity consultants can no more predict the future than the clients can. Mindful of Chaos Theory, we propose our own Emendation: THE FUTURE IS NO MORE PREDICTABLE NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE PAST, BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST TAKE NOTE OF TRENDS\n\n\n•Kaiser Wilhelmof Germany, when still a boy, on a visit to his uncle, the King of England, saw the mighty English fleet and promptly dreamed of having one of his own,like Uncle Bertie’s, only bigger.\n\n\nSystems can do many things, but one thing they emphatically cannot do is to solve Problems. A System represents someone’s solution to a Problem. The System itself does notsolveProblems\n\n\nLegend has it that one of the lesser-known museums of Middle Eastern Archeology contains an ancient baked brick from the city of Ur of theChaldees upon which, five thousand years ago, a scribe had incised in cuneiform symbols the cryptic message:[a.] THE FINAL TRUTH IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER Although the original author of this insight is unknown, the belief remains alive to this day, being widely held with all the fixity of Revealed Religion, that WHEN THE CURRENT REVISION IS COMPLETE, THE SYSTEM WILL BE PERFECT Alternatively: PERFECTION CAN BE ACHIEVED ON THE DAY AFTER THE FINAL DEADLINE Needless to say, this idea, no matter how elegantly formulated, remains a Delusion. The truth of the matter is summarized inPerfectionist’s Paradox: IN DEALING WITH LARGE SYSTEMS, THE STRIVING FOR PERFECTION IS A SERIOUS IMPERFECTION\n\n\nIF IT’S WORTH DOING AT ALL, IT’S WORTH DOING POORLY\n\n\nBut even today, one still occasionally hears a slogan, asserted as if it were a genuine Systems-Axiom, to the effect that: IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION, YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM. —Catchy but specious. The correct form of the Theorem is as follows: THE SOLUTION IS OFTEN PART OF THE PROBLEM\n\n\nWe have encountered this process before. It is our old friend, Positive Feedback. IF THINGS SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE EVEN FASTER THAN USUAL, CONSIDER THAT THE REMEDY MAY BE AT FAULT —or, more succinctly: STAY OUT OF THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK TRAP This phenomenon will be referred to as the Nasal Spray Effect in tribute to the millions of hay fever and “sinus” sufferers the world over who use nasal sprays to shrink their stuffy noses, only to discover that the rebound stuffiness that occurs when the spray wears off is worse than the original stuffiness.\n\n\nESCALATING THE WRONG SOLUTION DOES NOT IMPROVE THE OUTCOME —or more briefly, that the Nasal Spray Effect cannot be cured by using more nasal spray.\n\n\nIF THINGS ARE ACTING VERY STRANGELY, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY BE IN A FEEDBACK SITUATION\n\n\nFurthermore, an uncanny element of Paradox is prominent in the few examples so far reported. Thus, the long survival of the British Monarchy is probably attributable to the fact that the King reignsbut does notrule\n\n\nWhat has been said so far could be summarized in one deceptively simple Rule of Thumb: IF YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, CHANGE THE FRAME—IT COMES TO THE SAME THING But a word of warning is in order. The novice Reframer, having discovered the hammer, so to speak, is likely to consider that almost everything needs hammering. This tendency should be resisted. We do not deny that occasionally one may encounter—or, even more happily, initiate—a successful Reframing. But we insist resolutely upon the Reality Principle, which states that such occurrences are the exception, not the rule. Tempered, moderate pessimism is the hallmark of the seasoned Systems-student.\n\n\nFundamental Theorem: NEW SYSTEMS GENERATE NEW PROBLEMS.

It describes how it was first implemented, why it worked, and how the different actors behaved about the new innovation. The container shaped international trade more than anything else in the 20th century, and this is the story of how it came to be.\n🎨 Impressions\nI got very surprised about how many things had to go right for the container to be implemented. On one side, it looked like an inevitable solution to the problem of unloading cargo, as that was one of the biggest challenges before the introduction of the container. The container basically exterminated the longshoremen from the harbors, and the remaining stevedores went from being hired for a day’s work to beome a smaller group of professionals using cranes to unload cargo.\nA stevedore is one that takes contracts to load or unload a vessel. A head foreman, however, is sometimes called a stevedore. The longshoreman is the workman hired to handle the cargo under the direction of a foreman.\nHow I Discovered It\nI discovered it when I was browsing through books on the maritime industry and how logistics work.\nWho Should Read It?\nPeople who take particular interest in logistics and the history of logistics.\n☘️ How the Book Changed Me\nI was particularly astonished by the fact that the longshoremen union was such a powerful force in America in the 50s and 60s. Many of them got good pensions due to negotiations with the shipping industry. Furthermore, I was super surprised to see how much governmental regulation there was in the logistics sector, with governmental departments dictating prices for trucking, trains, etc.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n“It is better to assume that moving goods is essentially costless than to assume that moving goods is an important component of the production process.” Before the container, such a statement was unimaginable.\nNdearly 3,000 U.S. merchant ships survived and were available for merchant service by 1946. Among them were more than 2,400 of the Liberty Ships that U.S. shipyards had turned out between 1941 and 1945. Designed as convoy vessels and built in fewer than 70 days from prefabricated parts, the Liberty Ships were very slow and cheap enough to be expendable\nThe significant cost item was the wages of longshore gangs, which could eat up half the total expense of an ocean voyage.\n“60 to 75 percent of the cost of transporting cargo by sea is accounted for by what takes place while the ship is at the dock and not by steaming time,” two analysts concluded in 1959.\nAmong Portland longshoremen, the most common paternal occupation was longshoreman. In Antwerp, 58 percent of dockworkers were the sons of dock-workers. The ratio in Manchester was three-quarters, and many of the rest had entered the docks with the help of their in-laws after marrying a dockworker’s daughter.\nT]he dockers are such difficult people, just the fathers and the sons, the uncles and nephews. So like the House of Lords, hereditary and no intelligence required.”\nAn eleven-nation study found that dockworkers, along with miners and seafarers, lost more workdays to labor disputes than any other professions.\nThis history of antagonistic labor-management relations gave rise to two problems that plagued the shipping industry around the world. One was theft. Theft had always been a problem on the waterfront, and the growth of trade in higher-value products after World War II caused it to reach epidemic proportions.\nThe second problem arising from dockworkers’ intense suspicion of employers was resistance to anything that might eliminate jobs.\nAfter four months of hearings in 1931, the commission ruled weight-based rates illegal. Although it found the container to be “a commendable piece of equipment,” the commission said that the railroads could not charge less to carry a container than to carry the equivalent weight of the most expensive commodity inside the container. With that ruling, containers no longer made economic sense on the rails.\nThe entire merchant fleet had been commandeered by the government when the United States entered the war, and many ships did not revert to private control until July 1947, almost two years after the war ended.\nLoading loose cargo on a medium-size cargo ship cost $5.83 per ton in 1956. McLean’s experts pegged the cost of loading the Ideal-X at 15.8 cents per ton. With numbers like that, the container seemed to have a future.\nMalcom McLean’s fundamental insight, commonplace today but quite radical in the 1950s, was that the shipping industry’s business was moving cargo, not sailing ships.\nIt offered to eliminate one or two longshoremen from each gang. In return, it sought a six-hour workday and a requirement that every container, whatever its origin, be “stripped and stuffed”—that is, emptied and then reloaded—by ILA members on the pier. Stripping and stuffing, of course, were entirely make-work, and would have eliminated any cost savings from containerization.\nThe United States Maritime Administration decided in 1958 to put an end to this incipient anarchy. Marad, as it was known, was an obscure government agency, but it held enormous power over the maritime industry.\nAs Matson executive vice president Norman Scott explained, “In the economics of transportation, there is no magic in mathematical symmetry.”\nPiggyback, like almost every innovation in transportation during that era, faced a very large obstacle: the Interstate Commerce Commission.\nThe costliest merchant ships ever built were also the thirstiest, each burning five hundred tons of fuel per day. At full speed, they consumed three times as much fuel per container as competitors’ vessels.\nWhen American President Lines studied the matter a few years later, it concluded that freight rates from Asia to North America had fallen 40 to 60 percent because of the container.\nIn 2004, nonfarm inventories in the United States were about 1 trillion lower than they would have been had they stayed at the level of the 1980s, relative to sales. Assume that the money needed to finance those inventories would have to be borrowed at 8 or 9 percent, and inventory reductions are saving U.S. businesses 80-$90 billion per year.\nConversely, African countries with inefficient ports and little containership service are at such a transport-cost disadvantage that even rock-bottom labor costs will not attract investment in manufacturing.\nWhen New York longshore leader Teddy Gleason warned in 1959 that the container would eliminate 30 percent of his union’s jobs in New York, he was simply wrong: between 1963 and 1976, longshore hours worked in New York City fell by three-quarters.\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/The-Fifth-Discipline":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/The-Fifth-Discipline","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/The Fifth Discipline.md","title":"The Fifth Discipline","links":["Science/Systems/Thinking-in-Systems","Science/Systems/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","system-thinking","organizations","work","working","networking","processes"],"content":"The Fifth Discipline\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about apporaching the difficulties of organizations and businesses using system thinking. It goes through the issues at hand, and how some problems are related to the system in itself rather than people. The goal is to create organizations that learn to work in this context.\n🎨 Impressions\nThis book is very similar to the other books I read on system thinking.  It draws upon the penultimate book on system thinking Thinking in Systems\nThe below sentence resonated with me.\nA “political environment” is one in which “who” is more important than “what.” ’ If the boss proposes an idea, the idea gets taken seriously. If someone else proposes a new idea, it is ignored.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIn most companies that fail, there is abundant evidence in advance that the firm is in trouble. This evidence goes unheeded, however, even when individual managers are aware of it.\n\n\n“Most management teams break down under pressure,” writes Harvard’s Chris Argyris—a longtime student of learning in management teams. “The team may function quite well with routine issues. But when they confront complex issues that may be embarrassing or threatening, the ‘teamness’ seems to go to pot.”\n\n\nIn The March of Folly, Barbara Tuchman traces the history of devastating large-scale policies “pursued contrary to ultimate self-interest,”\n\n\nReading between the lines of Tuchman’s writing, you can see that the fourteenth-century Valois monarchs of France. suffered from “I am my position” when they devalued currency, they literally didn’t realize they were driving the new French middle class toward insurrection.\n\n\nIn the mid-1700s Britain had a bad case of boiled frog. The British went through “a full decade,” wrote Tuchman, “of mounting conflict with the [American] colonies without any [British official] sending a representative, much less a minister, across the Atlantic … to find out what was endangering the relationship …” By 1776, the start of the American Revolution, the relationship was irrevocably endangered.\n\n\nDifferent people in the same structure tend to produce qualitatively similar results. When there are problems, or performance fails to live up to what is intended, it is easy to find someone or something to blame. But, more often than we realize, systems cause their own crises, not external forces or individuals’ mistakes.\n\n\nLeverage Often Comes from New Ways of Thinking. In human systems, people often have potential leverage that they do not exercise because they focus only on their own decisions and ignore how their decisions affect others.\n\n\nIn other words, the majority of players in the game, many of them experienced managers, do much worse than if they simply placed orders equal to the orders they receive. In trying to correct the imbalances that result from “doing nothing,” most players make matters worse, in many cases dramatically worse.\n\n\nOn the other hand, about 25 percent of the players score better than the “no strategy” strategy, and about 10 percent score very much better. In other words, success is possible. But it requires a shift of view for most players.\n\n\nWhen your supplier can’t get you the beer you want as quickly as normal, the worst thing you can do is order more beer. Yet, that is exactly what many players do. It takes discipline to contain the overwhelming urge to order more when backlogs are building and your customers are screaming. But, without that discipline, you and everyone else will suffer.\n\n\nThe reason that structural explanations are so important is that only they address the underlying causes of behavior at a level that patterns of behavior can be changed. Structure produces behavior, and changing underlying structures can produce different patterns of behavior. In this sense, structural explanations are inherently generative. Moreover, since structure in human systems includes the “operating policies” of the decision makers in the system, redesigning our own decision making redesigns the system structure.\n\n\nThe harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.\n\n\nIn George Orwell’s Animal Farm, the horse Boxer always had the same answer to any difficulty: “I will work harder,” he said. At first, his well-intentioned diligence inspired everyone, but gradually, his hard work began to backfire in subtle ways. The harder he worked, the more work there was to do. What he didn’t know was that the pigs who managed the farm were actually manipulating them all for their own profit. Boxer’s diligence actually helped to keep the other animals from seeing what the pigs were doing. Systems thinking has a name for this phenomenon: “Compensating feedback”: when well-intentioned interventions call forth responses from the system that offset the benefits of the intervention. We all know what it feels like to be facing compensating feedback—the harder you push, the harder the system pushes back; the more effort you expend trying to improve matters, the more effort seems to be required.\n\n\nFor most American business people the best rate of growth is fast, faster, fastest. Yet, virtually all natural systems, from ecosystems to animals to organizations, have intrinsically optimal rates of growth. The optimal rate is far less than the fastest possible growth. When growth becomes excessive—as it does in cancer—the system itself will seek to compensate by slowing down; perhaps putting the organization’s survival at risk in the process.\n\n\nCause and effect are not closely related in time and space. Underlying all of the above problems is a fundamental characteristic of complex human systems: “cause” and “effect” are not close in time and space. By “effects,” I mean the obvious symptoms that indicate that there are problems—drug abuse, unemployment, starving children, falling orders, and sagging profits. By “cause” I mean the interaction of the underlying system that is most responsible for generating the symptoms, and which, if recognized, could lead to changes producing lasting improvement\n\n\nThe key principle, called the “principle of the system boundary,” is that the interactions that must be examined are those most important to the issue at hand, regardless of parochial organizational boundaries.\n\n\nWhat makes this principle difficult to practice is the way organizations are designed to keep people from seeing important interactions. One obvious way is by enforcing rigid internal divisions that inhibit inquiry across divisional boundaries, such as those that grow up between marketing, manufacturing, and research. Another is by “leaving” problems behind us, for someone else to clean up.\n\n\nSystems thinking is a discipline for seeing wholes. It is a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static “snapshots.” It is a set of general principles—distilled over the course of the twentieth century, spanning fields as diverse as the physical and social sciences, engineering, and management\n\n\n*The essence of the discipline of systems thinking lies in a shift of mind:\n\nSeeing interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect chains\nSeeing processes of change rather than snapshots\n\n\n\nThe practice of systems thinking starts with understanding a simple concept called “feedback” that shows how actions can reinforce or counteract (balance) each other. It builds to learning to recognize types of “structures” that recur again and again: the arms race is a generic or archetypal pattern of escalation, at its heart no different from turf warfare between two street gangs, the demise of a marriage, or the advertising battles of two consumer goods companies fighting for market share.\n\n\nAll ideas in the language of systems thinking are built up from these elements, just as English sentences are built up from nouns and verbs. Once we have learned the building blocks, we can begin constructing stories: the systems archetypes of the next chapter. REINFORCING FEEDBACK: DISCOVERING HOW SMALL CHANGES CAN GROW\n\n\nPsychologist Robert Merton first identified this phenomenon as the “self-fulfilling prophecy.” It is also known as the “Pygmalion effect,” after the famous George Bernard Shaw play (later to become My Fair Lady). Shaw in turn had taken his title from Pygmalion, a character in Greek and Roman mythology, who believed so strongly in the beauty of the statue he had carved that it came to life.\n\n\nPygmalion effects have been shown to operate in countless situations. An example occurs in schools, where a teacher’s opinion of a student influences the behavior of that student.\n\n\nIn business, we know that “momentum is everything,” in building confidence in a new product or within a fledgling organization.\n\n\nThe feeling, as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts put it, of needing “all the running you can do to keep in the same place,” is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby.\n\n\nLeaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an implicit system goal. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is doomed to failure.\n\n\n“One of the highest leverage points for improving system performance,” says Ray Stata, CEO of Analog Devices, “is the minimization of system delays.”\n\n\n“The way leading companies manage time,” says George Stalk, vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, “—in production, in new product development, in sales and distribution—represents the most powerful new source of competitive disadvantage.”\n\n\nUnrecognized delays can also lead to instability and breakdown, especially when they are long.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT PRINCIPLE: Don’t push growth; remove the factors limiting growth. WHERE IT IS FOUND!\n\n\nBut the more successful the quality circles become, the more threatening they become to the traditional distribution of political power in the firm. Union leaders begin to fear that the new openness will break down traditional adversarial relations between workers and management, thereby undermining union leaders’ ability to influence workers. They begin to undermine the quality circle activity by playing on workers’ apprehensions about being manipulated and “snowed” by managers: “Be careful; if you keep coming up with cost saving improvements on the production line, your job will be the next to go.”\n\n\nTypically, most people react to limits to growth situations by trying to push hard: if you can’t break your bad habit, become more diligent in monitoring your own behavior; if your relationship is having problems, spend more time together or work harder to make the relationship work; if staff are unhappy, keep promoting junior staff to make them happy; if the flow of new products is slowing down, start more new product initiatives to offset the problems with the ones that are bogged down; or advocate quality circle more strongly.\n\n\nBeware the symptomatic solution. Solutions that address only the symptoms of a problem, not fundamental causes, tend to have short-term benefits at best. In the long term, the problem resurfaces and there is increased pressure for symptomatic response. Meanwhile, the capability for fundamental solutions can atrophy.\n\n\nThese are the generic dynamics of addiction. In fact, almost all forms of addiction have shifting the burden structures underlying them. All involve opting for symptomatic solutions, the gradual atrophy of the ability to focus on fundamental solutions, and the increasing reliance on symptomatic solutions. By this definition, organizations and entire societies are subject to addiction as much as are individuals.\n\n\nThe primary insights in shifting the burden will come from (1) distinguishing different types of solutions; (2) seeing how reliance on symptomatic solutions can reinforce further reliance.\n\n\nTo me, bottom line of systems thinking is leverage—seeing where actions and changes in structures can lead to significant, enduring improvements.\n\n\nSystems thinking finds it greatest benefits in helping us distinguish high- from low-leverage changes in highly complex situations. In effect, the art of systems thinking lies in seeing through complexity to the underlying structures generating change. Systems thinking does not mean ignoring complexity. Rather, it means organizing complexity into a coherent story that illuminates the causes of problems and how they can be remedied in enduring ways.\n\n\nYankelovich uses the word “sacred” in the sociological not religious sense: “People or objects are sacred in the sociological sense when, apart from what instrumental use they serve, they are valued for themselves.”\n\n\nThe Koran ends with the phrase, “What a tragedy that man must die before he wakes up.”\n\n\nA useful starting exercise for learning how to focus more clearly on desired results is to take any particular goal or aspect of your vision. First imagine that that goal is fully realized. Then ask yourself the question, “If I actually had this, what would it get me?” What\n\n\nThe core leadership strategy is simple: be a model. Commit yourself to your own personal mastery. Talking about personal mastery may open people’s minds somewhat, but actions always speak louder than words. There’s nothing more powerful you can do to encourage others in their quest for personal mastery than to be serious in your own quest.\n\n\nAs Albert Einstein once wrote, “Our theories determine what we measure.” For years, physicists ran experiments that contradicted classical physics, yet no one “saw” the data that these experiments eventually provided, leading to the revolutionary theories—quantum mechanics\nNote: This is in resemblance to the book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n\n\nThe problems with mental models lie not in whether they are right or wrong—by definition, all models are simplifications. The problems with mental models arise when the models are tacit—when they exist below the level of awareness.\n\n\nInstitutionalizing reflection and surfacing mental models require mechanisms that make these practices unavoidable. Two approaches that have emerged to date involve recasting traditional planning as learning and establishing “internal boards of directors” to bring senior management and local management together regularly to challenge and expand the thinking behind local decision making.\n\n\n*HANOVER’S CREDO ON MENTAL MODELS\n\nThe effectiveness of a leader is related to the continual improvement of the leader’s mental models.\n Don’t impose a favored mental model on people. Mental models should lead to self-concluding decisions to work their best.\n Self-concluding decisions result in deeper convictions and more effective implementation.\nBetter mental models enable owners to adjust to changes in environment or circumstance.\nInternal board members rarely need to make direct decisions. Instead, their role is to help the General Manager by testing or adding to the GMs mental model.\nMultiple mental models bring multiple perspectives to bear.\nGroups add dynamics and knowledge beyond what one person can do alone.\nThe goal is not congruency among the group.\nWhen the process works it leads to congruency.\nLeaders’ worth is measured by their contribution to others’ mental models.\n\n\n\nSkills of reflection concern slowing down our own thinking processes so that we can become more/aware of how we form our mental models and the ways they influence our actions. Inquiry skills concern how we operate in face-to-face (interactions with others, especially in dealing with complex and conflictual issues.\n\n\nMost managers are trained to be advocates. In fact, in many companies, what it means to be a competent manager is to be able to solve problems—to figure out what needs to be done, and enlist whatever support is needed to get it done. Individuals became successful in part because of their abilities to debate forcefully and influence others. Inquiry skills, meanwhile, go unrecognized and unrewarded. However, as managers rise to senior positions, they confront issues more complex and diverse than their personal experience. Suddenly, they need to tap insights from other people. They need to learn. Now the manager’s advocacy skills become counterproductive; they can close us off from actually learning from one another. What is needed is blending advocacy and inquiry to promote collaborative learning\n\n\nAnother way to say this is “reciprocal inquiry.” By this we mean that everyone makes his or her thinking explicit and subject to public examination. This creates an atmosphere of genuine vulnerability.\n\n\nIf managers “believe” their world views are facts rather than sets of assumptions, they will not be open to challenging those world views.\n\n\nSystems thinking is equally important to working with mental models effectively. Contemporary research shows that most of our mental models are systematically flawed. They miss critical feedback relationships, misjudge time delays, and often focus on variables that are visible or salient, not necessarily high leverage.\n\n\nLate in his career, the psychologist Abraham Maslow studied high-performing teams. One of their most striking characteristics was shared vision and purpose. Maslow observed that in exceptional’ teams the task was no longer separate from the self… but rather he identified with this task so strongly that you couldn’t define his real self without including that task.6\n\n\nAs one highly successful CEO expressed it: “My job, fundamentally, is listening to what the organization is trying to say, and then making sure that it is forcefully articulated.”\n\n\nYet, there is a world of difference between compliance and commitment. The committed person brings an energy, passion, and excitement that cannot be generated if you are only compliant, even genuinely compliant. The committed person doesn’t play by the “rules of the game.” He is responsible for the game. If the rules of the game stand in the way of achieving the vision, he will find ways to change the rules.\n\n\nThey told me of a stage in their project where certain critical software was several months behind schedule. The three engineers responsible came into the office one evening and left the next morning. By all accounts they accomplished two to three months of work that evening—and no one could explain how. These are not the feats of compliance\n\n\nSeveral “limits to growth” structures can come into play to arrest the building of momentum behind a new vision. Understanding these structures can help considerably in sustaining the “visioning process.”\n\n\nIn this case, the leverage must lie in either in finding ways to focus less time and effort on fighting crises and managing current reality, or to break off those pursuing the new vision from those responsible for handling “current reality.” In many ways, this is the strategy of “skunk works,” small groups that quietly pursue new ideas out of the organizational mainstream. While this approach is often necessary, it is difficult to avoid fostering two polar extreme “camps” that no longer can support one another.\n\n\nIndividuals do not sacrifice their personal interests to the larger team vision; rather, the shared vision becomes an extension of their personal visions. In fact, alignment is the necessary condition before empowering the individual will empower the whole team.\n\n\n“We are not trying to win in a dialogue. We all win if we are doing it right.” In dialogue, individuals gain insights that simply could not be achieved individually. “A new kind of mind begins to come into being which is based on the development of a common meaning\n\n\n“The purpose of dialogue,” Bohm suggests, “is to reveal the incoherence in our thought.” There are three types of incoherence. “Thought denies that it is participative.” Thought stops tracking reality and “just goes, like a program.” And thought establishes its own standard of reference for fixing problems, problems which it contributed to creating in the first\n\n\n“The purpose of dialogue,” Bohm suggests, “is to reveal the incoherence in our thought.” There are three types of incoherence. “Thought denies that it is participative.” Thought stops tracking reality and “just goes, like a program.” And thought establishes its own standard of reference for fixing problems, problems which it contributed to creating in the first place.\n\n\nDefensive routines form a sort of protective shell around our deepest assumptions, defending us against pain, but also keeping us from learning about the causes of the pain.\n\n\nIf anything, team skills are more challenging to develop than individual skills. This is why learning teams need “practice fields,” ways to practice together so that they can develop their collective learning skills.\n\n\nThe tools of systems thinking are also important because virtually all the prime tasks of management teams—developing strategy, shaping visions, designing policy and organizational structures—involve wrestling with enormous complexity. Furthermore, this complexity does not “stay put.” Each situation is in a continual state of flux.\n\n\nPerhaps the single greatest liability of management teams is that they confront these complex, dynamic realities with a language designed for simple, static problems.\n\n\n“I moved to a town with a paper mill once,” says Hanover’s Bill O’Brien, “and when we drove into town we almost drove right out again. Two weeks later, we had all gotten used to the smell and didn’t notice it. Organizational politics is such a perversion of truth and honesty that most organizations reek with its odor. Yet, most of us so take it for granted that we don’t even notice it.”\n\n\nA “political environment” is one in which “who” is more important than “what.” ’ If the boss proposes an idea, the idea gets taken seriously. If someone else proposes a new idea, it is ignored.\n\n\nThere are always “winners” and “losers,” people who are building their power and people who are losing power. Power is concentrated and it is wielded arbitrarily. One person can determine another’s fate, and there is no recourse to that determination. The wielding of arbitrary power over others is the essence of authoritarianism—so, in this sense, a political environment is an authoritarian environment, even if those possessing the power are not in the official positions of authority.\n\n\nChallenging the grip of internal politics and game playing starts with building shared vision. Without a genuine sense of common vision and values there is nothing to motivate people beyond self-interest.\n\n\nReflective openness is based on skills, not just good intentions. There are the skills of reflection and inquiry, first presented in the mental models\n\n\nReflective openness lives in the attitude, “I may be wrong and the other person may be right.” It involves not just examining our own ideas, but mutually examining others’ thinking.\n\n\nThe end result is the curious phenomenon of “open closedness,” when everyone feels he has a right to air views, yet no one really listens and reflects. “Talking at” one other substitutes for genuine communication and dialogue.\n\n\nFor example, being able to distinguish “facts” (direct observations) from generalizations based on those facts would have helped the executives with the “officer in the barrel.”\n\n\nNothing undermines openness more surely than certainty. Once we feel as if we have “the answer,” all motivation to question our thinking disappears. But the discipline of systems thinking shows that there simply is “no right answer” when dealing with complexity. For this reason, openness and systems thinking are closely linked.\n\n\nLife comes to us whole. It is only the analytic lens we impose that makes it seem as if problems can be isolated and solved. When we forget that it is “only a lens,” we lose the spirit of openness.\n\n\nThat there are two fundamentally different types of problems: “convergent problems” and “divergent problems.”6\n\n\nConvergent problems have a solution: “the more intelligently you study them, the more the answers converge.” Divergent problems have no “correct” solution. The more they are studied by people with knowledge and intelligence the more they “come up with answers which contradict one another.” The difficulty lies not with the experts, but in the nature of the problem itself. If\n\n\nThis is why learning organizations will, increasingly, be “localized” organizations, extending the maximum degree of authority and power as far from the “top” or corporate center as possible. Local-ness means moving decisions down the organizational hierarchy; designing business units where, to the greatest degree possible, local decision makers confront the full range of issues and dilemmas intrinsic in growing and sustaining any business enterprise. Local-ness means unleashing people’s commitment by giving them the freedom to act, to try out their own ideas and be responsible for\n\n\nThis is why learning organizations will, increasingly, be “localized” organizations, extending the maximum degree of authority and power as far from the “top” or corporate center as possible. Local-ness means moving decisions down the organizational hierarchy; designing business units where, to the greatest degree possible, local decision makers confront the full range of issues and dilemmas intrinsic in growing and sustaining any business enterprise. Local-ness means unleashing people’s commitment by giving them the freedom to act, to try out their own ideas and be responsible for producing results.\n\n\n“In the traditional hierarchical organization, the top thinks and the local acts. In a learning organization, you have to merge thinking and acting in every individual.”\n\n\nThe ambivalence of many senior managers to giving over greater authority and control of decision making is, in part, rooted in fear of loss. Will senior or corporate management become unneeded or somehow less important—mere window dressing in the locally controlled organization? This fear is unfortunate because it keeps many senior managers from discovering their new role in a locally controlled organization: responsibility for continually enhancing the organization’s capacity for learning. One of the big problems plaguing organizations that are becoming more localized is that corporate management, paralyzed by the fear of what they might lose, are neglecting this very important new role.\n\n\nThe illusion of being in control can appear quite real. In hierarchical organizations, leaders give orders and others follow. But giving orders is not the same as being in control. Power may be concentrated at the top but having the power of unilateral decision making is not the same as being able to achieve one’s objectives. Authority figures may be treated deferentially, lavished with the highest salaries and other privileges of rank, but that does not mean that they actually exercise control commensurate with their apparent importance.\n\n\nBecause of the lingering belief that you can control decisions from the top, many corporations vacillate between localizing and centralizing. When business goes well, decisions are made more and more locally. When business begins to founder, the first instincts are to return control to central management. This “on again/off again” pattern of decision making testifies to the deep lack of confidence which senior managers have in local decision makers.\n\n\nThose of us in top management often say to each other that we had more fun running a J&amp;J company than anything since. If you are having as much fun running a big corporation as you did running a piece of it, then you are probably interfering too much with the people who really make it happen.”\n\n\nThe tragedy of the Sahel was rooted in steady growth of population and herd sizes from the 1920s to the 1970s. The growth accelerated from 1955 to 1965 due to unusually heavy rainfalls and assistance from international aid organizations who financed numerous deep wells. Each herdsman on the Sahel had incentives to expand his herd of zebu, both for economic gain and social status. As long as the common grazing lands were large enough to support these new, larger herds, there were no problems. But in the early 1960s, overgrazing began to occur. Eventually rangeland vegetation grew sparser. The sparser the vegetation, the more overgrazing, until it got to the point where the cattle consumed more foliage than the ranges could generate. The desertification reinforced itself as decreases in plant cover allowed wind and rain to erode the soil. Less vegetation was produced, which got overgrazed more severely to support the herds, leading to further desertification. The vicious spiral continued until disaster struck in the form of a series of droughts in the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1970s, 50 to 80 percent of the livestock was dead and much of the population of the Sahel was destitute.”\n\n\nCorporations have many depletable “commons” to share: financial capital, productive capital, technology, community reputation, good will of customers, good will and support of suppliers, and morale and competence of employees toAname just a few. When a company decentralizes, local divisions conipete with each other for those limited resources.\n\n\nOne day he was summoned to the office of Chairman General Robert Wood Johnson. One of Burke’s first product ideas, a children’s chest rub, had failed dismally. When Burke walked in Johnson asked, “Are you the one who just cost us all that money?” Burke nodded. The general said/ “Well, I just want to congratulate you. If you are making mistakes, that means you are making decisions and taking risks. And we won’t grow unless you take risks.”\n\n\nLearning organizations practice forgiveness because, as Cray Research’s CEO John Rollwagen says, “Making the mistake is punishment enough.”\n\n\n“Captain Asoh, in your own words, can you tell us how you managed to land that DC-8 stretch jet two and a half miles out in San Francisco Bay in perfect compass line with the runway?” Asoh’s response, though never recorded in the official NTSB minutes, has gone down in airline folklore: “As you Americans say, Asoh fuck up.” The captain took full responsibility for the error. His crew, bound by the orders of Japanese decorum that prohibit criticizing a superior, had sat silently as Asoh landed.\n\n\nShe said that when a person in a Japanese firm sits quietly, no one will come and interrupt. It is assumed that the person is thinking. On the other hand, when the person is up and moving about, coworkers feel free to interrupt. “Isn’t it interesting,” she said, “that it is exactly the opposite in American firms? In America, we assume that when a person is sitting quietly they aren’t doing anything very important.”\n\n\nFor instance, O’Brien simply doesn’t schedule short meetings. “If it isn’t a subject that is worthy of an hour, it shouldn’t be on my calendar.”\n\n\nFor example, one Ann Arbor Michigan study found that 36 percent of the children of executives undergo treatment for psychiatric or drug abuse each year, vs. 15 percent of children of non-executives in the same companies.\n\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where less time at home is leading to poorer family relationships, there can be strong psychological pressures to avoid family problems still further.\n\n\n“an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay.” In the learning organization, the boundaries between what is personal and what is organizational are intentionally blurred. Learning organizations enter into a new compact, or “covenant” as Max de Pree puts it, with their members. The essence of this compact is the organization’s commitment to support the full development of each employee, and the person’s reciprocal commitment to the organization\n\n\nShell’s Arie de Geus says that organizational learning occurs in three ways: through teaching, through “changing the rules of the game” (such as through openness and localness), and through play.\n\n\nRepresentation is the tool for adaptation. Simulation is the tool for creating.\n\n\nThe “scientific management” revolution of Frederick Taylor took the traditional division of labor, between workers and managers, and gave us the “thinkers” and the “doers.” The doers were basically prohibited from thinking. I believe our fundamental challenge is tapping the intellectual capacity of people at all levels, both as individuals and as groups.\n\n\nWhen Lyndon Johnson first became President, his “Great Society” inspired full-hearted support throughout the country, despite the tragedy which brought him into office. Johnson was a master enroller, with the patience to take Congress through his proposed legislation one bill at a time, with stunning results; out of ninety-one proposals, Congress only rejected two. His enrollment of the public was no less stunning: “His goals had been the country’s goals,” wrote historian William Manchester. But the results of Johnson’s leadership eventually proved disappointing, in part, because Johnson could not keep his commitment to the truth. When he was told that the United States could not afford the Great Society and the Vietnam War at the same time, he began systematically lying about the costs of the war. “If I [tell Congress] about the cost of the war,” he told his advisers, according to Manchester, “old [Senator] Wilbur Mills will sit down there and he’ll thank me kindly and send me back my Great Society.” Gradually Johnson began to isolate himself from criticism, even from his advisers; soon, many of the members of his Cabinet resigned. Eventually, Johnson’s chain of lies found its way to public attention and became the “credibility gap”—so christened by the New York Herald Tribune in 1965. His leadership was effectively over—to the point where he could not run for reelection in 1968.\n\n\nSystems thinking teaches that there are two types of complexity— the “detail complexity” of many variables and the “dynamic complexity” when “cause and effect” are not close in time and space and obvious interventions do not produce expected outcomes.\n\n\nBut what about detail complexity? What about the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feedback processes in any real managerial situation, all operating simultaneously? How can we possibly cope with such complexity? What good is systems thinking, anyhow, if it only teaches us to identify a few feedback processes amid this welter of activity\n\n\nSystems perspective is that this enormous detail complexity renders all rational explanations inherently incomplete. Human systems are infinitely complex. “You can never figure it out,” I suggested— because it’s “un-figure-out-able.” Nonetheless, we can enhance our mastery of complexity.\n\n\nHowever, if we begin to master a systemic language, all this starts to change. The subconscious is subtly retrained to structure data in circles instead of straight\n\n\nHowever, if we begin to master a systemic language, all this starts to change. The subconscious is subtly retrained to structure data in circles instead of straight lines. We find that we “see” feedback processes and systems archetypes everywhere. A new framework for thinking becomes embedded.\n\n\n“When this switch is thrown subconsciously, you become a systems thinker ever thereafter. Reality is automatically seen systemically as well as linearly (there still are lots of problems for which a linear perspective is perfectly adequate). Alternatives that are impossible to see linearly are surfaced by the subconscious as proposed solutions. Solutions that were outside of our ‘feasible set’ become part of our feasible set. ‘Systemic’ becomes a way of thinking (almost a way of being) and not just a problem solving methodology.”\n\n\n*Each of the five learning disciplines can be thought of on three distinct levels:\n\n practices: what you do\nprinciples: guiding ideas and insights\nessences: the state of being of those with high levels of mastery in the discipline\n\n\n\nManagement Principles\n\n\nManagement Principle: Don’t push on the reinforcing (growth) process, remove (or weaken) the source of limitation.\n\n\n***Management Principle: *Focus on the fundamental solution. If symptomatic solution is imperative (because of delays in fundamental solution), use it to gain time while working on the fundamental solution.\n\n\n***Management Principle: *“Teach people to fish, rather than giving them fish.” Focus on enhancing the capabilities of the “host system” to solve its own problems. If outside help is needed, “helpers” should be strictly limited to a one-time intervention (and everyone knows this in advance) or be able to help people develop their own skills, resources, and infrastructure to be more capable in the future.\n\n\nManagement Principle: Look for a way for both sides to “win,” or to achieve their objectives. In many instances, one side can unilaterally reverse the vicious spiral by taking overtly aggressive “peaceful” actions that cause the other to feel less threatened.\n\n\nManagement Principle: Look for the overarching goal for balanced achievement of both choices. In some cases, break or weaken the coupling between SUCCESS TO THE SUCCESSFUL Structure: i i the two, so that they do not compete for the same limited resource (this is desirable in cases where the coupling is inadvertent and creates an unhealthy competition for resources).\n\n\nManagement Principle: Manage the “commons,” either through educating everyone and creating forms of self-regulation and peer pressure, or through an official regulating mechanism, ideally designed by participants.\n\n\nManagement Principle: Maintain focus on the long term. Disregard short-term “fx,” if feasible, or use it only to “buy time” while working on long-term remedy.\n\n\nManagement Principle: If there is a genuine potential for growth, build capacity in advance of demand, as a strategy for creating demand. Hold the vision, especially as regards assessing key performance standards and evaluating whether the capacity to meet potential demand is adequate.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.md","title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","links":[],"tags":["science","history","scientific-method","revolution","books","non-fiction"],"content":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book examines what constitutes a “scientific revolution”.

It covers what the background for each was and tries to find some common criteria for a scientific revolution.\n🎨 Impressions\nI liked the book, it was short and to the point, although sometimes a bit dull.\nI think that it is interesting that the author notes multiple incidents where the old theory is basically meeting so many inconsistencies that\nIt might be interesting for those who are interested in how things evolve. To quote the not-so-great Vladimir Lenin, “There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen”.\nIt is the inconsistencies that drive scientific revolutions. It is a fact that more and more things in the old theories are off, and more and more things start to look weird. Furthermore, more and more complexity is added to the current theory until it becomes cumbersome enough that a new one is more or less destined to arrive.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\n“Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.”\n\n\nHelmholtz, in the nineteenth, encountered strong resistance from physiologists to the notion that physical experimentation could illuminate their field.\n\n\nWhat Lavoisier announced in his papers from 1777 on was not so much the discovery of oxygen as the oxygen theory of combustion. That theory was the keystone for a reformulation of chemistry so vast that it is usually called the chemical revolution.\n\n\nX-rays, however, were greeted not only with surprise but with shock. Lord Kelvin at first pronounced them an elaborate hoax.\n\n\nCopernicus’ co-worker, Domenico da Novara, held that no system so cumbersome and inaccurate as the Ptolemaic had become could possibly be true of nature. And Copernicus himself wrote in the Preface to the De Revolutionibus that the astronomical tradition he inherited had finally created only a monster.\n\n\n“A science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost.”\n\n\nA very different approach to this whole network of problems has been developed by Karl R. Popper, who denies the existence of any verification procedures at all. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of falsification, i.e., of the test that, because its outcome is negative, necessitates the rejection of an established theory.\n\n\nIn the case of the wave theory, one main source of professional conversions was even more dramatic. French resistance collapsed suddenly and relatively completely when Fresnel was able to demonstrate the existence of a white spot at the center of the shadow of a circular disk. That was an effect that not even he had anticipated but that Poisson, initially one of his opponents, had shown to be a necessary if absurd consequence of Fresnel’s theory.\n\n\nA paradigm is what the members of a scientific community share, and, conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking-in-Systems":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking-in-Systems","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/Systems/Thinking in Systems.md","title":"Thinking in Systems","links":[],"tags":["books","non-fiction","productivity","science","engineering","engineering/management","system-thinking","political-science"],"content":"Thinking in Systems\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about understanding and conveying how the system works and how you can use systems thinking to understand the world differently. Systems have mechanisms that govern their behavior, and system thinking allows you to model how the system behaves when manipulating it.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was a good book, precise and understandable. This was how engineers thought since I remember very well how we used to model things the same way in school. This book shows how you can apply this type of mental modelling to many different use cases.\nThis is important, so I am pleased about it.\nOne thing I appreciated in the book was that they say that everything we perceive about the world is a model, language, etc. The models are good, but they need to depict the world accurately. When I am reading The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins, I think that since our models shape our worldview, we cannot understand that bats might use echolocation the same way we use vision as it is inconsistent with our models. Since we can’t use echolocation ourselves, our models cannot phantom that the bats are using it.\nI became even more interested in applying system thinking and just modelling systems based upon the systems-thinking progression. I am increasingly convinced that how I feel is a good way of understanding the world, even though I am increasingly convinced that my knowledge is extremely minuscule and I need to be very humble so as not to mess up the way I’m working too much.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIf a frog turns right and catches a fly, then turns left and catches a fly, and then turns around backward and catches a fly, the purpose of the frog has to do not with turning left or right or backward but with catching flies. If a government proclaims its interest in protecting the environment but allocates little money or effort toward that goal, environmental protection is not, in fact, the government’s purpose. Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.\n\n\nManagers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. I call such situations messes… . Managers do not solve problems, they manage messes. —RUSSELL ACKOFF, 1 operations theorist\n\n\nOnce we see the relationship between structure and behavior, we can begin to understand how systems work, what makes them produce poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns.\n\n\nThe only way to fix a system that is laid out poorly is to rebuild it, if you can. Amory Lovins and his team at Rocky Mountain Institute have done wonders on energy conservation by simply straightening out bent pipes and enlarging ones that are too small. If we did similar energy retrofits on all the buildings in the United States, we could shut down many of our electric power plants.\n\n\nI have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when looked at in the right way, did not become still more complicated. —POUL ANDERSON\n\n\nA feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows into or out of that same stock. A feedback loop can be quite simple and direct. Think of an interest-bearing savings account in a bank. The total amount of money in the account (the stock) affects how much money comes into the account as interest. That is because the bank has a rule that the account earns a certain percent interest each year. The total dollars of interest paid into the account each year (the flow in) is not a fixed amount, but varies with the size of the total in the account.\n\n\nKeeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems. I’ll get back to this point later when we come to hierarchies.\n\n\nChanges in function or purpose also can be drastic. What if you keep the players and the rules but change the purpose—from winning to losing, for example? What if the function of a tree were not to survive and reproduce but to capture all the nutrients in the soil and grow to unlimited size? People have imagined many purposes for a university besides disseminating knowledge—making money, indoctrinating people, winning football games. A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same.\n\n\nStocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with each other.\n\n\nRemember—all system diagrams are simplifications of the real world.\n\n\nBalancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to change.\n\n\nReinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity to reinforce or reproduce itself.\n\n\nthe more machines and factories (collectively called “capital”) you have, the more goods and services (“output”) you can produce. The more output you can produce, the more you can invest in new machines and factories. The more you make, the more capacity you have to make even more. This reinforcing feedback loop is the central engine of growth in an economy.\n\n\nBecause we bump into reinforcing loops so often, it is handy to know this shortcut: The time it takes for an exponentially growing stock to double in size, the “doubling time,” equals approximately 70 divided by the growth rate (expressed as a percentage).\n\n\nMany relationships in systems are nonlinear. Their relative strengths shift in disproportionate amounts as the stocks in the system shift. Nonlinearities in feedback systems produce shifting dominance of loops and many complexities in system behavior.\n\n\nThis concept of a limiting factor is simple and widely misunderstood. Agronomists assume, for example, that they know what to put in artificial fertilizer, because they have identified many of the major and minor nutrients in good soil. Are there any essential nutrients they have not identified? How do artificial fertilizers affect soil microbe communities? Do they interfere with, and therefore limit, any other functions of good soil? And what limits the production of artificial fertilizers? At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting.\n\n\nComplex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic. That may explain why hierarchies are so common in the systems nature presents to us. Among all possible complex forms, hierarchies are the only ones that have had the time to evolve.5 Paraphrased from Herbert Simon,\n\n\nSystem structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.\n\n\nModel utility depends not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior. What is adjusting the inflows and outflows?\n\n\nSystems\n• A system is more than the sum of its parts. • Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. • The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.\n• System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.     Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium\n• A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.\n• If the sum of inflows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock level will rise.\n• If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of inflows, the stock level will fall.\n• If the sum of outflows equals the sum of inflows, the stock level will not change — it will be held in dynamic equilibrium.\n• A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate. • Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.\n• Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and independent.    \nFeedback Loops\n• A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.\n• Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to change.\n• Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time.\n• The information delivered by a feedback loop—even nonphysical feedback—can affect only future behavior; it can’t deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback.\n• A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect that stock. Otherwise, the feedback process will fall short of or exceed the target for the stock.\n• Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors.     Shifting Dominance, Delays, and Oscillations\n• Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate behavior. • A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.\n• Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the behavior of a system.    \nScenarios and Testing Models\n• System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask “what if” questions.\n• Model utility depends not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior.    \nConstraints on Systems\n• In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no system can grow forever in a finite environment.\n• Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited.\n• Renewable resources are flow-limited.    \nResilience, Self-Organization, and Hierarchy\n• There are always limits to resilience.\n• Systems need to be managed not only for productivity or stability, they also need to be managed for resilience.\n• Systems often have the property of self-organization—the ability to structure themselves, to create new structure, to learn, diversify, and complexify.\n• Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper layers of the hierarchy is to serve the purposes of the lower layers.    \nSource of System Surprises\n• Many relationships in systems are nonlinear.\n• There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion.\n• At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting.\n• Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by layers of limits.\n• There always will be limits to growth.\n• A quantity growing exponentially toward a limit reaches that limit in a surprisingly short time.\n• When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight is essential.\n• The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole.    \nMindsets and Models\n• Everything we think we know about the world is a model.\n• Our models do have a strong congruence with the world.\n• Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully.\n\n\n“High leverage, wrong direction,” the system-thinking car dealer says to herself as she watches this failure of a policy intended to stabilize the oscillations. This perverse kind of result can be seen all the time—someone trying to fix a system is attracted intuitively to a policy lever that in fact does have a strong effect on the system. And then the well-intentioned fixer pulls the lever in the wrong direction! This is just one example of how we can be surprised by the counterintuitive behavior of systems when we start trying to change them.\n\n\nDelays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. They are common causes of oscillations. If you’re trying to adjust a stock (your store inventory) to meet your goal, but you receive only delayed information about what the state of the stock is, you will overshoot and undershoot your goal.\n\n\nIn short, this book is poised on a duality. We know a tremendous amount about how the world works, but not nearly enough. Our knowledge is amazing; our ignorance even more so. We can improve our understanding, but we can’t make it perfect.\n\n\nI’ve shown three sets of possible behaviors of this renewable resource system here:\n• overshoot and adjustment to a sustainable equilibrium,\n• overshoot beyond that equilibrium followed by oscillation around it, and\n• overshoot followed by collapse of the resource and the industry dependent on the resource.\n\n\nNonrenewable resources are stock-limited. The entire stock is available at once, and can be extracted at any rate (limited mainly by extraction capital). But since the stock is not renewed, the faster the extraction rate, the shorter the lifetime of the resource. Renewable resources are flowlimited. They can support extraction or harvest indefinitely, but only at a finite flow rate equal to their regeneration rate. If they are extracted faster than they regenerate, they may eventually be driven below a critical threshold and become, for all practical purposes, nonrenewable.\n\n\nResilience has many definitions, depending on the branch of engineering, ecology, or system science doing the defining. For our purposes, the normal dictionary meaning will do: “the ability to bounce or spring back into shape, position, etc., after being pressed or stretched. Elasticity. The ability to recover strength, spirits, good humor, or any other aspect quickly.” Resilience is a measure of a system’s ability to survive and persist within a variable environment. The opposite of resilience is brittleness or rigidity.\n\n\nEvolution appears to be not a series of accidents the course of which is determined only by the change of environments during earth history and the resulting struggle for existence, … but is governed by definite laws… . The discovery of these laws constitutes one of the most important tasks of the future. —Ludwig von Bertalanffy, biologist\n\n\nWhen a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called suboptimization.\n\n\nResilience, self-organization, and hierarchy are three of the reasons dynamic systems can work so well. Promoting or managing for these properties of a system can improve its ability to function well over the long term—to be sustainable. But watching how systems behave also can be full of surprises. Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper layers of the hierarchy is to serve the purposes of the lower layers.\n\n*Everything we think we know about the world is a model. Every word and every language is a model. All maps and statistics, books and databases, equations and computer programs are models. So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my mental models. None of these is or ever will be the real world.\n*Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world. That is why we are such a successful species in the biosphere. Especially complex and sophisticated are the mental models we develop from direct, intimate experience of nature, people, and organizations immediately around us.\nHowever, and conversely, our models fall far short of representing the world fully. That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised. In our heads, we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions. Most of us, for instance, are surprised by the amount of growth an exponential process can generate. Few of us can intuit how to damp oscillations in a complex system.\n\n\n\nEverything we think we know about the world is a model. Our models do have a strong congruence with the world. Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully.\n\n\nLinear relationships are easy to think about: the more the merrier. Linear equations are solvable, which makes them suitable for textbooks. Linear systems have an important modular virtue: you can take them apart and put them together again—the pieces add up. Nonlinear systems generally cannot be solved and cannot be added together… . Nonlinearity means that the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules… . That twisted changeability makes nonlinearity hard to calculate, but it also creates rich kinds of behavior that never occur in linear systems. —James Gleick, author of Chaos: Making a New Science\n\n\nThere are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute, regardless of performance. Another is to make goals sensitive to the best performances of the past, instead of the worst. If perceived performance has an upbeat bias instead of a downbeat one, if one takes the best results as a standard, and the worst results only as a temporary setback, then the same system structure can pull the system up to better and better performance. The reinforcing loop going downward, which said “the worse things get, the worse I’m going to let them get,” becomes a reinforcing loop going upward: “The better things get, the harder I’m going to work to make them even better.” If I had applied that lesson to my jogging, I’d be running marathons by now.\n\n\nRich countries transfer capital or technology to poor ones and wonder why the economies of the receiving countries still don’t develop, never thinking that capital or technology may not be the most limiting factors.\n\n\nWe are surprised over and over again at how much time things take. Jay Forrester used to tell us, when we were modeling a construction or processing delay, to ask everyone in the system how long they thought the delay was, make our best guess, and then multiply by three. (That correction factor also works perfectly, I have found, for estimating how long it will take to write a book!)\n\n\nBounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don’t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system. Fishermen don’t know how many fish there are, much less how many fish will be caught by other fishermen that same day.\n\n\nRational elites … know everything there is to know about their self-contained technical or scientific worlds, but lack a broader perspective. They range from Marxist cadres to Jesuits, from Harvard MBAs to army staff officers… . They have a common underlying concern: how to get their particular system to function. Meanwhile … civilization becomes increasingly directionless and incomprehensible. —John Ralston Saul,1 political scientist\n\n\nTHE TRAP: POLICY RESISTANCE When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance. Any new policy, especially if it’s effective, just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable effort in maintaining. THE WAY OUT Let go. Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized—\n\n\nSuccess to the successful is a well-known concept in the field of ecology, where it is called “the competitive exclusion principle.” This principle says that two different species cannot live in exactly the same ecological niche, competing for exactly the same resources. Because the two species are different, one will necessarily reproduce faster, or be able to use the resource more efficiently than the other. It will win a larger share of the resource, which will give it the ability to multiply more and keep winning. It will not only dominate the niche, it will drive the losing competitor to extinction. That will happen not by direct confrontation usually, but by appropriating all the resource, leaving none for the weaker competitor.\n\n\nIt’s not that parameters aren’t important—they can be, especially in the short term and to the individual who’s standing directly in the flow. People care deeply about such variables as taxes and the minimum wage, and so fight fierce battles over them. But changing these variables rarely changes the behavior of the national economy system.\n\n\nYou hear about catastrophic river floods much more often than catastrophic lake floods, because stocks that are big, relative to their flows, are more stable than small ones. In chemistry and other fields, a big, stabilizing stock is known as a buffer.\n\n\nPhysical structure is crucial in a system, but is rarely a leverage point, because changing it is rarely quick or simple. The leverage point is in proper design in the first place. After the structure is built, the leverage is in understanding its limitations and bottlenecks, using it with maximum efficiency, and refraining from fluctuations or expansions that strain its capacity.\n\n\nAnother of Jay Forrester’s famous systems sayings goes: It doesn’t matter how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the minds of the society about what a “fair” distribution of the tax load is. Whatever the laws say, by fair means or foul, by complications, cheating, exemptions or deductions, by constant sniping at the rules, actual tax payments will push right up against the accepted idea of “fairness.”\n\n\nRemember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible.\n\n\nThrough the Freedom of Information Act (from a systems point of view, one of the most important laws in the nation), that information became a matter of public record. In July 1988, the first data on chemical emissions became available. The reported emissions were not illegal, but they didn’t look very good when they were published in local papers by enterprising reporters, who had a tendency to make lists of “the top ten local polluters.” That’s all that happened. There were no lawsuits, no required reductions, no fines, no penalties. But within two years chemical emissions nationwide (at least as reported, and presumably also in fact) had decreased by 40 percent. Some\n\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had an unusual ability to think in feedback terms and to make feedback policies. Unfortunately, he had a hard time explaining them to a press and public that didn’t understand feedback. He suggested, at a time when oil imports were soaring, that there be a tax on gasoline proportional to the fraction of U.S. oil consumption that had to be imported. If imports continued to rise, the tax would rise until it suppressed demand and brought forth substitutes and reduced imports. If imports fell to zero, the tax would fall to zero. The tax never got passed.\n\n\nResilience: The ability of a system to recover from perturbation; the ability to restore or repair or bounce back after a change due to an outside force.\n\n\n*Guidelines for Living in a World of Systems      \n\nGet the beat of the system.\nExpose your mental models to the light of day.\nHonor, respect, and distribute information.\nUse language with care and enrich it with systems concepts.\nPay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable.\nMake feedback policies for feedback systems.\nGo for the good of the whole.\nListen to the wisdom of the system.\nLocate responsibility within the system.\nStay humble—stay a learner.\nCelebrate complexity.\nExpand time horizons.\nDefy the disciplines.\nExpand the boundary of caring.\nDon’t erode the goal of goodness.*\n\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/How-Big-Things-Get-Done":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/How-Big-Things-Get-Done","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/World/How Big Things Get Done.md","title":"How Big Things Get Done","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","non-fiction","building","construction","mega-projects","it-projects","nuclear","renewables"],"content":"How Big Things Get Done\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book explores how big projects succeed or fail and the underlying causes. Big things fail, and when they fail, they usually fail catastrophically. The book identifies the causes and explains how to fix them.\n🎨 Impressions\nExperience matters, time matters, planning matters, and modularity matters.\nExperience is paramount for team members, especially managers and senior members. Inexperience kills projects, and experience is paramount for avoiding stupid mistakes that kill projects.\nMany of the budget issues are due to unrealistic budgets because they get approved. If the actual cost were known, they would not have been approved.\nModularity is the key to having efficient buildings and projects, the more\nThe more time you spend on a project, the more likely it is that something unordinary will happen.  Therefore, a short timeframe is paramount. Speed does not kill; sloth kills.\nIf you allow yourself to experiment and fail during planning, you insulate yourself from failing during implementation.  Fail fast and learn from those failures.\nFinally, the most significant reason projects fail is because the ones responsible think that the biggest obstacle is something other than themselves.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nData show that big projects that deliver as promised are rare.\n\n\nFor average homeowners, a home remodeling can easily be one of the most expensive, complex, challenging projects they ever tackle.\n\n\nCalifornia’s bullet train to nowhere. The project was approved, and work began in a rush of excitement. But problems soon proliferated. Progress slowed. More problems arose. Things slowed further. The project dragged on and on. I call this pattern “Think fast, act slow,” for reasons I’ll explain later. It is a hallmark of failed projects.\n\n\nSuccessful projects, by contrast, tend to follow the opposite pattern and advance quickly to the finish line. That’s how the Nepal schools project unfolded. So did the Hoover Dam, which was completed a little under budget in fewer than five years—two ahead of schedule.\n\n\n“When we were in full swing going up the main tower,” Lamb’s partner Richmond Shreve recalled, “things clicked with such precision that once we erected fourteen and a half floors in ten working days—steel, concrete, stone and all.”\n\n\nThe Empire State Building had been estimated to cost 50 million. It acually cost 41 million (679 million in 2021). That’s 17 percent under budget, or 141 million in 2021 dollars. Construction finished several weeks before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nI call the pattern followed by the Empire State Building and other successful projects “Think slow, act fast.”\n\n\nThe record of big projects is even worse than it seems. But there is a solution: Speed up by slowing down.\n\n\nThere would also be an underwater tunnel for trains—the second longest in Europe—which would be built by a Danish-led contractor. That was interesting because Danes had little experience boring tunnels. I watched the announcement on the news with my father, who worked in bridge and tunnel construction. “Bad idea,” he grumbled. “If I were digging a hole that big, I would hire someone who had done it before.”\n\n\nEngineers on the project told me at the time that it would be cheaper to abandon the tunnel and start again rather than pull out the borers, drain the tunnel, and repair it. But politicians overrode them because an abandoned tunnel would be too embarrassing. Inevitably, the whole project came in very late and way over budget.\n\n\n“Project estimates between 1910 and 1998 were short of the final costs an average of 28 percent,” according to The New York Times, summarizing our findings. “The biggest errors were in rail projects, which ran, on average, 45 percent over estimated costs [in inflation-adjusted dollars]. Bridges and tunnels were 34 percent over; roads, 20 percent. Nine of 10 estimates were low, the study said.”[\n\n\n“Iron Law of Megaprojects”: over budget, over time, under benefits, over and over again.\n\n\nThe probability that any big project will blow its budget and schedule and deliver disappointing benefits is very high and very reliable.\n\n\nIn total, only 8.5 percent of projects hit the mark on both cost and time. And a minuscule 0.5 percent nail cost, time, and benefits. Or to put that another way, 91.5 percent of projects go over budget, over schedule, or both. And 99.5 percent of projects go over budget, over schedule, under benefits, or some combination of these.\n\n\nActual mean cost overrun of a major building project is 62 percent.\n\n\nMy database revealed that information technology projects have fat tails. To illustrate, 18 percent of IT projects have cost overruns above 50 percent in real terms. And for those projects the average overrun is 447 percent! That’s the average in the tail, meaning that many IT projects in the tail have even higher overruns than this. Information technology is truly fat-tailed![16] So are nuclear storage projects. And the Olympic Games. And nuclear power plants. And big hydroelectric dams. As are airports, defense projects, big buildings, aerospace projects, tunnels, mining projects, high-speed rail, urban rail, conventional rail, bridges, oil projects, gas projects, and water projects.\n\n\nIn fact, most project types have fat tails.\n\n\nFrom the dramatic to the mundane to the trivial, change can rattle or ruin a project—if it occurs during the window of time when the project is ongoing. Solution? Close the window.\n\n\nOf course, a project can’t be completed instantly, so we can’t close the window entirely. But we can make the opening radically smaller by speeding up the project and bringing it to a conclusion faster. That is a main means of reducing risk on any project. In sum, keep it short!\n\n\nTo understand the right way to get a project done quickly, it’s useful to think of a project as being divided into two phases. This is a simplification, but it works: first, planning; second, delivery. The terminology varies by industry—in movies,\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln is reputed to have said that if he had five minutes to chop down a tree, he’d spend the first three sharpening the ax.\n\n\nPlanning requires thinking—and creative, critical, careful thinking is slow.\n\n\nRome’s first emperor, the mighty Caesar Augustus, whose personal motto was “Festina lente,” or “Make haste slowly.”\n\n\nPurposes and goals are not carefully considered. Alternatives are not explored. Difficulties and risks are not investigated. Solutions are not found. Instead, shallow analysis is followed by quick lock-in to a decision that sweeps aside all the other forms the project could take. “Lock-in,” as scholars refer to it, is the notion that although there may be alternatives, most people and organizations behave as if they have no choice but to push on, even past the point where they put themselves at more cost or risk than they would have accepted at the start.\n\n\nI call such premature lock-in the “commitment fallacy.” It is a behavioral bias on a par with the other biases identified by behavioral science.\n\n\n“Act in haste, repent at leisure” is a centuries-old chestnut\n\n\n“Optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly,” observed Kahneman.\n\n\nThe physicist and writer Douglas Hofstadter mockingly dubbed it “Hofstadter’s Law”: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.”\n\n\nForty years ago, Kahneman and Tversky showed that people commonly underestimate the time required to complete tasks even when there is information available that suggests the estimate is unreasonable. They called this the “planning fallacy\n\n\n“Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.” Notice, however, that Bezos carefully limited the bias for action to decisions that are “reversible.”\n\n\n“Especially when under time pressure, they perceive planning to be wasted effort.”\n\n\nTo put that in more general behavioral terms, people in power, which includes executives deciding about big projects, prefer to go with the quick flow of availability bias, as opposed to the slow effort of planning.\n\n\nIt isn’t the bias for action promoted by Jeff Bezos; it’s a bias against thinking.\n\n\nWhen the Montreal Olympics went a spectacular 720 percent over budget, a cartoonist gleefully drew a heavily pregnant Mayor Drapeau. But so what? Drapeau got his Olympics. And although it took more than thirty years for Montreal to pay off the mountain of debt, the onus was on the taxpayers of Montreal and Quebec. Drapeau wasn’t even voted out of office; he retired in 1986.\n\n\nIn that first, almost comically rushed week, Somervell presented his plan to the secretary of war, a congressional subcommittee, and the White House cabinet, including the president. Each time, so few probing questions were asked that the blatant flaws in the plan were not revealed. And each time, the plan was quickly approved.\n\n\nIn that first, almost comically rushed week, Somervell presented his plan to the secretary of war, a congressional subcommittee, and the White House cabinet, including the president. Each time, so few probing questions were asked that the blatant flaws in the plan were not revealed. And each time, the plan was quickly approved. Somervell’s superiors simply didn’t do their jobs.\n\n\nDon’t assume you know all there is to know. If you’re a project leader and people on your team make this assumption—which is common—educate them or shift them out of the team.\n\n\nSlow isn’t good in itself. Like David and Deborah, people can spend years daydreaming about a project but have nothing more than daydreams to show for it, just as organizations can burn enormous amounts of time holding meetings filled with meandering discussions that never go anywhere. Moreover, careful analysis like that done by David’s architect can be laborious and take ages, but if it is too narrowly focused, it won’t reveal fundamental flaws in the plan or gaps, much less correct them. And by its impressive detail, it may give the false idea that the overall plan is stronger than it is, like a beautiful facade with no structure behind it.\n\n\nFrank Gehry, arguably the world’s most acclaimed architect, never starts with answers. “I grew up with the Talmud,” he told me when I interviewed him in 2021, “and the Talmud starts with a question.” That’s typical of Judaism, he says. “Jews question everything.”\n\n\nProjects are not goals in themselves. Projects are how goals are achieved.\n\n\nJeff Bezos was well aware of that danger, and he came up with an elegant way to keep Amazon focused on customers, which is the company’s primary creed. Bezos noted that when a project is successfully completed and it’s ready to be publicly announced, the conventional last step is to have the communications department write two documents. One is a very short press release (PR) that summarizes what the new product or service is and why it is valuable for customers. The other is a “frequently asked questions” (FAQ) document with more details about costs, functionality, and other concerns. Bezos’s brainstorm was to make that last step in a conventional project the first step in Amazon projects.\n\n\nPeople are terrible at getting things right the first time. But we’re great at tinkering. Wise planners make the most of this basic insight into human nature. They try, learn, and do it again. They plan like Pixar and Frank Gehry do.\n\n\n“Repetitio est mater studiorum”—“Repetition is the mother of learning.”\n\n\nA good plan is one that meticulously applies experimentation or experience. A great plan is one that rigorously applies both.\n\n\nThe Australian art critic Robert Hughes described Jørn Utzon’s entry in the design competition as “nothing more than a magnificent doodle.” That’s a little exaggerated, but not much. Utzon’s entry was so sparse that it didn’t even satisfy all the technical requirements set by the organizers, but his simple sketches were indisputably brilliant—perhaps too brilliant. They mesmerized the jury and swept objections aside, leaving a host of unanswered questions.\n\n\nThe principal mystery lay in the curved shells at the heart of Utzon’s vision. They were beautiful on two-dimensional paper, but what three-dimensional constructs would enable them to stand? What materials would they be made of? How would they be built? None of that had been figured out. Utzon hadn’t even consulted engineers.\n\n\nThe first, small step is an outline of roughly twelve pages explaining how the idea can be the basis of a story. “It’s mostly a description of what happens. Where are we? What’s going on? What happens in the story?,” said Docter. That is given to a group of Pixar employees—directors, writers, artists, and executives.\n\n\nSuch failure is so common in Silicon Valley that there is even a name for it. “Vaporware” is software that is publicly touted but never released because developers can’t figure out how to make the hype real.\n\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the standard approach for startups is to release a product quickly, even if it is far from perfect, then continue developing the product in response to consumer feedback.\n\n\nWhen a minimum viable product approach isn’t possible, try a “maximum virtual product”—a hyperrealistic, exquisitely detailed model\n\n\nExperience is invaluable. But too often it is overlooked or dismissed for other considerations. Or it is simply misunderstood and marginalized. Here’s how to avoid that.\n\n\nBut the state decided not to go that way. Instead, it hired a large number of mostly inexperienced, mostly US contractors and oversaw them with managers who also had little or no experience with high-speed rail. That’s a terrible way to run a project. But it’s common—because it’s good politics.\n\n\nA Canadian example is arguably even more egregious. When the Canadian government decided it wanted to buy two icebreakers, it didn’t buy them from manufacturers in other countries that were more experienced with building icebreakers, deciding instead to give the contracts to Canadian companies. That’s national politics. But rather than give the contracts to one company so that it could build one ship, learn from the experience, and deliver the second ship more efficiently, it gave one contract to one company and the other to another company. Splitting the contract “will not lead to these natural learning improvements,” noted a report by the parliamentary budget officer, Yves Giroux—a report that found that the estimated cost of the icebreakers had soared from 2.6 billion (Canadian) to 7.25 billion.\n\n\nBut the first-mover advantage is greatly overstated. In a watershed study, researchers compared the fates of “pioneer” companies that had been the first to exploit a market and “settlers” that had followed the pioneers into the market.\n\n\nSeattle placed a custom order and the machine was duly designed, built, and delivered. That cost 80 million, which is more than double the price of a standard boring machine. After boring a thousand feet of a tunnel that would be nine thousand feet long, the borer broke down and became the world’s biggest cork in a bottle. Extracting it from the tunnel, repairing it, and getting it back to work took two years and cost another 143 million. Seattle’s new underground highway, needless to say, was completed late and over budget, with pending litigation making further overruns likely. If the city had instead chosen to drill two standard-sized tunnels, it could have used off-the-shelf drilling equipment that had already been widely used and was therefore more reliable, and they could have hired teams experienced at running these machines. But politicians wouldn’t have been able to brag about the size of the tunnel.\n\n\nThe German philosopher Friedrich von Schelling called architecture “frozen music.”\n\n\nTechnology is “frozen experience.”\n\n\nIf we see technology this way, it is clear that, other things being equal, project planners should prefer highly experienced technology for the same reason house builders should prefer highly experienced carpenters. But we often don’t see technology this way. Too often, we assume that newer is better.\n\n\nEvery Olympic Games since 1960 for which data are available, summer and winter, has gone over budget. The average overrun is 157 percent in real terms.\n\n\nThe Olympic motto is “Faster, higher, stronger,” and host cities aspire to their own superlatives in constructing facilities.\n\n\nWhen Roger Taillibert died in 2019, the obituary in the Montreal Gazette opened by noting that the Olympic stadium had cost so much that “it took 30 years” for Quebec to pay it off. “And more than four decades later, it is still plagued by a roof that does not work.”\n\n\nBut another factor was his insistence that the project use existing, proven technologies “in order to avoid the uncertainty of innovative methods.” That included avoiding “hand work” whenever possible and replacing it with parts designed “so that they could be duplicated in tremendous quantity with almost perfect accuracy,” Lamb wrote, “and brought to the building and put together like an automobile on the assembly line.”\n\n\n“We can know more than we can tell.”\n\n\nBut as the scientist and philosopher Michael Polanyi showed, much of the most valuable knowledge we can possess and use isn’t like that; it is “tacit knowledge.” We feel tacit knowledge. And when we try to put it into words, the words never fully capture it. As Polanyi wrote, “We can know more than we can tell.”\n\n\nHighly experienced project leaders like Frank Gehry and Pete Docter overflow with tacit knowledge about the many facets of the big projects they oversee. It improves their judgment profoundly. Often, they will feel that something is wrong or that there is a better way without quite being able to say why. As a large research literature shows, the intuitions of such experts are, under the right conditions, highly reliable. They can even be astonishingly accurate,\n\n\nPractical wisdom is what Aristotle called “phronesis.” He held it in higher regard than any other virtue, “for the possession of the single virtue of phronesis will carry with it the possession of them all [i.e., all the relevant virtues],” as he emphasized.\n\n\nIn short, if you have phronesis, you’ve got it all. Therefore, a project leader with abundant phronesis is the single greatest asset a project can have. If you have a project, hire a leader like that.\n\n\nRemove the words custom and bespoke from your vocabulary. They’re a desirable option for Italian tailoring if you can afford it, not for big projects.\n\n\nWhen delivery fails, efforts to figure out why tend to focus exclusively on delivery. That’s understandable, but it’s a mistake, because the root cause of why delivery fails often lies outside delivery, in forecasting, years before delivery was even begun.\n\n\nHave made a forecast the same way and come up with a similar\n\n\nWeeks each in Caro’s case. That’s the “anchor.” Then you slide the figure up or down as seems\n\n\nIn psychology, the process Caro used to create his forecast is known as “anchoring and adjustment.”[6] Your estimate starts with some fixed point, twelve chapters of three weeks each in Caro’s case. That’s the “anchor.” Then you slide the figure up or down as seems reasonable, to one year for Caro. That’s “adjustment.” Caro was exactly right to call his thinking “naïve but perhaps not unnatural” because, as abundant research shows, anchoring and adjustment, particularly when immediate experience is used as the anchor, is a natural way of thinking. It’s likely that most people in Caro’s position, with his specific experience, would have made a forecast the same way and come up with a similar result.\n\n\nFinal estimates made this way are biased toward the anchor, so a low anchor produces a lower estimate than a high anchor does. That means the quality of the anchor is critical. Use a good anchor, and you greatly improve your chance of making a good forecast; use a bad anchor, get a bad forecast.\n\n\nMuch subsequent research revealed that people will anchor in almost any number they happen to be exposed to prior to making their forecast.\n\n\nIn big organizations there’s almost always somebody with a sense of realism. But they were lone voices.\n\n\nOnce we frame the problem as one of time and money overruns, it may never occur to us to consider that the real source of the problem is not overruns at all; it is underestimation. This project was doomed by a large underestimate. And the underestimate was caused by a bad anchor.\n\n\nTo understand what a reference class is, bear in mind that there are two fundamentally different ways to look at a project.\n\n\nThe first is to see it as its own special undertaking. All projects are special to some degree.\n\n\nThis is the “uniqueness bias” we encountered in the previous chapter.\n\n\nCultural anthropologist Margaret Mead supposedly told her students, “You’re absolutely unique, just like everyone else.” Projects are like that. Whatever sets a project apart, it shares other characteristics with projects in its class.\n\n\nAn opera house may be one of a kind because of its design and location, but it still has plenty in common with other opera houses, and we can learn a lot about how to construct a particular opera house by looking at opera houses in general and considering our opera house to be “one of those.” The category of opera houses is the reference class.\n\n\nThe class mean is the anchor, and the anchor is your forecast. That’s very simple, yes. But simple is good; it keeps out bias. I came to call this process “reference-class forecasting” (RCF).\n\n\nUsing reference-class forecasting is “the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods.”\n\n\n“This time is different” is the motto of uniqueness bias.\n\n\nExhaustive planning that enables swift delivery, narrowing the time window that black swans can crash through, is an effective means of mitigating this risk. Finishing is the ultimate form of black swan prevention;\n\n\nInterestingly, early delays are not seen as a big deal by most project leaders. They figure they have time to catch up, precisely because the delays happen early. That sounds reasonable. But it’s dead wrong. Early delays cause chain reactions throughout the delivery process. The later a delay comes, the less remaining work there is and the less the risk and impact of a chain reaction.\n\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt got it right when he said, “Lost ground can always be regained—lost time never.”\n\n\nAnd the answers are right under your nose in the tail of the reference class; you just need to dig them out.\n\n\nAs with reference-class forecasting, the big hurdle to black swan management is overcoming uniqueness bias. If you imagine that your project is so different from other projects that you have nothing to learn from them, you will overlook risks that you would catch and mitigate if you instead switched to the outside view.\n\n\n“A little neglect may breed great mischief.”\n\n\nThis is why high safety standards are an excellent form of risk mitigation and a must on all projects. They’re not just good for workers; they prevent little things from combining in unpredictable ways into project-smashing black swans.\n\n\nBlack swans are not fate. We are not at their mercy. That said, it is important to acknowledge that risk mitigation—like most things in life—is a matter of probability, not certainty.\n\n\nEmpire State Building struggled to attract paying tenants and was nicknamed the “Empty State Building” during the 1930s.\n\n\nHirschman argued that planning is a bad idea. “Creativity always comes as a surprise to us,” he wrote. “Therefore, we can never count on it and we dare not believe in it until it has happened.” But if we know that big projects pose big challenges that can be overcome only by creativity and we don’t trust creativity to deliver its magic when we need it, why would anyone ever launch a big project?\n\n\nIn the social sciences, “survivorship bias” is the common mistake of noting only those things that made it through some selection process while overlooking those that didn’t.\n\n\nLittle of that was Utzon’s fault. But he was the architect, so he was blamed and fired midconstruction. He left Australia in secret and in disgrace. His reputation was ruined. Instead of being showered with commissions to build more masterpieces, Utzon was marginalized and forgotten. He became what no masterbuilder wants to be or deserves to be. He became a one-building architect.\n\n\nIndeed, there’s reason to think that desperation may actually hinder the imaginative moments that elevate a project to glory. Psychologists have studied the effects of stress on creativity for decades, and there is now a substantial literature showing that it has a largely—though not entirely—negative effect.\n\n\nImaginative leaps belong in planning, not delivery. When stakes and stress are low, we are freer to wonder, try, and experiment. Planning is creativity’s natural habitat.\n\n\nAs important as it is to do the slow thinking that produces excellent planning and forecasting, acting fast in delivery takes more than a strong plan; you need an equally strong team. How are diverse people and organizations with different identities and interests turned into a single “us”—a team—with everyone rowing in the same direction: toward delivery?\n\n\nA strong plan greatly increases the probability of a swift and successful delivery. But it’s not enough. As any experienced project manager will tell you, you also need a capable\n\n\nA strong plan greatly increases the probability of a swift and successful delivery. But it’s not enough. As any experienced project manager will tell you, you also need a capable, determined delivery team. The success of any project depends on getting the team right—“getting the right people on the bus,” as one colleague metaphorically put it, “and placing them in the right seats,” as another added.\n\n\nThere are five project types that are not fat-tailed. That means they may come in somewhat late or over budget but it’s very unlikely that they will go disastrously wrong. The fortunate five? They are solar power, wind power, fossil thermal power (power plants that generate electricity by burning fossil fuels), electricity transmission, and roads.\n\n\nNuclear power plants are one of the worst-performing project types in my database, with an average cost overrun of 120 percent in real terms and schedules running 65 percent longer than planned. Even worse, they are at risk of fat-tail extremes for both cost and schedule, meaning they may go 20 or 30 percent over budget. Or 200 or 300 percent. Or 500 percent. Or more.\n\n\nFirst, you can’t build a nuclear power plant quickly, run it for a while, see what works and what doesn’t, then change the design to incorporate the lessons learned. It’s too expensive and dangerous. That means that experimentation—one-half of the experiri I discussed in chapter 4—is out. You have no choice but to get it right the first time.\n\n\nSecond, there’s a problem with experience—the other half of experiri. If you are building a nuclear power plant, chances are that you haven’t done much of that before for the simple reason that few have been built and each takes many years to complete, so opportunities to develop experience are scarce.\n\n\nModularity is a clunky word for the elegant idea of big things made from small things. A block of Lego is a small thing, but by assembling more than nine thousand of them, you can build one of the biggest sets Lego makes, a scale model of the Colosseum in Rome. That’s modularity.\n\n\nLatin saying goes, “Repetitio est mater studiorum”—“Repetition is the mother of learning.”\n\n\nManufacturing in a factory and assembling on-site is far more efficient than traditional construction because a factory is a controlled environment designed to be as efficient, linear, and predictable as possible.\n\n\nThe technical term for this property is “scale free,” meaning that the thing is basically the same no matter what size it is. This gives you the magic of what I call “scale-free scalability,” meaning you can scale up or down following the same principles independently of where you are scalewise, which is exactly what you want in order to build something huge with ease.\n\n\nBack in 2017, before it really ramped up, I estimated that between 6 trillion and 9 trillion per year would be spent globally on giant projects in the following decade. That estimate was conservative compared to others, which went as high as $22 trillion per year.\n\n\nIf the dismal record of big projects were improved even a little—by cutting the cost by a mere 5 percent, say—300 billion to 400 billion would be saved per year.\n\n\nWhereas a turbine in 2000 might have been a little taller than the Statue of Liberty and able to power 1,500 homes, a turbine in 2017 was almost double that height and capable of powering 7,100 homes.\n\n\nIn 2017, with oil and gas vanishing from its business, Ørsted took its new name in honor of the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered electromagnetism.\n\n\n“Think slow, act fast” is an example of a heuristic.\n\n\nHeuristics are mental shortcuts used to reduce complexity, making decisions manageable. Heuristics are often tacit and need to be deliberately teased out before they can be shared verbally. Wise people, including successful project leaders—plus your grandmother and anyone else with phronesis—work to refine and improve their heuristics throughout life.\n\n\nSometimes say that this is my only heuristic because the masterbuilder—named after the skilled masons who built Europe’s medieval cathedrals—possesses all the phronesis needed to make your project happen.\n\n\nGET YOUR TEAM RIGHT This is the only heuristic cited by every project leader I’ve ever met.\n\n\n“WHY?” Asking why you’re doing your project will focus you on what matters, your ultimate purpose, and your result. This goes into the box on the right of your project chart. As the project sails into a storm of events and details, good leaders never lose sight of the ultimate result. “No matter where I am and what I’m doing in the delivery process,” noted Andrew Wolstenholme, the leader who delivered Heathrow’s Terminal 5 in chapter 8, “I check myself constantly by asking whether my present actions effectively contribute to the result on the right.”\n\n\nBig is best built from small. Bake one small cake. Bake another. And another. Then stack them.\n\n\nPlanning is relatively cheap and safe; delivering is expensive and dangerous. Good planning boosts the odds of a quick, effective delivery, keeping the window on risk small and closing it as soon as possible\n\n\nKNOW THAT YOUR BIGGEST RISK IS YOU\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/How-the-World-Really-Works":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/How-the-World-Really-Works","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/World/How the World Really Works.md","title":"How the World Really Works","links":[],"tags":["books","technology","climate-crisis","oil","energy","non-fiction","environmentalism","food","industralization","science","biology","biosphere"],"content":"How the World Really Works\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is for the naturalist and realists that are concerned about the environment. It goes through the most critical things that drive our modern society, cement, steel, ammonia and plastic, and goes through what it takes to produce said elements. You don’t get that enthusiastic about a zero-oil society by reading it.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt is quite easy to read, and it is good to be informed about the status of the world and the mechanisms that drives society forwards.\nVitaly Katsenelson had an annual shareholder meeting and discussed it and recommended it. I immediately started reading it.\nAll who think about environmentalism, and are concerned about the environment should read this. It is a somber read to be sure but it is important for us to understand these things in a technological way.\nI did not think it was such a huge scale everything, and how insanely important steel, cement and ammonia were for society. Things that I did not know but was super interested to learn:\n\nHaber-Bosch process most important invention the last 100 years, if not more.\nHow much environmental impact seafood has, more than any other type of food (Not sure about beef but still). I think this is in diesel consumed.\nEnergy prices rule the world.\n\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAmerica now has only about 3 million men and women (farm owners and hired labor) directly engaged in producing food—people who actually plow the fields, sow the seeds, apply fertilizer, eradicate weeds, harvest the crops (picking fruit and vegetables is the most labor-intensive part of the process), and take care of the animals. That is less than 1 percent of the country’s population\n\n\n*This is a radical shift that will create Earth’s oxygenated atmosphere, yet a long time elapses before new, more complex aquatic organisms are seen 1.2 billion years ago, when the probes document the rise and diffusion of brilliantly colored red algae (due to the photosynthetic pigment phycoerythrin) and of much larger, brown algae. Green algae arrive nearly half a billion years later.\n\n\nThe best reconstructions show that coal as a heat source in England surpasses the use of biomass fuels around 1620 (perhaps even earlier); by 1650 the burning of fossil carbon supplies two-thirds of all heat; and the share reaches 75 percent by 1700.\n\n\nBy 1800 a passing probe will record that, across the planet, plant fuels still supply more than 98 percent of all heat and light used by the dominant bipeds, and that human and animal muscles still provide more than 90 percent of all mechanical energy needed in farming, construction, and manufacturing.\n\n\nEven by 1850, rising coal extraction in Europe and North America supplies no more than 7 percent of all fuel energy, nearly half of all useful kinetic energy comes from draft animals, about 40 percent from human muscles, and just 15 percent from the three inanimate prime movers:\n\n\nBy 1950, fossil fuels supply nearly three-quarters of primary energy (still dominated by coal).\n\n\nIn 1886, Ludwig Boltzmann, one of the founders of thermodynamics, spoke about free energy—energy available for conversions—as the Kampfobjekt (the object of struggle) for life, which is ultimately dependent on incoming solar radiation.\n\n\nErwin Schrödinger, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933, summed up the basis of life: “What an organism feeds upon is negative entropy” (negative entropy or negentropy = free energy\n\n\n“Energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy.”\n\n\nIt is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives … always the same number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas.\n\n\nMost recently, a poor understanding of energy has the proponents of a new green world naively calling for a near-instant shift from abominable, polluting, and finite fossil fuels to superior, green and ever-renewable solar electricity. But liquid hydrocarbons refined from crude oil (gasoline, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, residual heavy oil) have the highest energy densities of all commonly available fuels, and hence they are eminently suitable for energizing all modes of transportation.\n\n\n*Here is a density ladder (all rates in gigajoules per ton):\n\nair-dried wood, 16\nbituminous coal (depending on quality), 24–30\nkerosene and diesel fuels, about 46\nIn volume terms (all rates in gigajoules per cubic meter), energy densities are only about 10 for wood, 26 for good coal, 38 for kerosene. Natural gas (methane) contains only 35 MJ/m3—or less than 1/1,000 of kerosene’s density.*\n\n\n\nThere could be no natural gas–powered flight, as the energy density of methane is three orders of magnitude lower than that of aviation kerosene, and also no coal-powered flight—the density difference is not that large, but coal would not flow from wing tanks to engines.\n\n\nLubricants are needed to minimize friction in everything from the massive turbofan engines in wide-body jetliners to miniature bearings. Globally, the automotive sector, now with more than 1.4 billion vehicles on the road, is the largest consumer, followed by use in industry—with the largest markets being textiles, energy, chemicals, and food processing—and in ocean-going vessels. Annual use of these compounds now surpasses 120 megatons (for comparison, global output of all edible oils, from olive to soybean, is now about 200 megatons a year),\n\n\nA very high reliability of electricity supply—grid managers talk about the desirability of reaching six nines: with 99.9999 percent reliability there are only 32 seconds of interrupted supply in a year!—\n\n\nMoreover (as will be explained in chapter 3), we have no readily deployable commercial-scale alternatives for energizing the production of the four material pillars of modern civilization solely by electricity. This means that even with an abundant and reliable renewable electricity supply, we would have to develop new large-scale processes to produce steel, ammonia, cement, and plastics.\n\n\nAnnual global demand for fossil carbon is now just above 10 billion tons a year—a mass nearly five times more than the recent annual harvest of all staple grains feeding humanity, and more than twice the total mass of water drunk annually by the world’s nearly 8 billion inhabitants—and it should be obvious that displacing and replacing such a mass is not something best handled by government targets for years ending in zero or five.\n\n\nPutting the crop in takes about 27 hours of human labor for every seeded hectare.\n\n\nSecuring the crop takes at least 120 hours of human labor per hectare.\n\n\nAltogether, it takes about 10 minutes of human labor to produce a kilogram of wheat, and that would, with wholegrain flour, yield 1.6 kilograms (two loaves) of bread.\n\n\nAll of these are highly energy-intensive products but they are applied in relatively small quantities (just fractions of a kilogram per hectare). In contrast, fertilizers that supply the three essential plant macronutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—require less energy per unit of the final product but are needed in large quantities to ensure high crop yields.\n\n\nPotassium is the least costly to produce, as all it takes is potash (KCl) from surface or underground mines.\n\n\nSince the 1970s, the synthesis of nitrogenous fertilizers has undoubtedly been the primus inter pares among agricultural energy subsidies\n\n\nAnd no other vegetable (although botanically a fruit) surpasses the annual production of tomatoes, now grown not only as a field crop but increasingly in plastic or glass greenhouses.\n\n\nBotanically, a tomato is the fruit of the Lycopersicon esculentum, a small plant native to Central and South America that was introduced to the rest of the world during the age of first European transatlantic sailings but which took generations to establish worldwide appeal.\n\n\nUnder this sea of plastic, the Spanish growers and their local and immigrant African laborers produce annually (in temperatures often surpassing 40°C) nearly 3 million tons of early and out-of-season vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, green beans, zucchini, eggplant, melons) and some fruit, and export about 80 percent of it to EU countries.\n\n\nIts total is equivalent to about 650 mL/kg, or more than five tablespoons (each containing 14.8 milliliters) of diesel fuel per medium-sized (125 gram) tomato!\n\n\nAs it turns out, capturing what the Italians so poetically call frutti di mare is the most energy-intensive process of food provision.\n\n\nSo, the evidence is inescapable: our food supply—be it staple grains, clucking birds, favorite vegetables, or seafood praised for its nutritious quality—has become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels. This fundamental reality is commonly ignored by those who do not try to understand how our world really works and who are now predicting rapid decarbonization.\n\n\nDuring the pre-1920 peak of US horse and mule numbers, one-quarter of the country’s farmland was dedicated to growing feed for the more than 25 million American working horses and mules—and at that time US farms had to feed only about 105 million people.\n\n\nSynthetic fertilizers supply 110 megatons of nitrogen per year, or slightly more than half of the 210–220 megatons used in total.\n\n\nEven so, such farms could produce only overwhelmingly vegetarian diets for 10–11 people per hectare. In contrast, China’s most productive double-cropping depends on applications of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers averaging more than 400 kg N/ha, and it can produce enough to feed 20–22 people whose diets contain about 40 percent animal and 60 percent plant protein.\n\n\nRecall that synthetic fertilizers now supply more than twice as much nitrogen as all recycled crop residues and manures (and given the higher losses from organic applications, the effective multiple is actually closer to three!).\n\n\nThe quest for mass-scale veganism is doomed to fail. Eating meat has been as significant a component of our evolutionary heritage as our large brains (which evolved partly because of meat eating), bipedalism, and symbolic language.\n\n\nConversely, most people who become vegetarians or vegans do not remain so for the remainder of their lives.\n\n\nThe idea that billions of humans—across the world, not only in affluent Western cities—would willfully not eat any animal products, or that there’d be enough support for governments to enforce that anytime soon, is ridiculous.\n\n\nWhile veganism is a waste of valuable biomass (only ruminants—that is cattle, sheep, and goats—can digest such cellulosic plant tissues as straw and stalks), high-level carnivory has no proven nutritional benefits: it certainly does not add any years to life expectancy, and it is a source of additional environmental stress.\n\n\nAnd in China, the world’s largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer, only a third of the applied nitrogen is actually used by rice; the rest is lost to the atmosphere and to ground and stream waters.\n\n\nA nearly perfect solution would be to develop grain or oil crops with the capabilities common to leguminous plants—that is, with their roots hosting bacteria able to convert inert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates.\n\n\nProducing large, high-purity (99.999999999 percent pure) silicon crystals that are cut into wafers is a complex, multi-step, and highly energy-intensive process: it costs two orders of magnitude more primary energy than making aluminum from bauxite, and three orders of magnitude more than smelting iron and making steel.\n\n\nBut the raw material is super-abundant (Si is the second-most common element in the Earth’s crust—nearly 28 percent, compared to 49 percent for oxygen) and the annual output of electronic-grade silicon is very small compared to other indispensable materials, recently on the order of 10,000 tons of wafers.\n\n\nAnd while there can be no indisputable ordering of our material needs based on claims of their importance, I can offer a defensible ranking that considers their indispensability, ubiquity, and the demand size. Four materials rank highest on this combined scale, and they form what I have called the four pillars of modern civilization: cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia.\n\n\nIn 2019, the world consumed about 4.5 billion tons of cement, 1.8 billion tons of steel, 370 million tons of plastics, and 150 million tons of ammonia, and they are not readily replaceable by other materials—certainly not in the near future or on a global scale.\n\n\nAs a result, global production of these four indispensable materials claims about 17 percent of the world’s primary energy supply, and 25 percent of all CO2 emissions originating in the combustion of fossil fuels—and currently there are no commercially available and readily deployable mass-scale alternatives to displace these established processes.\n\n\nSimply restated: in 2020, nearly 4 billion people would not have been alive without synthetic ammonia. No comparable existential constraints apply to plastics or steel, nor to the cement that is required to make concrete (nor, as already noted, to silicon).\n\n\nThis dependence easily justifies calling the Haber-Bosch synthesis of ammonia perhaps the most momentous technical advance in history.\n\n\nAbout 80 percent of global ammonia production is used to fertilize crops; the rest is used to make nitric acid, explosives, rocket propellants, dyes, fibers, and window and floor cleaners.\n\n\nUrea, the solid fertilizer with the highest nitrogen content (46 percent), dominates.\n\n\nAbout 150 megatons of ammonia are now synthesized annually, with about 80 percent used as fertilizer. Nearly 60 percent of that fertilizer is applied in Asia, about a quarter in Europe and North America, and less than 5 percent in Africa.\n\n\nBut plastics have found their most indispensable roles in health care in general and in the hospital treatment of infectious diseases in particular. Modern life now begins (in maternity wards) and ends (in intensive care units) surrounded by plastic items.\n\n\nSteels (the plural is more accurate as there are more than 3,500 varieties) are alloys dominated by iron (Fe).\n\n\nIts high carbon content makes it brittle, it has low ductility (the ability to stretch), and its tensile strength (resistance to breaking under tension) is inferior to that of bronze or\n\n\nCrude oil refineries are essentially forests of steel, with tall distillation columns, catalytic crackers, extensive piping, and storage vessels.\n\n\nMoreover, steel is readily recycled by melting it in an electric arc furnace (EAF)—a massive cylindrical heat-resistant container made of heavy steel plates (lined with magnesium bricks), with a removable dome-like water-cooled lid through which three massive carbon electrodes are inserted. After loading the steel scrap, the electrodes are lowered into it, and electric current passing through them forms an arc whose high temperature (1,800°C) easily melts the charged metal. However, their electricity demand is enormous: even a highly efficient modern EAF needs as much electricity every day as an American city of about 150,000 people.\n\n\nThe combination of a blast furnace and a basic oxygen furnace is the basis of modern integrated steelmaking.\n\n\nIronmaking is highly energy-intensive, with about 75 percent of the total demand claimed by blast furnaces.\n\n\nThe total energy requirement of global steel production in 2019 was about 34 exajoules, or about 6 percent of the world’s primary energy supply.\n\n\nCement is the indispensable component of concrete, and it is produced by heating (to at least 1,450°C) ground limestone (a source of calcium) and clay, shale, or waste materials (sources of silicon, aluminum, and iron) in large kilns—long (100–220 meters) inclined metal cylinders.\n\n\nAs already noted, the new material was excellent in compression, and today’s best concretes can withstand pressure of more than 100 megapascals, which is about the weight of an African bull elephant balanced on a coin.\n\n\nTension is a different matter: a pulling force of just 2 to 5 megapascals (less than it takes to tear human skin) can break concrete apart.\n\n\nBut during the second decade of the 21st century, China averaged about 230 billion of foreign direct investment a year, compared to less than 50 billion for India and just around $40 billion for all of sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa).\n\n\nCassius Dio wrote in 116 CE how the emperor Trajan, during his temporary occupation of Mesopotamia, stood at the Persian Gulf’s shore watching a ship leaving for India and wishing that he were as young as Alexander, who had led his armies to that faraway country.\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch built only 1,450 new ships for Asian trade (averaging seven a year) with capacities of just 700–1,000 tons. That was good enough to make a profit carrying such high-value cargoes as spices, tea, and china, but completely uneconomical for any trade in bulk commodities\n\n\nNavigation came first, in 1765, with John Harrison’s fourth highly accurate sea clock, a chronometer which made it possible to determine exact longitude.\n\n\nThe scale of global economic expansion between 1950 and 1973 is best illustrated by the growing output of the four material pillars of modern civilization (for their assessment, see chapter 3) and by the world’s rising energy demand (see chapter 1).[49] Steel production nearly quadrupled (from about 190 to 698 megatons per year), cement production increased almost sixfold (from 133 to 770 megatons), ammonia synthesis almost eightfold (from less than 5 to 37 megatons of nitrogen), and plastic output was more than 26 times higher (from less than 2 to 45 megatons).\n\n\n2019 the Mediterranean Shipping Company put into service six giant vessels each able to carry 23,756 standard containers, hence a 12-fold increase of maximum vessel capacity between 1973 and 2019.\n\n\nBut across the Rhine it is not only the German Greens who believe that nuclear power is an infernal invention that must be eliminated as fast as possible, but much larger portions of society too.\n\n\nOur species, like all other chemoheterotrophs (organisms that cannot internally produce their own nutrition), requires its constant supply.\n\n\nThe beginnings of the oxygenated atmosphere go back to what has become known as the Great Oxidation Event, which began about 2.5 billion years ago. During that period, oxygen released by oceanic cyanobacteria began to accumulate in the atmosphere, but it took a long time before the gases reached their modern concentrations. During the past 500 million years, atmospheric oxygen levels fluctuated widely, being as low as about 15 percent and as high as 35 percent before they declined to today’s nearly 21 percent of the Earth’s atmosphere by volume.\n\n\nAnytime a plant opens its stomata (located on the underside of leaves) to import sufficient carbon for its photosynthesis, it loses large amounts of water.\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, SUVs became the second-highest cause of rising CO2 emissions, behind electricity generation and ahead of heavy industry, trucking, and aviation.\n\n\nSUV ownership began to rise in the US during the late 1980s, it eventually diffused globally, and by 2020 the average SUV emitted annually about 25 percent more CO2 than a standard car. Multiply that by the 250 million SUVs on the road in 2020, and you will see how the worldwide embrace of these machines has wiped out, several times over, any decarbonization gains resulting from the slowly spreading ownership (just 10 million in 2020) of electric vehicles.\n\n\nThe UN’s first conference on climate change took place in 1992; annual climate change conferences began in 1995 (in Berlin) and included much publicized gatherings in Kyoto (1997, with its completely ineffective agreement), Marrakech (2001), Bali (2007), Cancún (2010), Lima (2014), and Paris (2015). Clearly, the delegates love to travel to scenic destinations with hardly any thought of the dreaded carbon footprint generated by this global jetting.\n\n\nThere is no shortage of media, celebrities, and bestselling authors repeating, supporting, and amplifying these claims, ranging (no surprise) from Rolling Stone to the New Yorker, and from Noam Chomsky (who adds energy as his latest field of expertise) to Jeremy Rifkin, who believes that without such an intervention our fossil-fueled civilization will collapse by 2028.\n\n\nDe omnibus dubitandum (Doubt everything) must be more than a durable Cartesian quote; it must remain the very foundation of the scientific method.\n\n\nHere is how a green energy CEO put it in 2020: “Do you remember how we transformed telephony from fixed-line phones to mobile phones, television from watching whatever was on TV to whatever we fancied, from buying newspapers to customising our news feeds? The people-led, tech-powered energy revolution is going to be just the same.”\n\n\nNo plane powered by nuclear fission ever took off, but several nuclear bombs were detonated in the quest for expanded natural gas production. A 29-kiloton bomb (more than twice as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima) was detonated in December 1967 at a depth of about 1.2 kilometers in New Mexico (code name Project Gasbuggy); in September 1969 came a 40-kiloton bomb in Colorado; in 1973 three 33-kiloton bombs, also in Colorado; and the US Atomic Energy Commission anticipated future detonations of 40–50 bombs a year.\n\n\nNone of those much-touted capabilities was of any use in preventing the rise or controlling the diffusion of those viral RNA strands. The best we could do is what the residents of Italian towns did in the Middle Ages: stay away from others, stay inside for 40 days, isolate for quaranta giorni. Vaccines came relatively early, but they do not cure the stricken and they do not prevent the next pandemic.\n\n\nFour of the continent’s five most populous nations (UK, France, Italy, and Spain) and two of its richest countries (Switzerland and Luxembourg)—whose health systems were for decades praised as paragons of excellence—recorded some of the world’s highest pandemic mortalities.\n\n\nThis difference is so large that we can find no equivalent among the properties separating the two most notable classes of terrestrial animals: birds and mammals. The difference between the body masses of the smallest and the largest mammals (the Etruscan shrew at 100 grams and the African elephant at 106 000 grams) is “just” six orders of magnitude. The difference between the wingspan of the smallest and the largest flying birds (the bee hummingbird at 3 centimeters and the Andean condor at 320 centimeters) is only two orders of magnitude.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Letters-to-a-Young-Contrarian":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Letters-to-a-Young-Contrarian","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/World/Letters to a Young Contrarian.md","title":"Letters to a Young Contrarian","links":[],"tags":["books","debate","truth-seeking","knowledge","contrarianism","politics"],"content":"Letters to a Young Contrarian\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about being right, not being in the crowd etc. It is advice on how to stay true to the principles.

It was an astonishing opportunity to play Devil’s Advocate in the literal sense, and I must say that the Church behaved with infinitely more care and scruple than my liberal critics. A closed room, a Bible, a tape-recorder, a Monsignor, a Deacon and a Father—a solemn exercise in deposition, where I was encouraged to produce all my findings and opinions. I’ll tell you all about it at another time; the point is that the record is not now the monopoly of the fundamentalists.\n\n\nAdlai Stevenson once said to Richard Nixon: “If you stop telling lies about me I’ll stop telling the truth about you.”\n\n\nThe term “intellectual” was originally coined by those in France who believed in the guilt of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. They thought that they were defending an organic, harmonious and ordered society against nihilism, and they deployed this contemptuous word against those they regarded as the diseased, the introspective, the disloyal and the unsound.\n\n\nThere is a saying from Roman antiquity: Fiat justitia—ruat caelum. “Do justice, and let the skies fall.”\n\n\nGalileo himself, as he finished his recantation, may or may not have murmured, “epur si muove”—“It still does move.”\n\n\nThis would be idiocy in its pejorative sense; the Athenians originally employed the term more lightly, defining as idiotis any man who was blandly indifferent to public affairs.\n\n\nSigmund Freud’s memorial in Vienna appear the words: “The voice of reason is small, but very persistent.”\n\n\nSantayana’s definition of the fanatic, they redouble their efforts just when they have lost sight of their ends.\n\n\nA truth that’s told with bad intent Beats all the lies you can invent\n\n\nSantiago Alvarez, the grand old man of Cuban cinema. Film was the special medium of the Cuban revolution and he assured us that it was unfettered. Completely unfettered? Well, he said with a slight laugh, there is one thing that is not done. No satirical portrayal of the Leader will be permitted. (The slight laugh was at the very idea that anyone would even dream of proposing such a thing.) I said, quite simply, that if the main subject of Castro was off-limits then, in effect, there could be no real satire or criticism at all. I had heard and read of the term “counterrevolutionary,” but this was the first time I heard it applied in all seriousness—and to myself, at that.\n\n\nBut, as Laplace is supposed to have said when demonstrating his model of the solar system at court, and on being asked where the Prime Mover was: “It can work without that assumption.”\n\n\nAs the great Eugene Debs used to tell his socialist voters in the 1912 election campaign, he would not lead them into a Promised Land even if he could, because if they were trusting enough to be led in, they would be trusting enough to be led out again.\n\n\nMajor Danby replied indulgently with a superior smile, “But, Yossarian, what if everyone felt that way?” “Then I’d certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way, wouldn’t I?”\n\n\nCamus observed that if compelled to choose between Justice and his mother, he might well have to pick his mother.\n\n\nBeware of identity politics. I’ll re-phrase that: have nothing to do with identity politics. I remember very well the first time I heard the saying “The Personal Is Political.”\n\n\nIt is told of Freud that when he was trapped in Vienna by the Anschluss, he asked the Nazis for a safe-conduct to leave. They granted this on condition that he signed a statement saying that he had been well-treated. He asked for permission to add an extra sentence and to their delighted surprise wrote: “I can thoroughly recommend the Gestapo to anybody.”\n\n\nThe rebel, he says, secretly quite wants the world and the system to remain as it is. Its permanence, after all, is the guarantee of his continuing ability to “rebel.” The revolutionary, in contrast, really wishes to overthrow and replace existing conditions. The second enterprise is obviously no laughing matter.\n\n\nDante was a sectarian and a mystic but he was right to reserve one of the fieriest corners of his inferno for those who, in a time of moral crisis, try to stay neutral.\n\n\nTo train the condemnation upon the Utopians is to miss the historical point (the point made in Animal Farm, among other places) that Utopians become tyrants when they start to emulate their former masters\n\n\nAn official of the Teamsters’ Union, asked by a Senate hearing if his union was really powerful, responded guardedly but elegantly by saying that being powerful was a little like being ladylike: “If you have to say you are, you prob’ly ain’t.”\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Material-World":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Material-World","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/World/Material World.md","title":"Material World","links":["Science/World/How-the-World-Really-Works","History/Things/Chip-War"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","materials","material-science","chips","software","electricity","industralization","oil"],"content":"Material World\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book covers some of the most important materials in today’s world. It covers the extraction, refinement, and use and explains why the material is important and its challenges.  It is also, by extension, a book about the modern world.\n🎨 Impressions\nWhat is profoundly fascinating is that much of the production of critical elements is limited to a few places. For example, the production of neon gas in Azovstal, the mines in Peru for copper, etc.\nIt is a bit similar to How the World Really Works and Chip War and has a lot of linkage to those two books.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThese perpendicular formations, a product of the prevailing winds, are called seif dunes – after the Arabic word for ‘sword’ – and some run for nearly a hundred miles.\n\n\nGeologists have something called the Udden–Wentworth scale, which dictates that any solid, loose grain of a given size (strictly speaking somewhere between 0.0625mm and 2mm) is a type of sand.\n\n\nImagine we compressed the entire existence of this planet into one calendar year: so the earth formed at midnight on 1 January and now, the moment you’re reading this, is the very microsecond of midnight, 365 days later on New Year’s Eve. Single-celled organisms would begin to form in late February. Some of the oldest existing rocks would form in early March. The Lewisian gneiss, a series of rocks you will find further up the coast from Lochaline, would form in April, which is to say up to 3 billion years ago. But life as we might recognise it, the first insects and reptiles, would not evolve until the beginning of December, about the same time as the Great Glen Fault was splitting Scotland apart. The age of the dinosaurs would begin on 13 December and end on 26 December. That meteor probably responsible for Libyan desert glass would smash into the Great Sand Sea early in the morning on 29 December, while the very first human-like animals would evolve at 5.18pm, early in the evening of 31 December. What of Homo sapiens ? Well, we would finally arrive, late to the party, a few hundred thousand years ago, which is to say: at about a quarter to midnight on New Year’s Eve.\n\n\n‘Le béton? Mais c’est de la boue! ’ (Concrete? But it’s just mud! )\n\n\nA few years ago, Mexico began providing families with the cement to pave over dirt floors, with the consequence that parasitic infections dropped by 78 per cent. The number of children with diarrhoea dropped by half; those with anaemia dropped by four-fifths. There were all sorts of other happy outcomes too – children did better at school, their mothers became happier and less depressed. And all thanks to a cheap bag of cement.\n\n\nWe tend to underestimate the importance of the built world. Shelter is one of humanity’s primary needs, yet it is easy, when you have a roof over your head and a firm floor beneath you, to forget this.\n\n\nThere are now more than 80 tonnes of concrete on this planet for every person alive – around 650 gigatonnes in total. To put that slightly meaningless number into perspective, it is considerably more than the combined weight of every single living thing on the planet: every cow, every tree, every human, plant, animal, bacterium and single-celled organism.\n\n\nThe problem with CCS is that while it works in theory, it is so expensive that it is hard to make the sums add up – especially in a high-volume, low-margin sector like cement.\n\n\nThe latest such chips can fit roughly 15 million transistors into a dot the size of a single full stop on this page. The transistors in today’s smartphones are not just smaller than a red blood cell (about a thousand times smaller, as it happens); they are smaller than the COVID-19 virus. Actually you could fit four of them inside a coronavirus, each transistor having about the same dimensions as one of the virus’s spike proteins, those club-like tendrils radiating out from its centre.\n\n\nThere are many weird and wonderful manufacturing techniques in the Material World but the Czochralski process is among the most captivating. The polysilicon is tipped into a quartz crucible (the crucible must be incredibly pure, or else it may introduce impurities back into the silicon) and heated up to just under 1,500°C. A seed crystal, a pencil-sized rod of silicon, is dipped into the melt and is then slowly pulled upwards, rotating slightly. Gradually, a perfect, solid ingot, a boule, begins to form out of the melt.\n\n\n‘Here’s something scary,’ says one veteran of the sector. ‘If you flew over the two mines in Spruce Pine with a crop duster loaded with a very particular powder, you could end the world’s production of semiconductors and solar panels within six months.’\n\n\nAny movement, however indiscernible, can disturb the workings of the machinery here, which is why you don’t tend to find fabs very close to airports or motorways.\n\n\nFor some decades, transistors have been etched on to silicon wafers not by hand or by physical machinery, but by light. The principle is a little like a movie projector, except in reverse. While a projector takes a small image and uses lenses to blow it up to a cinema-sized screen, photolithography begins with a big blueprint of a silicon chip, with all its transistors and features, and uses lenses to project that image down into mind-bogglingly small dimensions.\n\n\nChina’s semiconductor import costs as of 2017 were greater than Saudi Arabia’s total revenue from oil exports, or for that matter the entire global trade in aircraft.\n\n\nFab 18 might be where the world’s most advanced chips are made, but they are mostly designed elsewhere, primarily in the US, with intellectual property that derives from a company based in Cambridge, England: ARM. TSMC’s fabs would not function without machine tools from the Netherlands and Japan, or chemicals from Germany and bits and pieces from a range of other nations. There is only a handful of companies capable of making perfect silicon wafers, and none is headquartered in either the US or China. And there is only one site in the world capable of making the quartz sand for the crucibles where those wafers are crystallised. When politicians talk lazily about re-shoring, it often betrays a deep ignorance of what is happening out there in the Material World.\n\n\nLouis’s finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert once famously remarked that ‘The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest number of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.’\n\n\nCeltic and then Roman settlements were built around these springs in Middlewich and Northwich, Nantwich and Leftwich. Over time the -wich suffix in a town’s name came to denote saltworking.\n\n\nDeepest point here is nearly 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) underground, which is nothing compared with, say, the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa, which is the world’s deepest at 4 kilometres. At that kind of depth the rock temperature is 66°C. At Boulby the rocks are a mere 39°C, though that is only the starting point.\n\n\nIron was not the first metal we learned to smelt (as you’ll see in the following section) but these days it is the archetypal one, accounting for roughly 95 per cent of all the metal we produce and use.\n\n\nJust look at a ranking of the substances we dig, blast and pump out of the planet’s surface each year. Sand and gravel: 43 billion tonnes; oil and gas: 8.1 billion tonnes; coal: 7.7 billion tonnes; iron ore: 3.1 billion tonnes. And like pretty much all of those materials, our appetite for this metal shows no sign of abating: after a dip in 2020 during the pandemic, global iron ore output hit a record high in 2021.\n\n\nAt one end of the spectrum is cast iron or pig iron (so named because when it was first made it would set in a series of channels and moulds resembling a litter of piglets being nursed by their mother).\n\n\nDamascus, whose swords have such a fine steel grain that even today no one has worked out how to replicate\n\n\nArms makers of Damascus, whose swords have such a fine steel grain that even today no one has worked out how to replicate\n\n\nIn a typical farm in New England in 1800, with mostly wooden tools, it took just over seven minutes of labour to yield a kilogram of grain. In 1850, with cast iron tools, the same job took just under three minutes. By 1900, with steel tools, it was less than 30 seconds per kilogram.\n\n\nIn 2018, as he announced the imposition of tariffs on steel imports, Donald Trump tweeted that he was doing so to protect the US and its workers. ‘IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL,’ he wrote in his characteristic block capitals, ‘YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!’\n\n\nMao called it the Great Leap Forward, and it certainly boosted iron production, but since neither the chairman nor many of his advisors understood the difference between iron and steel, they were dismayed to discover that much of what came out of the backyard furnaces they had commissioned was brittle, useless iron – not steel. And that metal nonetheless had a terrible cost. In the following years China experienced the worst famine in history. Tens of millions of people – the final toll is still debated today but conservative estimates range from 17 to 30 million – died of starvation and fatigue in those four years between 1958 and 1962.\n\n\nHughes, whose father had been chief engineer at the ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil, was by then in charge of the Millwall Iron Works in London, one of the biggest producers in the UK, supplying all of the Royal Navy’s iron for cladding its ships. In 1870 he set sail for the Sea of Azov and made his way north to the Donbas. Within a couple of years his ironworks were up and running and in the following decades this complex of blast furnaces would become the biggest iron producer in the Russian Empire. He founded a nearby settlement, which became known as Yuzovka (Hughes-ovka). Today the town has become a city, since renamed as Donetsk; it is the capital of Ukraine’s industrial heartlands.\n\n\nThere are bigger blast furnaces in Korea and China, and Russia still forges millions of tonnes of steel at the plant at Magnitogorsk. But there were other unexpected consequences. Since Azovstal and its fellow Ukrainian steel mills were responsible for producing nearly half the world’s supply of neon, in the weeks after Tskitishvili began the shutdown, the world began to run short of the gas.\n\n\nEach year we empty staggering quantities of coal – more than a billion tonnes, which works out at comfortably more than the combined weight of every human being on the planet – into the thousand or so blast furnaces operating around the world. The iron that comes out the other end may not have much carbon embedded in it, but its production entails the creation of enormous quantities of CO2 – around 7–8 per cent of the global total.\n\n\nAround 70 per cent of the world’s niobium – a rare earth element that helps harden steel for use in jet engines, critical pipelines, superconducting magnets, and the skeletons of bridges and skyscrapers – comes from a single mine in Brazil.\n\n\nOnce upon a time the UK produced more steel than any other country. This was where modern blast furnaces and steel manufacture began. Today, China produces more steel every two years than the UK’s entire steel output since the industrial revolution.\n\n\nNo other people on earth can claim to have had as long a continuous cultural history as the Aboriginal populations\n\n\nIn the 1960s a two-man helicopter from US Steel’s Brazilian unit was forced to land on a hill in this region. Quite why it landed in this remote spot is usually glossed over, but one version of the story popular among mining experts is that one of the geologists desperately needed to relieve himself. He stepped out and answered the call of nature, whereupon he looked down and noticed that the ground had gone a peculiar colour. There were rocks lying around of the same colour, so he picked one of them up; it was surprisingly heavy. He smacked it with a hammer and it cracked apart to reveal a vivid red surface. This was pure – incredibly pure – iron ore. Today, Carajás is the single biggest iron mine in the world, and is the explanation for why mining insiders sometimes quip that the most valuable feature of an exploration geologist is a small bladder.\n\n\nBack before the arrival of electricity, ‘ironing was the worst’, according to one Texas housewife. ‘Nothing could ever be as hard as ironing.’\n\n\nWhen electricity came to these outposts and towns, the very first item most families bought was an electric iron. Such things are long forgotten these days. When historians talk about the coming of electricity they usually talk about the obvious stuff – the replacement of dim kerosene lamps with bright lightbulbs and the introduction of electric pumps so water no longer had to be heaved all the way from the well. But what made electricity the next greatest thing after the love of God was that it rapidly improved nearly every aspect of everyday life, from the big to the small.\n\n\nThe story of how Swansea became the world capital for copper production – Copperopolis as it was widely known – despite mining barely a particle of the metal, is another of those forgotten tales of the Material World, yet it’s well worth recounting, given it provided the world with an economic model it still deploys today.\n\n\nOf every 13 grams of copper ever mined and refined from this planet’s crust, at least one of them came from here.\n\n\n‘Bad news,’ he wrote in the journal Science , ‘sells books, newspapers, and magazines; good news is not half so interesting.’ He then ran through a host of claims, many of them from Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb and The Limits to Growth , and declared them almost universally false.\n\n\nCyprus (whose Greek name, Kupros, is where we get the word copper from),\n\n\nThe reason we have about 30 to 40 years’ worth of copper reserves left (42 at the time of writing) is not because that is what’s left in the ground, but because that’s the kind of time horizon over which miners tend to make plans.\n\n\nResources, it turns out, are a measure not just of what we have already pencilled in for future extraction, but all the metal under the ground, including stuff yet to be discovered.\n\n\nMany oilfields have been discovered both before and since, but nothing like Ghawar. There is a category given to fields with proven reserves of more than 500 million barrels of oil: giants. Then there are those with 5 billion or more: the super-giants. Ghawar is bigger than any super-giant ever discovered before or since. Its precise size is still debated today – and indeed it is ever-changing as more reserves of oil and gas are discovered – but it has already produced more than 70 billion barrels of oil and has around 50 billion more still available underground.\n\n\nOils can also be ‘sweet’ or ‘sour’ – a measure of sulphur content, which dates back to the early days when crude was mostly used for indoor lighting. Too much sulphur in your kerosene and not only was there a noxious smell when it burned, it would also tarnish the silver in your lamp. Back then the quickest way to test for this before burning was to give it a quick taste – the more sulphur, the more sour it was –\n\n\nGrowing crops inside rather than outside, in large conservatories or even vertical farms with artificial lighting, means a single acre can yield as much as 400 times what you get from a typical field.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the world’s crops are sustained by nitrogen fertilisers created from natural gas. The vast majority of the world’s animals are fed with food sustained by fertilisers created from natural gas. If fertilisers are among the most important substances in the world – and given that without them it would be impossible to support nearly half of the global population it’s a fair bet to say they are – then so too is gas.\n\n\nToday, polyethylene has become comfortably the most widely used plastic in the world. Every six seconds we make enough of it in Europe to wrap the Eiffel Tower from head to toe. Every six seconds! We produce about 100 million tonnes a year – which is more than the combined global production of copper and aluminium.\n\n\nMany countries have now banned single-use plastic shopping bags and other items like plastic straws. In some cases these bans have been short-sighted: the manufacture of paper bags and straws can create considerably more carbon emissions than their plastic counterparts. A plastic straw can be reused multiple times whereas a paper straw is unlikely to make it through more than a few sucks – as any parent of a young child will testify.\n\n\nBut since a fully laden VLCC tanker’s hull is too deep to navigate the shallow waterways of Suez, they will offload some of their crude into pipes at the Ain Sukhna terminal before sailing through the canal to the Mediterranean and picking up their oil at the other end.\n\n\nWere China to shift all its coal-fired power stations on to gas, then the world would immediately be on track to hit its climate goals.\n\n\nQatar pumps the gas up through pipes and the CO2 and sulphur are removed at the steel jungle of Ras Laffan. It is hard, even as one paces through this astonishing complex of metalwork, to comprehend just how much this place matters. This single place provides around 4 per cent of global energy – comfortably more than every solar panel and wind turbine in the world combined.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Stuff-Matters":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Science/World/Stuff-Matters","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Science/World/Stuff Matters.md","title":"Stuff Matters","links":["Science/World/Material-World"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","materials","material-science","science","scientific-method","materials/steel","materials/paper","materials/oil","materials/carbon"],"content":"Stuff Matters\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA book about a lot of stuff.

This is due to quantum mechanics. Higher energy lights such as UV radiation are not able to pass through glass. You cannot get a tan or sunburn through glass.\nPyrex is glass mixed with boron dioxide.\nIn Bohemia (Czech Republic) in 1840, A new method of mass-producing glassware was invented. The result was that people could drink beer from glasses. Not surprisingly, people did not take pleasure in seeing the dark brown bear color. So naturally not 10 years later and your beer was invented in there by Pilsen.\nAccording to the UK government, more than 5000 people are touched with class and bottles every year, costing an estimated £2 billion to surgically repair the injuries.\nThe biggest ‘natural’ diamond ever found was extracted from the Callion mine in 1907 and was the size of a football.\nDiamond derives from Greek ‘Adamas’ meaning unalterable or unbreakable\nDe Beers controlled 90% of the world’s diamond production in 1902.\nGraphite is soft because of its weak van der Waals forces.\nSapphires are aluminum oxide with ion impurities and rubies are aluminum oxide with chromium impurities\nBessemer process: the process of making cheap steel.\nGillette (King Camp first name) used the Bessemer process to create disposable razors.\nStainless steel was created by accident, Harry Brearly discovered a steel chromium aloe that lay in a rusted pile in great condition.

They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.’  That is a super exciting quote.\nExecution is to practice, as strategy is to theory.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAncient Greek strategos, meaning the ‘art of troop leader;\n\n\nIn 2012 Cynthia Montgomery published a book anyone interested in strategy should know well as a great starting point to understand its purpose – The Strategist.\n\n\nIBM has estimated that bad data costs US companies $3.1 trillion a year, equating to 12 per cent of revenue.\n\n\n‘Data is great, but strategy is better!’ Steven Sinofsky\n\n\nThe data strategy should certainly cover the following from the ecosystem: Data management, as it is commonly termed, including structured and unstructured data, by which I mean: data standards; data architecture; data governance and quality; data integration and migration; data acquisition; data transformation and exchange (that is, with other parties, requiring typically a memorandum of understanding between both organisations); data compliance – including regulations and any other legal constraints – and corporate data security; data accessibility – providing appropriate access to the people who need it; master data management – which systems hold the primary version of data, and which leads in to the systems strategy, in terms of rationalising (potentially part of technology debt) or acquiring systems.\n\n\nData exploitation, which can be subdivided into:  reporting and the provision of MI, especially key performance indicators (KPIs), usually involving dashboards and other visualisation techniques; analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive), including the application of machine learning and AI (sometimes referred to as data science); insight – the gathering of additional information and data through research activities to fill gaps in understanding or test out approaches, and the benchmarking and baselining of activities and performance to determine comparative performance with other organisations conducting similar activities; knowledge management to garner real insight from a myriad of internal sources that are often unstructured and difficult to capture and/or harmonise to deliver coherent insight for the organisation in a structured form.\n\n\nThe data strategy will start the process of making people within your organisation recognise data as an asset\n\n\nEnsure the data strategy is written in plain English (or whatever language it will be produced in), avoiding technical terms, ambiguity and acronyms and, most of all, keeping it simple.\n\n\nIt stated that research had identified that in the previous year 67 per cent of well-formulated strategies failed due to poor execution – two in three, which demonstrated there was clearly more chance of a strategy failing than it delivering.\n\n\nCarucci identified a number of causes for such alarming failures in executive appointments and strategy execution: They lack depth in their competitive context. They are dishonest or naive about trade-offs. They leave old organizational designs in place. They can’t handle the emotional toll.\n\n\nThe first year Bridges conducted the survey, in 2002, 90 per cent of strategy implementations failed on the measure of achieving at least 50 per cent of the intended outcomes in the time set. In the 2012 survey, 80 per cent of business leaders felt their company was good at crafting strategy, but only 44 per cent saw similar capabilities in execution. Worse still, only 2 per cent believed the implementation would achieve 80–100 per cent of the objectives set.\n\n\nPerversely, the survey found business leaders spent more time on strategy implementation than crafting the strategy itself, and 96 per cent that thought that their bonuses should be tied to successful strategy implementation.\n\n\nData, and its exploitation, sits at the heart of every business and is increasingly important as its capture becomes ever more complex as the channels through which it is made available and updated expand.\n\n\nOrganisations that want to exploit the potential of their data need a coherent way to ensure there is clarity on what is to be achieved, and this is where a data strategy comes in. What it often highlights, though, is that there is a lot of foundation work to be done to get the data into a state to exploit it fully, as fragmentation of data, poor data quality and missing or obsolete data are generally common barriers for all organisations. This in itself is useful, but can often feel like taking a giant stride backwards before being able to go forwards.\n\n\nThere are a number of challenges in positioning the data strategy, especially if this is the first time your organisation has embarked on having one, and it is important you are able to comprehend the environment that led to it being commissioned.\n\n\nIdentify who ‘owns’ the data strategy in your organisation, and ensure the expectations are clear and roles are defined.\n\n\nLook to include the management of data and the exploitation of it within the data strategy if possible – this links the investment in the foundations to the potential value generated to the wider organisation.\n\n\nRemember the CLEAR principles – clarity, leadership, execution, agility and relevancy – in preparation for embarking on defining the data strategy. These are key to making sure you are prepared and have evaluated fully your starting point and the direction in which you are heading.\n\n\n‘Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it’s about deliberately choosing to be different.’\n\n\nOne of the challenges with developing a data strategy, particularly if this is the first time the organisation will have had one, is determining the scope.\n\n\nAt its simplest level, a data strategy is a vision for where you want to be that helps the organisation achieve its overall goals more efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nSimply reviewing the key systems in the organisation to identify where data resides and cataloguing it is the starting point of a coherent approach to master data management, providing clarity on which sources of data are to be used (the master data), defining the metadata to underpin a common understanding of that data, and taking the first step to a data quality programme to improve quality and hence reliability.\n\n\nIt should go without saying that you have to deliver for the credibility of your sponsor to remain intact. Do not overpromise and under-deliver, and ensure the activity you undertake is time bound so you are able to demonstrate progress.\n\n\nThere are many organisations that invest time and effort in developing a strategy only for it to fail to make it to implementation – it becomes shelfware. The strategy may have been partly implemented, not as a strategic implementation, but simply because it made good sense to do so, and you should guard against finding fragments of the strategy and concluding it must have been implemented.\n\n\nIn some organisations the commitment to strategy is such that it has its own team, or even function. This might suggest that such an organisation is a strong advocate of defining and implementing strategy, but there is a common trap that occurs in such a situation, which I shall call the theorists dilemma. Often, the strategy team has been formed with the best of intentions, with the senior executives within the organisation being aware that there is a need for a strategy but not having the skills or the time to define one. The answer? To recruit and develop a strategy team to lead this important activity. The problem? It has instantly created a siloed approach in which strategy is a stand-alone function in the organisation.\n\n\nThe intent is fine but the execution has divorced it from the very people who need to define and implement the strategy and have the skin in the game to both make it realistic and enable it to be held to account. The\n\n\nData permeates every part of the organisation, so it is essential that all are included to some degree in the construction and approval of the data strategy.\n\n\nThe most common failures with data strategies are a lack of engagement, with too many people within the organisation being totally unaware the organisation even has a data strategy.\n\n\nThe strategy process is heavily focused on meeting that expectation, it is a good indicator that the organisation is doing this because of external pressure rather than because an internal driver has set the direction.\n\n\nAssess the readiness and maturity of the organisation at the outset.\n\n\nIdentify the key drivers for the commissioning of the data strategy and adopt the appropriate response to navigate your way through to deliver something of value to the organisation.\n\n\nReview the scope and reset if appropriate before you make a start. Be clear on what is expected and the timeline to achieve it.\n\n\nStakeholder engagement and communication will be key to avoid failure. Ensure you understand your starting point – what the stakeholders believe and expect of the data strategy, their commitment to it and how you maintain a dialogue.\n\n\nDon’t discount quick wins to gain support through being opportunist. These may be imperfect in the longer term, but will build confidence and establish credibility if there is any doubt about the value a data strategy might bring to the organisation.\n\n\n‘Strategists who don’t take time to think are just planners.’\n\n\nNo matter how polished you believe the data strategy is, you are not the target audience and so not the person who determines whether it is deemed a success.\n\n\nUse yet another acronym to try to keep the evolving data strategy on track – PRIDE: purpose, relevance, inspiring, deliverable, enabling. This provides a useful way to consider the intent of the data strategy through its composition.\n\n\nThe purpose of creating a data strategy is apparently simple – to devise a data strategy to move the organisation forward in the broadest sense of data-related activities, whilst focusing on how this helps support the corporate strategy\n\n\nThe data strategy needs to be relevant to those who are intended to read it.\n\n\nI described in earlier chapters how the data strategy needs to be an enabler of the corporate strategy, in terms of both providing a consistent thread through priorities as well as identifying those things that can raise the bar of the corporate strategy.\n\n\nTo succeed, the data strategy needs to become embedded as part of the culture of the organisation. This is evidenced by the organisation becoming more data-focused, information literate and confident in using evidence to make decisions, which in turn delivers benefits that can be directly linked back to the data strategy.\n\n\nTo get traction, remember it is about a RAVE. Without relevance, awareness, value and execution, the data strategy is incomplete and so will be lacking an essential component for a successful outcome.\n\n\nGood plan is like a road map: it shows the final destination and usually the best way to get there.’\n\n\n‘A good plan is like a road map: it shows the final destination and usually the best way to get there.’\n\n\nHave previously made the point that there are two common failures with data strategies that lead to their becoming either shelfware or forgotten, and that is a lack of realism, or practical application to the current starting point, in terms of what it lays out as the vision to be delivered through the data strategy, and a lack of keeping it simple, or grounded in that reality.\n\n\nI have previously made the point that there are two common failures with data strategies that lead to their becoming either shelfware or forgotten, and that is a lack of realism, or practical application to the current starting point, in terms of what it lays out as the vision to be delivered through the data strategy, and a lack of keeping it simple, or grounded in that reality.\n\n\nThere are some key elements you would expect to find in a data strategy: a strong data management vision; a coherent business case to support investment (even if that is just resources within the organisation, these still come at a cost); some guiding principles, values and alignment to the corporate vision; clearly articulated goals related to data; evaluation criteria and metrics to track success; clarity on the data strategy programme vision to be delivered; clarity of roles and responsibilities.\n\n\nMy recommendation is to contain the data strategy within 12–20 pages, and to focus on the high-level direction setting whilst providing waymarkers as a guide to drive the expected pace in the implementation phase.\n\n\nThe French mathematician Blaise Pascal famously wrote, ‘I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.’\n\n\nThe starting point of a data strategy should be an assessment of where you are starting from as an organisation, and this applies in particular with the maturity of the organisation related to data management.\n\n\nThe final stage of the data lifecycle is to archive or, in most cases, destroy the data. In some (rare) cases, the data may not be destroyed due to the legal requirement to retain it or it being a matter for public record.\n\n\nMost consulting firms use these, and there are certainly versions, like the McKinsey maturity model on analytic capability and utilisation,\n\n\nThe acid test should be whether the data strategy is coherent enough to be picked up and delivered in the way you intended, recognising there will always be a degree of latitude required as events unfold and time informs what were assumptions made earlier.\n\n\nStrategy implementation is a high-risk activity; most fail.\n\n\n‘You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can’t get them across, your ideas won’t get you anywhere.’ Lee Iacocca\n\n\nThe Herzberg model of motivational behaviours is an interesting perspective on what motivates people and what the hygiene factors are that must be right but are not, in themselves, motivational.\n\n\nThere are formal models to enable you to assess organisational maturity which look at benchmarks for process, quality, collaboration, knowledge, training and development, and change, amongst other things, depending on which model you choose to deploy. However, for the purposes of the data strategy, the requirement is less detailed\n\n\nCulture and employee engagement are at the top of the list for programmatic failures worldwide, so do not underestimate this and prepare extensively for what you need to do to succeed.\n\n\n‘All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.’ Earl Nightingale\n\n\nThis found that a third of respondents at the best executing organisations identified implementation as a strategic activity in itself with lessons learnt fed back into the process, compared to just 11 per cent at other organisations. In addition, 59 per cent of those organisations who were best at execution involved staff who set the high-level strategy in its implementation, compared to just 23 per cent elsewhere.\n\n\n‘several widely held beliefs that managers hold about how to implement strategy are just plain wrong’.\n\n\nThe five critical myths they focused on were: Execution equals alignment. Execution means sticking to the plan. Communication equals understanding. A performance culture drives execution. Execution should be driven from the top.\n\n\nWaymarkers are guidelines to give the data strategy some context as to the intended course and pace of delivery but are not constraints or inflexible; their purpose is simply to assist in translating the breadth of the data strategy into something navigable and to give some insight into the intent of those who devised and delivered the strategy in the first place.\n\n\nAs W. Edwards Deming said: ‘Two basic rules of life are: 1) Change is inevitable. 2) Everybody resists change.’ Your challenge is to accept the first premise by taking the waymarkers and recognising the data strategy is not a fixed programme to be followed to the letter, whilst ensuring that the second rule does not apply to you, nor those you are collaborating with and dependent upon to ensure the implementation is a success.\n\n\nStrategy execution fails not through the lack of clarity, but a lack of will to work together when it becomes reality. Therefore, it is imperative that you are challenging and retain a healthy dose of scepticism on the commitments of those you need to pull together on this until you see the behaviours translate into positive, collaborative outcomes.\n\n\n‘There are two fatal errors that keep great projects from coming to life: Not finishing Not starting’\n\n\nGeneral George S. Patton, renowned for his dislike of indecision, stated: ‘A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.’\n\n\n‘Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.’\n\n\nOne.’18 The implementation plan will translate the data strategy into a series of defined deliverables to achieve, via milestones, the waymarkers you outline within the data strategy. The plan will iterate and evolve, shaped by\n\n\nVoltaire: ‘Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.’\n\n\nThe most effective organisations at strategy execution treat implementation as a strategic activity, with the same people involved in both definition and execution.\n\n\nThe mobilisation phase of your data strategy implementation is critical to success. It enables detail to be gathered to ensure readiness to begin implementation, establishing the data strategy baseline, assumptions and key drivers.\n\n\nAvoid strategy paralysis. There is never a period in which total knowledge is captured, so accept it is a world of change and embrace it. As Voltaire said, certainty is an absurd position. Utilise Agile, engage with your sponsor and gather facts as you go to refine the inputs that shape the plan and its deliverables\n\n\nA star chamber is a scrutiny board which challenges rigorously the thinking and decision-making process to test out how effective and optimal the proposal or outcome is likely to be. It usually consists of people with significant experience who have not been directly involved. It is named after the court that sat in the Old Palace of Westminster between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries that was composed of judges and privy councillors.\n\n\n2013. eiuperspectives.economist.com/strategy-leadership/why-good-strategies-fail\n\n\nProject One, the management consulting firm, talk about the benefits of a full mobilisation approach in a blog post (projectone.com/blogs/mobilising-change-programme/) and as an article (projectone.com/mobilising-change-programmes-ive-started-so-ill-finish/\n\n\n‘You have to be fast on your feet and adaptive or else a strategy is useless.’ Attributed to Charles de Gaulle\n\n\nMobilisation has given you the opportunity to review the continued relevance of the data strategy at a more detailed level, challenging the RAID log and enhancing it to provide the level of data you are going to need to be able to track an active RAID log as part of the implementation of the data strategy.\n\n\nAccountability should never be shared\n\n\nOne final observation. The use of RACI within organisations does not mean that it is necessarily followed. This may seem a perverse statement: after all, the whole point is to assign roles and responsibilities.\n\n\nIf there is anything experienced programme managers will tell you about what made for successful programme delivery, one of their key messages would almost certainly be the need to focus your plan on what you intend to do, even if reality quickly becomes divergent from it. As Winston Churchill put it: ‘Those who plan do better than those who do not plan even though they rarely stick to their plan.’\n\n\n‘Strategy must have continuity. It can’t be constantly reinvented,’ adding: ‘continuity of strategic direction and continuous improvement in how you do things are absolutely consistent with each other. In fact, they’re mutually reinforcing.’\n\n\nIndeed, Masaaki Imai, regarded as the father of kaizen – defined as gradual, unending improvement, doing ‘little things’ better; setting, and achieving, ever higher standards – describes incremental change as a key part of continuous improvement. He says it is ‘not a paradigm shift or invention, but slow and steady progress is the most innovative.\n\n\nThink about this carefully. Try to remember the last six to ten corporate messages you were told, set them down and try to identify the important ‘takeaway’ message in each. Do the same with some colleagues in different areas who should have had the same corporate messages.\n\n\nMany strategy implementations fail as the communications all but dry up, starting off with gusto and then turning into a trickle some months down the line, till there is no communication being issued at all.\n\n\nA study by Stieglitz (2012) found over 70 per cent of failed projects were due to a lack of requirements gathering.\n\n\nDocumented requirements have a breadth of detail encompassing all aspects – technical, functional, operational – and so tend to be created by those more closely associated with the technical detail who are focused on the delivery end of the activity, which can remove the level of engagement with the end stakeholder more closely associated with the user case.\n\n\nFinally, I would like to highlight the importance of transparency in the reporting of benefits to ensure those who are engaged in some capacity\n\n\nJeff Austin, the former Vice-President, Strategy Planning, at DuPont Pioneer said: ‘Are we doing what we said we would be doing?’\n\n\nChange is inevitable, so do not stick rigidly to the plan. Constant review is necessary, but if you find a need to diverge so far that it no longer relates to the data strategy as defined, you may need to redefine the data strategy.\n\n\nHarvard Business Review and Strativity Group identified 62 per cent, the highest rate of failure, was due to poor communications. Referenced in S. Percy, Why Do Change Programmes Fail? Forbes. 13 March 2019. www.forbes.com/sites/sallypercy/2019/03/13/why-do-change-programs-fail/#112e91872e48\n\n\n‘Change is inevitable. … Change is constant.’\n\n\nThe role of the sponsor is critical if and when you reach this point. The sponsor has not only potentially greater awareness of the wider political dimension as to what is driving the wider change decision, but also the network to be able to influence some of the audience you need to engage to enable you to gather all of your facts and get the right level of buy-in to the recommendations you put forward.\n\n\nIn some organisations, data is misleadingly put with the CIO on the grounds it resides in systems and so logically belongs to the CIO. Aside from the fact that not all data is in systems – unstructured data is often still paper-based,\n\n\nIn terms of data strategy, I have been an advocate of adopting a rolling view rather than operating to fixed points of time throughout my career.\n\n\n‘To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.’\n\n\n‘The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year.’\n\n\nPrior to commencing implementation, it is good practice to revisit the success criteria to evaluate whether these are still accurate, measurable and achievable in the time permitted.\n\n\nThe KAB model is also referred to as a social cognition model, or knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) model.\n\n\nAvoid embarking on a data strategy solely for compliance reasons.\n\n\nAcquisitions – often the acquisition of one organisation by another will have a significant dependency on systems and data integration. Any delay in addressing these just continues to carry inefficiencies, resulting in a higher cost base and eradicating value through management time devoted to reconciling two organisations trying to operate as one.\n\n\nThe evolutionary approach is typical of most data strategy implementations. This is just as acceptable a way of proceeding with the data strategy implementation, as it can be executed alongside other changes which are managed through a dependency on other activity, thus reducing the scale of the programme to be managed directly by the implementation team.\n\n\nThe skills to move the data strategy forward in either definition or execution will depend entirely on the maturity of your organisation in the data arena.\n\n\nTry to get senior leaders and a few others involved; don’t think you have to convey the message alone. As I have said a number of times in this book, recognise the importance of influencers within the group, the people who are recognised for talking sense and project credibility amongst their peers.\n\n\nLike water; it is renewable and a source of life for your organisation.\n\n\nData is like water; it is renewable and a source of life for your organisation.\n\n\nResilience is key. You may have a project team, or it may be a singular endeavour. Either way, there will be ups and downs in the programme, and you need to prepare for these and keep others motivated when there are days that don’t go so well.\n\n\nFinally, learn as you deliver. I am an advocate of rolling strategies, adjusting and reflecting as each year passes, using learning to adapt and evolve the strategy to suit business needs and the experience gained in strategy implementation\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/Driving-Digital-Strategy":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/Driving-Digital-Strategy","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Strategy/Driving Digital Strategy.md","title":"Driving Digital Strategy","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","strategy","data/strategy","digital-management","digital-transformation","management","business-transformation"],"content":"Driving Digital Strategy\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book covers how digital transformations are shaping all industries (Software eating the world). It covers platforms, product as a service and analytics as important concepts.\n🎨 Impressions\nIt was interesting, but a bit of the usual business book nonsense.\nI kinda felt it did a good job of highlighting concepts within digitalization as well as strategies and examples.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nThe Weather Company is a case in point. When consumers moved away from TV to mobile phones but did not stay long enough to generate ad revenues, the company execs pivoted and created a service called WeatherFX, which uses data from its app to help retailers predict how the weather will affect consumer purchasing behavior.\n\n\nCreating an independent unit is like launching a speedboat to turn around a large ship. Often the speedboat takes off but does little to move the ship.\n\n\nIn 2012, Kasper Rorsted, CEO of Henkel at the time, realized this when he asked a team of senior leaders to catalog all of Henkel’s digital initiatives. He was shocked to find over 150 separate digital initiatives throughout the company.\n\n\nIn 1960, Theodore Levitt, a Harvard Business School professor, published a provocative paper in Harvard Business Review in which he argued that companies were too focused on products and not enough on customer needs. To help managers address this problem, he asked, “What business are you really in?”\n\n\nIn 1979, Michael Porter, one of my colleagues at Harvard Business School, published a landmark paper in which he argued that a company could follow one of two potential strategies for competitive advantage: either by being cheaper (that is, as a low-cost producer) or by being different (with differentiated products that command higher prices).\n\n\nAlthough Amazon started as a low-cost player without the fixed cost of stores, it is not product-centric knowledge that gives it an advantage of differentiation or low cost. Instead, Amazon has mastered three skills: Deep knowledge of customers obtained from mining customer data. This is embedded in the recommendation system for books and movies as well as in the introduction of new products and services. Back-end logistics for warehousing and shipping that could rival the logistics systems of FedEx and UPS. With its investment in drones and now its own trucking business, Amazon is further strengthening this part of its competency. Knowledge of and ability to manage technology infrastructure. This has allowed it to become not only one of the largest online retailers but also a dominant player in cloud computing.\n\n\nIn many cases the value of a product (e.g., WhatsApp) increases as more consumers use it, without any change in the product’s features or functionality. This is the direct network effect. In addition, as a product becomes a platform that connects, say, buyers and sellers (e.g., eBay), it gains from indirect network effect.\n\n\nThe two most valuable assets of a company today are its data and its customer base, yet they don’t show up in the balance sheet.\n\n\nBezos explained how Amazon shifted from selling electronics to manufacturing them: “There are two ways to extend a business … Take inventory of what you’re good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills.\n\n\nIn other words, concerts were the razors to sell music albums—the blades.\n\n\nMusic studios and artists had traditionally used concerts to generate awareness and excitement among fans in order to sell and make money on music albums. In other words, concerts were the razors to sell music albums—the blades.\n\n\nCompanies have used the razor-blade strategy for a long time: sell razors cheap to make money on the blades.\n\n\nHecht and his team found many surprising correlations. Some were hard to explain, such as that strawberries and raspberries sold far better when it was humid outside! Others made a lot of sense after some reflection. For instance, at a particular dew point, people in Dallas rush to buy bug spray … because insects’ eggs hatch at that dew point.\n\n\nYet other insights were intriguing. During bad weather, for example, women worry about logistics, such as getting kids from school or groceries from the market. For men, by contrast, the same inclement weather seems an occasion for watching sports, hosting parties, and buying beer.\n\n\nLevitt, a Harvard Business School professor, once said that people don’t buy drills; they buy holes.\n\n\nWhile a product-focused company would continue to make its drills better, a customer-focused company would think of new technologies, such as laser, which could be used to achieve the outcome (in this case, creating a hole) that the customer is looking for.\n\n\nAccenture found that payment models such as pay-per-use and power-by-the hour were preferred by an overwhelming 70 percent of consumers to the full up-front product purchase\n\n\nCoase argued that firms exist because of transaction costs. Simply put, it would be too difficult and costly for you to get up every morning and find a day’s work that was suitable to your skill.\n\n\nGE’s analysis showed that a 1 percent efficiency gain could lead to billions of incremental dollars for its customers.\n\n\nDeloitte, a consulting firm, defines business ecosystems as “dynamic and co-evolving communities of diverse actors who create and capture new value through both collaboration and competition.”\n\n\nHe went on to explain three things that are needed for markets to function properly: Markets or platforms need to provide thickness, which brings large numbers of buyers and sellers together. They need to make it safe for participants to reveal and act on confidential information they may hold. And they need to manage congestion, or competition and complexity, that arises from thickness.\n\n\nIn one of his early studies, Eric von Hippel found that 77 percent of the most important innovations in scientific instruments over four decades were developed by scientists using these instruments, and not by the scientific instrument companies.\n\n\nDietmar Harhoff confirmed von Hippel’s claim that users are the most important source of knowledge for innovations across all major technologies.18 User innovators are by definition close to their\n\n\nDietmar Harhoff confirmed von Hippel’s claim that users are the most important source of knowledge for innovations across all major technologies.\n\n\nOpen innovation is best suited for well-defined problems. You won’t get very useful insights by organizing a challenge around a broad and vague question such as “What is the future of banks?”\n\n\nUS Congress in response to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska: During cleanup, the oil-water mixture they extract from the ocean and put on barges becomes very thick and viscous in subarctic temperatures. When the barges try to unload this oil-water mixture at the shore, the process becomes very difficult and slow. As one\n\n\nChains are able to reduce inventory by 15 percent, increase order fill rates by 20 percent or more, increase revenues by 2 percent on average,\n\n\nIn the four years since its roll out, ORION has eliminated 1.6 million hours of truck idling time, and has produced an annual savings of 85 million miles in driving and 8.5 million gallons in fuel consumption.\n\n\nAs Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has often said, the goal of a company should be to remove friction for consumers, and technology should be used to do exactly that.\n\n\nGrowth is a key priority for every business, and acquiring new customers is a major driver of growth.\n\n\nYet most companies track a host of short-term metrics to assess their marketing campaigns—impressions, number of clicks, click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (from clicks to purchase), and customer acquisition cost (CAC). Of all these, CAC often becomes the key metric for managers when evaluating the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and when allocating budgets.\n\n\nAccording to the familiar 80-20 rule, 20 percent of the customers provide 80 percent of the revenue. However, research shows that if we focus on profitability instead of revenues, the rule would be 200-20, where 20 percent of the customers provide almost 200 percent of the profit!\n\n\n“The best brands consistently win two moments of truth. The first moment occurs at the store shelf, when a consumer decides whether to buy one brand or another. The second occurs at home, when she uses the brand—and is delighted, or isn’t.”\n\n\nIn 2011, Google coined the term “zero moment of truth” (ZMOT) to reflect the importance of this period of online searching before consumers show up in a store or make an online purchase.\n\n\nIn a Google study 84 percent of shoppers claimed that ZMOT shaped their decisions of which brand to buy.\n\n\nFor decades marketing textbooks have talked about the four Ps (or 4Ps): product, price, place (distribution), and promotion (or advertising).\n\n\nAdvertising people love advertising, but everyone else hates advertising.\n\n\n“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don’t know which half.” This quote, attributed to John Wanamaker, a department-store magnate in the nineteenth century, highlights a constant challenge for marketing executives.\n\n\nThe CEO of Coke in China told me a few years ago that he created a teen advisory board where he invited a few teenagers every quarter to help him get a deep understanding of their media consumption and buying behavior.\n\n\nFirst, it is very time consuming.

His strategy was to risk his lead ships in order to break the coherence of his enemy’s fleet. With coherence lost, he judged, the more experienced English captains would come out on top in the ensuing melee. Good strategy almost always looks this simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain.\n\n\nSimply being ambitious is not a strategy. In 2008, Lehman Brothers ended its 158 years as an investment bank with a crash that sent the global financial system into a tailspin.\n\n\nBad strategy tends to skip over pesky details such as problems.\n\n\nThe purpose of this book is to wake you up to the dramatic differences between good strategy and bad strategy and to give you a leg up toward crafting good strategies.\n\n\nA good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.\n\n\nBad strategy is more than just the absence of good strategy. Bad strategy has a life and logic of its own, a false edifice built on mistaken foundations.\n\n\nJobs about his approach to turning Apple around. He explained both the substance and coherence of his insight with a few sentences: The product lineup was too complicated and the company was bleeding cash. A friend of the family asked me which Apple computer she should buy. She couldn’t figure out the differences among them and I couldn’t give her clear guidance, either. I was appalled that there was no Apple consumer computer priced under $2,000. We are replacing all of those desktop computers with one, the Power Mac G3. We are dropping five of six national retailers—meeting their demand has meant too many models at too many price points and too much markup.\n\n\nMost complex organizations spread rather than concentrate resources, acting to placate and pay off internal and external interests. Thus, we are surprised when a complex organization, such as Apple or the U.S. Army, actually focuses its actions. Not because of secrecy, but because good strategy itself is unexpected.\n\n\nHalf of what alert participants learn in a strategy exercise is to consider the competition even when no one tells you to do it in advance.\n\n\nFirst used in grocery supermarkets, bar-code scanners at retail checkout stations are now ubiquitous. Mass merchandisers began to use them in the early 1980s. Most retailers saw the bar-code scanner as a way of eliminating the cost of constantly changing the price stickers on items. But Wal-Mart went further, developing its own satellite-based information systems. Then it used this data to manage its inbound logistics system and traded it with suppliers in return for discounts.\n\n\n“A full-line discount store needs a population base of at least 100,000.” I repeat his phrase, “The Wal-Mart store needs to be part of the network,” while drawing a circle around the word “store.” Then I wait. With luck, someone will get it. As one student tries to articulate the discovery, others get it, and I sense a small avalanche of “ahas,” like a pot of corn kernels suddenly popping. It isn’t the store; it is the network of 150 stores. And the data flows and the management flows and a distribution hub. The network replaced the store. A regional network of 150 stores serves a population of millions! Walton didn’t break the conventional wisdom; he broke the old definition of a store. If no one gets it right away, I drop hints until they do.\n\n\nUse your relative advantages to impose out-of-proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you.\n\n\nPost-WWII period, the Soviet Union murdered upward of 20 million people, its own citizens and others under its control, a grisly improvement over the 40 million executed, purposefully starved, and worked to death in the 1917–48 period.\n\n\nTo detect a bad strategy, look for one or more of its four major hallmarks: • Fluff. Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses “Sunday” words (words that are inflated and unnecessarily abstruse) and apparently esoteric concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking. • Failure to face the challenge. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it. • Mistaking goals for strategy. Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles. • Bad strategic objectives. A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are “bad” when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.\n\n\nThe scandal took its auditor, Arthur Andersen, down as well. (The accountant’s consulting arm, Andersen Consulting, was renamed Accenture.) A systematic market for trading bandwidth has yet to develop.\n\n\nIf you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen.\n\n\nDARPA’s strategy is more than a general direction. It includes specific policies that guide its everyday actions. For example, it retains program managers for only four to six years to limit empire building and to bring in fresh talent. The expectation is that a new program manager will be willing to challenge the ideas and work of predecessors. In addition, DARPA has a very limited investment in overhead and physical facilities in order to prevent entrenched interests from thwarting progress in new directions.\n\n\nA strategy is like a lever that magnifies force. Yes, you might be able to drag a giant block of rock across the ground with muscles, ropes, and motivation. But it is wiser to build levers and wheels and then move the rock.\n\n\nStrategic objectives should address a specific process or accomplishment, such as halving the time it takes to respond to a customer, or getting work from several Fortune 500 corporations.\n\n\nNorthwest. His planning committee’s strategic plan contained 47 “strategies” and 178 action items. Action item number 122 was to “create a strategic plan.” As another example, the Los Angeles Unified School District’s strategic plan for “high-priority schools” (discussed on the next page) contained 7 “strategies,” 26 “tactics,” and 234 “action steps,” a true dog’s dinner of things to do. This pattern is all too common in city, school district, and nonprofit strategy work, as well as in some business firms. Blue-Sky Objectives The\n\n\nThe second form of bad strategic objectives is one that is “blue sky.” A good strategy defines a critical challenge. What is more, it builds a bridge between that challenge and action,\n\n\nBy contrast, a blue-sky objective is usually a simple restatement of the desired state of affairs or of the challenge. It skips over the annoying fact that no one has a clue as to how to get there.\n\n\nWhen a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance.\n\n\nOne would hope that the experience of North Korea would have cured people of the idea that forcing everyone to believe in and value the same things is the road to high performance.\n\n\nBad strategy flourishes because it floats above analysis, logic, and choice, held aloft by the hot hope that one can avoid dealing with these tricky fundamentals and the difficulties of mastering them.\n\n\nFirst, if one has a policy of resolving conflict by adopting all the options on the table, there will be no incentive for anyone to develop and sharpen their arguments in the first place.\n\n\nThe kernel of a strategy contains three elements: 1. A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical. 2. A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis. 3. A set of coherent actions that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.\n\n\nGreat deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.\n\n\nA guiding policy creates advantage by anticipating the actions and reactions of others, by reducing the complexity and ambiguity in the situation, by exploiting the leverage inherent in concentrating effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect of the situation, and by creating policies and actions that are coherent, each building on the other rather than canceling one another out.\n\n\nAn important duty of any leader is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem\n\n\nTo concentrate on an objective—to make it a priority—necessarily assumes that many other important things will be taken care of.\n\n\nA system has a chain-link logic when its performance is limited by its weakest subunit, or “link.” When there is a weak link, a chain is not made stronger by strengthening the other links.\n\n\nQuality matters when quantity is an inadequate substitute.\n\n\nConversely, the excellence achieved by a well-managed chain-link system is difficult to replicate.\n\n\nIt is often said that a strategy is a choice or a decision. The words “choice” and “decision” evoke an image of someone considering a list of alternatives and then selecting one of them. There is, in fact, a formal theory of decisions that specifies exactly how to make a choice by identifying alternative actions, valuing outcomes, and appraising probabilities of events.\n\n\nThe lesson I took from systems engineering at JPL was that performance is the joint outcome of capability and clever design.\n\n\nA very powerful resource position produces profit without great effort, and it is human nature that the easy life breeds laxity. It is also human nature to associate current profit with recent actions, even though it should be evident that current plenty is the harvest of planting seasons long past.\n\n\nPeople tend to be more myopic than economic theory would suggest.\n\n\nCrown hasn’t given up its bargaining power like the captives have.”\n\n\nAs Frank Gilbreth pointed out in 1909, bricklayers had been laying bricks for thousands of years with essentially no improvement in tools and technique.5 By carefully studying the process, Gilbreth was able to more than double productivity without increasing anyone’s workload. By moving the supply pallets of bricks and mortar to chest height, hundreds or thousands of separate lifting movements per day by each bricklayer were avoided. By using a movable scaffold, skilled masons did not have to waste time carrying bricks up ladders. By making sure that mortar was the right consistency, masons could set and level a brick with a simple press of the hand instead of the time-honored multiple taps with a trowel.\n\n\nExtending an existing competitive advantage brings it into new fields and new competitions.\n\n\nThe simplest form of transition is triggered by substantial increases in fixed costs, especially product development costs.\n\n\nBell Labs; the inventor of the transistor, the C programming language, and Unix;\n\n\nInertia by proxy disappears when the organization decides that adapting to changed circumstances is more important than hanging on to old profit streams.\n\n\nEntropy is a great boon to management and strategy consultants. Despite all the high-level concepts consultants advertise, the bread and butter of every consultant’s business is undoing entropy—cleaning up the debris and weeds that grow in every organizational garden.\n\n\nCall this a hump chart. Whenever you can assign profit or gain to individual products, outlets, areas, segments, or any other portion of the total, you can build a hump chart.\n\n\nYou will also glimpse almost every building block of good strategy: intelligent anticipation, a guiding policy that reduced complexity, the power of design, focus, using advantage, riding a dynamic wave of change, and the important role played by the inertia and disarray of rivals.\n\n\nGood strategy is built on functional knowledge about what works, what doesn’t, and why. Generally available functional knowledge is essential, but because it is available to all, it can rarely be decisive\n\n\nThis is the centerpiece of scientific thinking—the idea of refutation. Unless an idea can possibly be proved false by observable fact, it is not scientific.\n\n\nStarted, became a living experiment. One of the most important resources a business can have is valuable privileged information—that is, knowing something that others do not.\n\n\nBeing strategic is being less myopic—less shortsighted—than others. You must perceive and take into account what others do not, be they colleagues or rivals. Being less myopic is not the same as pretending you can see the future.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/The-Art-of-Business-Value":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/The-Art-of-Business-Value","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Strategy/The Art of Business Value.md","title":"The Art of Business Value","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","business","business-communications","money","value-proposition"],"content":"The Art of Business Value\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIt is a book that wants to define the concept of Business Value in the context of software mostly. It also delves into the different ways of working and how it affects business value.\n🎨 Impressions\nBusiness value is a very abstract concept. Sometimes it is money, sometimes other things.\nOne point to mention is that we do not know what is business value, we assume that it is something and therefore most of the business value and business cases are a hypothesis.\nI liked the book but as business value, it is also a bit vague.  Sometimes I felt like there was too much talk about frameworks such as agile rather than defining or methods to define business value.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nTo those who are deploying code. We can talk all we want about business value, but they are the ones creating it.\n\n\nIt didn’t make much difference to us in a Waterfall world—we cared about schedule and cost milestones. But in Agile practice, we only care about the delivery of business value. Which means we care about … what?\n\n\nA core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software development projects should seek to maximize business value.\n\n\nDevOps, in a sense, is about setting up a value delivery factory—a streamlined, waste-free pipeline through which value can be delivered to the business with a predictably fast cycle time.\n\n\nThe thirteenth “elephant in the room,” according to Kruchten, is that business value is “mentioned everywhere, but not clearly defined, or pushed onto others to resolve.”\n\n\n“the product owner is responsible for making sure the project earns a good return on the investment made in it.”\n\n\nThe Problem: business value, critical but elusive, remains at large. Our first set of clues leads nowhere.\n\n\nFirst learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak. Epictetus, The Discourses\n\n\nFamily-run businesses account for 70–90 percent of global GDP.\n\n\nAny notion of business value as NPV, SVA, or ROI would have had them divest the business. The moral of the story is that, as the owners of the company, they had the right to declare business value to be anything they wanted. It was their company!\n\n\n*Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor and a leading authority on competitive dynamics, argues that there are really just three generic competitive strategies a business can adopt: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.\n\nTo pursue a cost leadership strategy, the company focuses all of its efforts on keeping its costs lower than those of its competitors.\nA differentiation strategy requires that the company provide something that is considered unique across the industry—design, brand image, feature set, technology, or dealer network, for example.\nWith a focus strategy, the company zeros in on a particular target market or geographical area and serves it better than the competitors.\n\n\n\nThe product owner must be a single person with authority over all questions of value. “For the product owner to succeed,” according to Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the founders of Scrum, “the entire organization must respect his or her decisions.”\n\n\nRies is suggesting that the business does not even know what will generate business value; instead, it entertains a series of hypotheses about value and then attempts to confirm or disprove them, arriving at a finer and finer understanding throughout the process.\n\n\nEach problem that I solved became a rule, which served afterwards to solve other problems. René Descartes, Discourse On Method\n\n\nLarge organizations tend to steer toward bureaucracy as a way to maintain standards of behavior. Hating bureaucracy is a bit like hating the law of entropy. It is simply a fact, a method of imposing order on chaos (okay, that makes it the opposite of entropy). That doesn’t mean that there isn’t much to hate about poor bureaucracy or poor uses of bureaucracy.\n\n\nSchein also points out that a normal part of organizational growth is the creation of rules and paperwork to make up for the loss of face-to-face contact.\n\n\nSine ira et studio—that is, “without anger or bias.”\n\n\n“Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally the exercise of control on the basis of knowledge.”\n\n\nThe Rules: we stumble upon a number of rituals conducted by the organization. From where did these practices emerge? Could this be yet another clue?\n\n\n“In high-performance organizations today,” he says, “people who design, build, and run software-based products are an integral part of the business. They are given—and accept—responsibility for customer outcomes.”\n\n\nAt last I will devote myself sincerely and without reservation to the general demolition of my opinions. René Descartes, Meditations On First Philosophy\n\n\nBusiness value is not a simple formula somehow known by the business. It shouldn’t be confused with customer value or user value. High-level business goals like “maximizing shareholder value” must still be interpreted into concrete formulations of business value. These concrete interpretations of business value are not always explicit and often must be discovered. Bureaucracy and culture seem to contain clues to what the organization values.\n\n\nThe Waterfall model was based on taking a point-in-time snapshot of the information we know and using it to create a long-term plan that we would adhere to. The Agile insight was that we should change our notion of what features will create business value over time as more information becomes available and, in fact, that it can be worth an investment even just to increase learning, thereby reducing uncertainty and opening a space in which innovation can occur.\n\n\n“Self-organizing teams do not just happen, they need the right environment. The organization is responsible for supporting the team development by creating the conditions needed for teams to succeed.”\n\n\n*In his textbook on managerial accounting, Charles Horngren identifies five techniques used to incorporate risk into investment decisions:\n\nInsist on a shorter payback period\nIncrease the discount rate\nReduce projected cash flows by a percentage\nPerform a sensitivity analysis\nUse probability weightings of different cash flow scenarios to derive an “expected” outcome\n\n\n\nCost of Delay was introduced by Donald Reinertsen in his book Product Development Flow. In order to demonstrate that organizations should invest in reducing lead times in the product development process, Reinertsen proposes calculating the cost of delaying the introduction of features into production\n\n\nThe greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution. Bertrand Russell (perhaps apocryphal\n\n\nTreat the Enterprise Architecture as an asset with economic business value, both realized and latent. The latent value is something like a real option.\n\n\nContinuous Delivery creates almost a “calculus” of smaller and smaller batches, with correspondingly smaller risk as individual units.\n\n\nIn To Sell is Human, Daniel Pink reports that his studies show that people who are in non-sales positions actually spend about 40 percent of their time at work engaged in sales activities: persuading, convincing, and influencing people.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/The-Strategist-Handbook":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Strategy/The-Strategist-Handbook","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Strategy/The Strategist Handbook.md","title":"The Strategist Handbook","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","strategy","business","business-transformation"],"content":"The Strategist Handbook\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is a very practical introduction to company strategy, and how to execute strategy.  It is for the consultants, managers and planners who define and execute a strategy.\n🎨 Impressions\nA strategy must be clear and communicated again and again and again until it is as ingrained in the culture that everyone knows it.\nExecution is everything.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nLikewise, the Greek term strategos, a compound of the Greek words stratos (army) and agos (leader), refers to a leader or commander of an army.\n\n\nThe most prevalent descriptions of “strategic planning” characterize it as the process by which an organization differentiates itself from its competition to achieve its desired mission and goals\n\n\nA mission answers the question: what do we do as an organization? Awell-designed mission statement defines the company’s primary, distinctive purpose, setting the firm apart from other similar organizations.\n\n\nVision. A clear organizational vision answers the question: where are we going as an organization?\n\n\nThe clear and concise vision of General Electric, during the tenure of former CEO Jack Welch, was: “We will be either number 1 or 2 in any business we are in.”\n\n\nValues. A firm’s values answer the question: who are we as an organization? Organizational values refer to beliefs about standards of behavior organizational members should exhibit\n\n\nWhile strategy addresses how a firm will deliver on its mission, achieve its goals, and reach its vision, tactics answer the question: how will we execute our strategy? Therefore, tactics are a subset of a particular strategy.\n\n\nStrategy is the one you can implement. No matter how brilliant or elegant a strategy is, it is worthless until effectively implemented.\n\n\nRobert Behn (2003) of Harvard University identifies eight key benefits of effective performance measurement: Evaluation. How well is the department, business unit, or overall organization performing? Control. How can we ensure management and employees are doing the right thing? Budgeting. In which programs, people, or projects should we invest? Motivation. How can we prompt line staff, middle managers, and collaborators to do what is necessary to improve performance? Promotion. How can we demonstrate to stakeholders and the media we are doing a good job? Celebration. What accomplishments are worthy of celebrating success? Learning. What is working or not working? Improvement. In what areas do we need to focus our improvement efforts?\n\n\nHenry Mintzberg (1987) argued that strategic planning is an analytical process with a business plan as its outcome.\n\n\nAs Matzler and colleagues state, “Most managers would be unable to work effectively if they couldn’t rely on their ability to extract relevant information from the many reports and charts they are confronted with daily. Thanks to their experience, skilled managers can ‘read between the lines’ and recognize patterns, rather than consider all possible information in detail”\n\n\nUse data to mitigate personal bias. Although intuition plays a role in the strategy process, and, depending on the organization, often a prominent role, those working on the strategy process should guard against intuition turning into detrimental bias.\n\n\nThe senior team to make the case for why a particular proposed strategy should not be pursued can help moderate any management biases and/or groupthink that may occur, helping management to genuinely think through the rationale for and validity of each proposed strategy.\n\n\nSenior team to make the case for why a particular proposed\n\n\nAssign a “devil’s advocate.” A person assigned within the senior team to make the case for why a particular proposed strategy should not be pursued can help moderate any management biases and/or groupthink that may occur, helping management to genuinely think through the rationale for and validity of each proposed strategy.\n\n\nAt its core, strategy is about predicting the future.\n\n\nAccording to two different studies (McGahan and Porter, 1997; Rumelt, 1991), in developed economies, company characteristics have about three times more impact on profitability than industry factors. However, in emerging economies, company characteristics have over twenty times more impact than either industry or country factors\n\n\nConducting a Five Forces analysis provides data that feeds into the external “OT” (Opportunities and Threats) elements of a SWOT analysis, helping management understand where a firm fits in the industry landscape, how it currently competes within the industry, and how it might position itself in the future. In a follow-up piece to his original Five Forces article, Porter (2008) emphasized that understanding the overall industry structure as well as the competitive forces at play is a vital element of effective strategic decision-making to develop an effective competitive organizational strategy.\n\n\nConsequently, almost two decades after Porter’s seminal article, Brandenburger and Nalebuff (1996) introduced the concept of a “sixth force” they called “complementors,” which provide products and services that are best used in conjunction with a product or service from another provider.\n\n\nFads. Common in the fitness, clothing, food, and beauty products industries. A fad is something that quickly becomes popular and often disappears just as quickly, often lasting a year or less\n\n\nFads are short in duration and often narrow in scope, trends last longer and their scope is broader, whereas megatrends are enduring, take years to progress, and impact the entire world.\n\n\nThe PESTEL framework examines key external factors beyond industry dynamics across six categories (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal), which can also contribute to the external “OT” (Opportunities and Threats) elements of a SWOT analysis.\n\n\nA common definition of a trend is the identification of societal changes and developments.\n\n\nPotential pitfalls of external strategic analysis include no prioritization of data, one-off analysis, using qualitative information only, analysis paralysis, and relying on management intuition only.\n\n\nBetween resources and competencies. On the one hand, “resources” are what firms have and can be segmented into four categories (physical, financial, human, and organizational). On the other hand, “competencies” (which are often also called “capabilities”) are what firms do and can also be segmented into the same four categories\n\n\nSegmented into four categories (physical, financial, human, and organizational). On the other hand, “competencies” (which are often also called “capabilities”) are what firms do and can also be segmented into the same four categories\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, it is useful to differentiate between resources and competencies. On the one hand, “resources” are what firms have and can be segmented into four categories (physical, financial, human, and organizational). On the other hand, “competencies” (which are often also called “capabilities”) are what firms do and can also be segmented into the same four categories\n\n\nThreshold competencies are required to compete in the industry, provide competitive parity, are essential for organizational survival, and are possessed by many competitors. Meanwhile, distinctive competencies are required to win in a competitive market, provide competitive advantage, create organizational success, and are possessed by one or just a few firms in the market\n\n\nThe value chain model (Porter, 1985) is an end-to-end view of an organization’s operational and support activities. A firm’s operational activities along their value chain can include sourcing raw materials, manufacturing and production, logistics and distribution, marketing and sales, and after-sales service. A firm’s support activities can include human resources, information technology, finance, procurement, legal, accounting, and tax, among others.\n\n\nThe VRIO framework (Barney, 1995) consists of four key criteria about a resource or capability to determine its strategic value to the organization: Value: Does the resource/capability enable the firm to improve its efficiency or effectiveness? Rarity: Is control of the resource/capability in the hands of one or only a few firms? Inimitability: Is it difficult for other firms to imitate, and will there be significant cost disadvantages to a firm trying to obtain, develop, or duplicate the resource/capability? Organization: Is the firm organized in such a way that it is ready and able to exploit the resource/capability?\n\n\nKey characteristics that make resources inimitable are: Complexity. The resource consists of internal and external linkages. An example is an auto manufacturer’s supplier network and embedding those suppliers into the firm’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Ambiguous. It is difficult for other firms to discern the characteristics and linkages of the resource. A firm’s superior customer service process that blends skilled service personnel with an automated customer management system and a service-oriented organizational culture is an example of an ambiguous resource. Historical. The resource is built over time. A firm’s reputation for providing high-quality and long-lasting products is an example of a resource that is built over time. Cultural. The resource is embodied in the firm’s culture, such as a culture of innovation that enables the firm to regularly offer new products and services.\n\n\nIn any strategy process (whether dynamic or traditional), analytical data (both formal and intuitive) informs the potential strategies management identify and the strategic choices they make.\n\n\nThese analyses provide answers to two key strategic questions: Where and what are the largest and most likely future external developments and market opportunities? What internal resources do we have, and might we need, to take advantage of the future developments and market opportunities identified?\n\n\nKeep the list of priority strategies short. Identifying a shortlist (e.g., three to five) of priority strategies for implementation enables management and the broader organization to allocate sufficient resources and attention to each strategic priority.\n\n\nPATH Framework. Yet another alternative to the market entry profile map and the CAGE Distance Framework to assess a country’s market attractiveness is the PATH Framework. The four dimensions of the framework are: political, which includes governmental policies, political stability, corruption, and regulation administrative, covering trade agreements, currency, legal system, and visa and work permit requirements transportation and infrastructure, encompassing ports, roads, telecommunications, and internet access human resources, including demographics, cost of labor, workforce skills and education, and labor laws.\n\n\nCAGE Distance Framework. An alternative to the market entry profile map is the CAGE Distance Framework (Ghemawat and Siegel, 2011), which can be used to ascertain differences or “distances” between countries across four dimensions that companies should address when identifying and implementing international strategies. The four dimensions of the framework are: cultural, which includes language, customs, values, norms, work systems, traditions, religion administrative, including trade agreements, colonial ties, currency, legal system, governmental policies, political hostility, visa and work permit requirements, and corruption geographic, involving physical distance, common land borders, time zones, transportation, and communication economic, composed of per capita income, cost of labor, availability of human resources, and economic size.\n\n\nFor example, a survey of senior executives from 197 companies worldwide, with sales exceeding $500 million, found that companies typically lose well over a third (37 percent) of their strategies’ potential value because of poor execution.\n\n\nConsequently, the process of strategy execution needs to be a management priority. To make this point, Oxford Professor Thomas Powell compares strategy execution to climbers of Mount Everest who, “must consider strategy execution, both during the climb and while planning the climb … Success in climbing Everest does not depend on choosing the right path, but on the climber’s capacity to deal with the conditions of the actual climb”\n\n\nTwo key activities have a major impact on building and maintaining momentum for successful strategy execution: visible “quick wins” and continuous communication.\n\n\nInitially implementing quick-win actions—those that can be put in place within thirty to sixty days of execution launch—demonstrates early progress. The quick wins should be closely followed by staggered implementation of medium-term (six to twelve months) and long-term (one year and beyond) actions.\n\n\nDiscounting the value of regular strategy execution tracking and reporting. The adage of what gets measured gets managed applies to any strategy execution effort. Regular tracking of both progress against milestones of the implementation plan and results achieved throughout the implementation process is essential\n\n\n*Seven fundamentals of transformation management facilitate the process:\n\nApply defined, clear implementation leadership\nAddress “me” issues quickly\nProvide extensive communication\nEnsure a focus on customers\nMake tough decisions\nCreate focused initiatives\nManage resistance at every level\n\n\n\nToo often, management who should be “transformation champions” opt for playing politics instead of providing visible leadership to the organization. This tendency only makes it more difficult for people to get resolution of their “me issues” described below that generate so much uncertainty and low morale across the workforce. When\n\n\nToo often, management who should be “transformation champions” opt for playing politics instead of providing visible leadership to the organization. This tendency only makes it more difficult for people to get resolution of their “me issues” described below that generate so much uncertainty and low morale across the workforce.\n\n\nConsequently, the foremost topic to become a matter of great concern among the workforce at all levels of the organization, from executives to front-line employees, is personal uncertainty, their “me issues.”\n\n\nThis finding is supported by Longo (1996), who notes, in writing about the difficulty of transformation efforts, “the number one source of difficulty with implementation is the disregard for, or misunderstanding of, the resistance to transformation”\n\n\nIt’s true that resistance can be irrational and self-serving. But like it or not, it is an important form of feedback. Dismissing it robs you of a powerful tool as you implement transformation. It takes a strong leader to step up and engage when a transformation effort meets with pushback. If you can gain understanding, and learning from behaviors you perceive as threatening, you will ultimately deliver better results.\n\n\nAlthough the situation is shifting, many MBA programs and management training courses still focus primarily on the “hard” (technical, operational, financial, and analytical) aspects of business, dealing only in a cursory way with organizational transformation. As a result, management training does a poor job of addressing how to work through resistance encountered during major strategic transformation efforts. Another reason is that managers’ practical experience during the strategy formulation process, often with a particular focus on analytics, merely serves to reinforce their training and education while undermining their ability to gain a sound understanding of why and how people resist transformation during implementation and what to do about it.\n\n\n“How do you bring people into the transformation process? Start with reality. Get all the facts out. Give people the rationale for transformation, laying it out in the clearest, most dramatic terms. When everybody gets the same facts, they’ll generally come to the same conclusion. Only after everyone agrees on the reality and resistance is lowered can you begin to get buy-in to the needed changes.”\n\n\nThe top two reported obstacles faced during major organizational changes were employee resistance and communication breakdown.\n\n\nThe Johari Window (Luft and Ingham, 1955) is a well-established model of building effective one-to-one interpersonal communication that can be applied to an organizational context, helping management develop and deliver effective strategic communications. The Window was originally developed to improve individual interpersonal interactions by assessing the ways in which people give and receive information.\n\n\nMake communication a priority. Unfortunately, management often view transformation communications as a side issue or they delegate it to others. However, management must communicate early and often, and overtly participate in transformation communications.\n\n\nWhen people are let go from an organization, the employees that stay are just as attentive to how the process of separation is being handled as are the exiting employees. The people remaining in the organization, the survivors, view the handling of separations as a clear indicator of the value management places on the workforce.\n\n\nAccording to the McKinsey Global Innovation Survey, 84 percent of executives identified innovation as a strategic priority crucial to firm growth, but only 6 percent are satisfied with their organization’s innovation performance\n\n\nLeverage the “multiplier effect.” Make the whole cultural alignment effort greater than the sum of its parts (1+1=3) by implementing half or more of the twelve cultural levers.\n\n\nExamples of strategic advantages that can be either limited or enhanced by the company’s nonmarket operating environment include: Cost: cost-saving mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) can be blocked or approved by competition or national security regulators. Growth: growth-creating M&amp;As can be blocked or approved by competition or national security regulators. First mover: approved patents allow firms to be first to market. Sole provider: approved patents allow firms to be the only provider in the market. Demand: products made of rare or endangered species are banned by regulators. Complement: software firms are not allowed to bundle operating systems and browsers.\n\n\nIA3 framework (Bach and Allen, 2010). The IA3 framework can help understand and analyze firm-specific nonmarket issues. The IA3 framework consists of six questions: What is the issue? Various issues include intellectual property, health and safety, emissions and fuel standards, trade policy, consumer protection, competition policy, diversity and inclusion, and so forth. Who are the actors? Nonmarket actors include governments, NGOs, activists, and the media. What are the actors’ interests? Various actors may be interested in equality, safety, sustainability, financial gain, and so on. In what arena to the actors meet? Nonmarket arenas can include the press, online forums, rallies, elections, and so forth. What information moves the issue? Nonmarket information can include research, position papers, expert opinion, emotion, and so on. What assets do the actors need to prevail? Nonmarket assets can include political power, funding, band equity, networks, and so forth.\n\n\nNonmarket strategy is a term applied to the aspects of business strategy that address relationships that do not unfold within commercial markets but still affect the company’s ability to reach its strategic goals.\n\n\n“Regulatory risk” and “reputational risk” have been ranked as top strategic risks by executives.\n\n\nThe issue lifecycle consists of: issue identification, interest formation, legislation, administration, and enforcement.\n\n\n*Positioning each business unit on the matrix identifies four categories of businesses in a corporate portfolio:\n\nDogs. Business units with low market share and low growth rates are candidates for divestment.\nCash cows. Business units in the portfolio with high market share but low growth are ideal to maintain and harvest the cash flows, which can be used to fund investment in other portfolio businesses.\nQuestion marks. Portfolio businesses with high growth rates but low market share. Corporate management must decide whether to invest in these business units to grow their market share.\nStars. Businesses in the portfolio with high market share and high growth. These are business units that corporate management will continue to invest in to become even more dominant in their industries.\n\n\n\nAnsoff’s matrix. Used by business unit management to identify growth opportunities (market penetration, new products, new services) and corporate management to identify opportunities to add businesses to the corporate portfolio.\n\n\nBCG matrix. Used to assess the business unit portfolio of a corporate conglomerate to identify opportunities for investment, divestments, maintenance, or additions to the portfolio.\n\n\nMergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) are ubiquitous terms that include a spectrum of arrangements including non-equity alliances and partnerships, equity alliances, joint ventures, and M&amp;As, each with increasing ownership.\n\n\nManagement agendas of companies, there are generally two types. “Social activists” are primarily concerned with influencing a firm’s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) agenda, whereas “financial activists” principally focus on creating greater returns to a firm’s shareholders.\n\n\nFinancial activists are most often hedge funds that take small but relatively significant stakes in firms, typically around 5 percent of outstanding shares (The Economist, 2015). Upon buying a small but relatively significant portion of a firm’s shares, an activist then tries to influence management’s agenda by gaining other shareholders’ support for their demands, which often include representation on the company’s board, cost-cutting, selling of underperforming assets, and returning cash to shareholders.\n\n\nIn general, shareholder activism creates returns above benchmarks. For example, the average activist hedge fund gained 8.76 percent in the first quarter of 2021 versus the average hedge-fund industry gain of 6 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index gain of 5.8 percent (Herbst-Bayliss, 2021).\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/The-Alchemy-of-Air":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/The-Alchemy-of-Air","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/The Alchemy of Air.md","title":"The Alchemy of Air","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review"],"content":"The Alchemy of Air\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the chemistry and development of modern fertilizers.

Their hatred and their pettyness.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nNature offers only two ways of fixing nitrogen, getting it out of the air and into living systems: those special bacteria on the roots of peas, beans, and a few other plants, and bolts of lightning.\n\n\nToday we’re above six billion and counting. If we all ate simple vegetarian diets and farmed every acre of arable land as wisely as possible using the best techniques of the late 1800s, the earth could support a population of around four billion people.\n\n\nFertilizer and explosives are very close in structure—so close that one can often be used for the other.\n\n\nWithout Haber-Bosch, historians say, Germany would have run out of arms and surrendered two years earlier than it did in World War I.\n\n\nFarben’s first director, Carl Bosch, led me into the story. I learned quickly that he was a man of contradictions: a business mogul who won a Nobel Prize and an ardent anti-Nazi who founded and led a most infamous Nazi firm.\n\n\nThe Romans worshipped a god of manure, Stercutius.\n\n\nEvery few years the Chinese made sure to rotate in a crop of soybeans; chickpeas were the crop of choice in the Middle East, lentils in India, and mung beans in Southeast Asia; and Europeans used peas or beans or clover. “Oats, peas, beans, and barley grow” was more than a children’s rhyme. It was a timetable for successful farming.\n\n\nEMPTY A BAG of store-bought fertilizer and what pours out is usually a mix of three elements, N, P, and K—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—the three most essential nutrients for plants.\n\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, the recipe had spread across the Middle East to Europe. There they found the same salt—which they called China Snow or nitre—growing on stone walls, especially underground, in basements and crypts. The Romans called it sal petrae (Latin for “salt of stone”).\n\n\nIn England, by royal decree, the king’s saltpeter gatherers—Petermen, they were called—scoured the countryside for the white salt. They quickly became among the nation’s most reviled and feared public officials. Wherever they found saltpeter, the Petermen were warranted to dig it out, regardless of whose property it was on, regardless of the difficulties involved, even if it meant moving a privy, tearing apart a stable, or ripping up the floor of a house. Petermen opened pits, tore down walls, and commandeered carts and horses. They often took bribes.\n\n\nThe mother lode of saltpeter, however, the only natural deposits in the world large enough to feed the gunpowder needs of an entire nation, was discovered in the mud flats of the Ganges in India (where it was believed that a combination of the river water, the hot climate, and the dung of holy cows combined to create a sort of huge natural saltpeter plantation). The British East India Company started shipping it to England by the ton in the mid-seventeenth century—it was one of the company’s most important cargoes—and this vital natural resource made India an especially important target for European colonial expansion.\n\n\nThe end of guano also meant an end to Peru’s easy income. By the 1870s the nation was for all practical purposes bankrupt. About eleven million tons of guano had been gathered, shipped, and spread during the brief guano age.\n\n\nThe Peruvian tradition was one of aristocratic control, slave labor, and resource exploitation. The Chilean tradition was relatively progressive, nationalistic, enterprising, and aggressive.\n\n\nN2 is held together with a triple bond, the strongest chemical bond in nature. Breaking it and freeing the individual N atoms requires enormous amounts of energy, heat on the order of 1,000°C, intense enough to to melt copper.\n\n\nThe only thing in nature hot enough to break apart N2 is a bolt of lightning.\n\n\nBayer had made a fortune off of aspirin, a pain reliever made from coal).\n\n\nThe Germans have a name for the way an inanimate object like a machine can pick the worst possible moment to break down: Tücke des Objekts, “the spite of things.”\n\n\nWhen the deal was signed, BASF was no longer just a chemical firm. It was a defense industry. Bosch did not much like it. His team recognized the irony: They had worked long and hard to feed people; now the same technology was going to be used to kill them. Bosch did not talk about it much, but he felt it. One of Bosch’s top assistants remembered that during the saltpeter negotiations Bosch had referred to “this dirty business.” When the deal was done, he said, he was going to drink himself into “the biggest high of my life.”\n\n\nOver the course of the war, Oppau suffered more from its own repairs (done with inferior wartime steel) and restarts than it did from enemy bombs.\n\n\nOn November 9, 1918, without an enemy ever crossing its border, Germany surrendered. One-tenth of its prewar population was dead.\n\n\nThe growing popularity of Hitler and his Nazis worried Bosch. The Nazis were bad for business. Their inflammatory politics would bring back the anti-German feelings that Bosch and others had tried so hard to ameliorate after the war. Their race-based rhetoric—especially their anti-Semitism—was anathema to Bosch, a man who had spent his career working with Jewish scientists and businessmen.\n\n\nPlanck remembered Hitler saying that he was more concerned with communists than Jews. The problem, Hitler explained, was that “Jews are all communists. A Jew is a Jew… . They all cling together like burrs.” The only answer to the problem was to proceed against them all. When Planck tried to return to his point about science, the chancellor began talking faster and louder, pounding his hand on his knee, flying into a rage so fierce that the elderly Planck had to leave the room. Some time passed before he recovered emotionally.\n\n\nIf Jews were so important to physics and chemistry, Hitler said, “Then we’ll just have to work one hundred years without physics and chemistry!”\n\n\nBosch was stunned. He told friends later that Hitler seemed to go into a sort of trance when he was excited, like a man lost in a dream.\n\n\nBosch had said about the Haber-Bosch ammonia process, “I have often asked myself whether it would have been better if we had not succeeded. The war perhaps would have ended sooner with less misery and on better terms. Gentlemen, these questions are all useless. Progress in science and technology cannot be stopped. They are in many ways akin to art. One can persuade the one to halt as little as the others. They drive the people who are born for them to activity.”\n\n\nAs Leuna (and the other German synthetic gasoline factories targeted by the Allies) slowly began failing, Germany began starving for fuel. The Luftwaffe was especially hard hit. Pilot training was cut back because there was no fuel. Speer heard reports of air fields where trained flyers had only enough fuel to get into the air every third day. The army began suffer as well. Speer told his government of a column of 150 German military trucks in Italy being pulled by oxen.\n\n\nStill, the demand for their products is so great that Haber-Bosch plants today consume 1 percent of all the energy on earth, and the largest factories produce so much ammonia that it has to be transported in pipelines (one of the first ammonia pipelines in the United States, built in the late 1960s, for instance, runs from the plant in Texas to the corn fields of Iowa).\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Consulting/Secrets-of-Consulting":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Consulting/Secrets-of-Consulting","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Work/Consulting/Secrets of Consulting.md","title":"Secrets of Consulting","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","consulting","management","stakeholder-management","psychology","organizations","advisor","advertising","consulting/sales","consulting/reflections","consultancy","consulting/client-relationship","consulting/engagements","consulting/client"],"content":"Secrets of Consulting\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA book about what is required of consultants. It has a lot of rules on how to engage with your clients and what they want.  Consulting is about influencing people who ask for it.\n🎨 Impressions\nThere is always a problem.\nThe laws on pricing and advertising is good. THere is much to learn from just reading this book.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nIf you are a consultant, or if you ever use a consultant, this book is for you. That’s a wide scope, because nowadays, nearly everyone is some kind of a consultant.\n\n\nMy definition of consulting is the art of influencing people at their request. People want some sort of change—or fear some sort of change—so they seek consulting, in one form or another.\n\n\n*Most of the time, though, I enjoyed the direct interaction with my clients, if I could stand the irrationality. If I wanted to stay in the business, it seemed to me I had two choices:\n\nRemain rational, and go crazy.\nBecome irrational, and be called crazy. For many years, I oscillated between these poles of misery, until I hit upon a third approach:\nBecome rational about irrationality.\n\n\n\nThe First Law of Consulting: In spite of what your client may tell you, there’s always a problem. The Second Law of Consulting: No matter how it looks at first, it’s always a people problem. The Third Law of Consulting: Never forget they’re paying you by the hour, not by the solution.\n\n\nA corollary of The First Law of Consulting is The Ten Percent Promise Law: Never promise more than ten percent improvement. Most people can successfully absorb ten percent into their psychological category of “no problem.” Anything more, however, would be embarrassing if the consultant succeeded.\n\n\nAnother corollary is The Ten Percent Solution Law: If you happen to achieve more than ten percent improvement, make sure it isn’t noticed.\n\n\nA corollary of The Second Law of Consulting is one of Marvin’s Laws: Whatever the client is doing, advise something else. At the very least, the people problem is either lack of imagination or lack of perspective. People who are close to a problem tend to keep repeating what didn’t work the first time.\n\n\nNever Forget They’re Paying You by the Hour The Third Law of Consulting could be interpreted to mean that the consultant should milk the client for as much hourly money as possible,but that’s not what it’s about. Many good consultants have tried to get paid by the solution, but none to my knowledge has ever succeeded.\n\n\nThe Third Law of Consulting actually reminds the consultant that if the clients had wanted a solution, they would have paid for a solution. Deep down, people want to be able to say to their management, “Look, we realize that there is a problem, and we are working on it. We have retained a consultant.”\n\n\nIn short, managers may not be buying solutions, but alibis to give their management.\n\n\nYou’ll never accomplish anything if you care who gets the credit. In order for a consultant to get credit, the client would have to admit there had been a solution. To admit there was a solution, the client would have to admit there was a problem, which is unthinkable. As a result, the only consultants who get invited back are those who never seem to accomplish anything.\n\n\nWhen the clients don’t show their appreciation, pretend that they’re stunned by your performance—but never forget that it’s your fantasy, not theirs.\n\n\nThe same contradiction applies to anyone who calls upon a consultant. Indeed, you could define “consultant” as “someone who helps you solve problems you think you should be able to solve by yourself.”\n\n\nTherefore, hiring a consultant is always seen as an admission of personal failure. A consultant who fails to solve the problem would thus be interpreted as a personal success for the client—except that the client hired the consultant in the first place, and so the consultant’s failure still falls on the client.\n\n\nIf they didn’t hire you, don’t solve their problem. The Fourth Law of Consulting says you must never allow yourself to forget that consulting is the art of influencing people at their request. Among consultants, the most prevalent occupational disease is offering unsolicited “help.”\n\n\nUntil recently, I suspected that the entire field of psychology was fifty percent error and fifty percent fake.\n\n\nMost of the time, for most of the world, no matter how hard people work at it, nothing of any significance happens.\n\n\nDani and I did eventually publish an entire book on the subject of why Weinbergs’ Law prevails. It’s called General Principles of Systems Design.\n\n\nOnce you eliminate your number one problem, number two gets a promotion. As a consultant, I often get so involved in my clients’ problems, that I begin to believe I could actually rid them of problems once and for all.\n\n\nIf you can’t accept failure, you’ll never succeed as a consultant. This is truly a hard law, yet expressed in inverse form, it offers an atom of hope: Some people do succeed as consultants, so it must be possible to deal with failure. So what keeps successful consultants going, even when they fail?\n\n\nHelping myself is even harder than helping others.\n\n\nDon’t be rational; be reasonable.\n\n\nPeople who think they know everything are easiest to fool. When they do trip, these consultants try to cover themselves with high-sounding rationalizations. They seem to believe that their lack of humor will be interpreted as rationality.\n\n\nThe business of life is too important to be taken seriously.\n\n\nPoisoning, which affected their brains; hence, the expression “mad as a hatter.”\n\n\nHatters in the 19th century were subject to mercury poisoning, which affected their brains; hence, the expression “mad as a hatter.”\n\n\nMany years ago, Sir Ronald Fisher noted that every biological system had to face the problem of present versus future, and that the future was always less certain than the present. To survive, a species had to do well today, but not so well that it didn’t allow for possible change tomorrow.\n\n\nHis Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection said that the more adapted an organism was to present conditions, the less adaptable it tended to be to unknown future conditions. We can apply the theorem to individuals, small groups of people, large organizations, organizations of people and machines, and even complex systems of machinery, and can generalize it as follows: The better adapted you are, the less adaptable you tend to be.\n\n\nWe can do it—and this is how much it will cost. I use the test every day. Whenever I want a service performed, I tell them what I want, they tell me how much it will cost to get it from them, and I decide whether it’s worth it to me.\n\n\nIn short, the consultant studies history because, as the economist Kenneth Boulding says, Things are the way they are because they got that way.\nThis rule is so important to consultants that I’ve given it a special name, Boulding’s Backward Basis. Any time you’re on a new consulting assignment and need to become acquainted with the situation in a hurry, try using Boulding’s Backward Basis.\n\n\n*If you loudly castigate the people who were responsible for producing the present mess, you may then discover that\n\nThere were, at the time, good and sufficient reasons for decisions that seem idiotic today.\nThe person most responsible is now your client, or your client’s manager. For these and other reasons, when you apply Boulding’s Backward Basis, you should remember Sparks’s Law of Problem Solution: The chances of solving a problem decline the closer you get to finding out who was the cause of the problem.\n\n\n\nMy father always warned me: We may run out of energy, or air, or water, or food, but we’ll never run out of reasons.\n\n\nNowadays, the primary method I use for reducing the flood of facts is The Five-Minute Rule: Clients always know how to solve their problems, and always tell the solution in the first five minutes.\n\n\nIf you can’t think of three things that might go wrong with your plans, then there’s something wrong with your thinking.\n\n\nWhat you don’t know may not hurt you, but what you don’t remember always does.\n\n\n*One of the books advised me that the next time I pigged out, I should think the following thoughts:\n\nRemember that a lapse does not have to mean a relapse.\nResist negative thoughts.\nAsk yourself what happened; then plan your strategy for next time.\nReturn to controlled eating immediately.\nTalk to someone supportive.\nRemember that you are making lifelong changes. You are not on a diet. Look at the progress you’ve made, and go to it.\n\n\n\nOver the years, I’ve come to believe that the effectiveness of jiggling is governed by one simple law: Less is more.\n\n\nThe best way to lose something is to struggle to keep it.\n\n\nThe biggest and longest lasting changes usually originate in attempts to preserve the very thing that ultimately changes most.\n\n\nWinston Churchill once remarked that he was happy he wasn’t a radical in his youth, so he wouldn’t turn out to be a reactionary in his old age. As people grow older, they learn about how change works, which could easily cause them to be discouraged.\n\n\nThe Edsel, it turns out, was Ford’s way of taking care of all their better ideas in the 1950’s. Consultants and other fanatics with new ideas are dangerous to the established order, so why not put them all in one place, out of harm’s way. That approach guarantees that even if each of the individual ideas is terrific, the result will be a debacle. As a consultant, I’ve seen this approach to avoiding change many times since my Edsel days, but never with such refinement. No backup system in the world, no series of defenses, will protect you from failure in the type of situation that produced the Edsel. Only preventive medicine might have helped, so let’s honor that noble antique by naming one preventive bit of advice The Edsel Edict: If you must have something new, take one, not two.\n\n\nEvery consultant complains about resistance, but if you think resistance is bad, consider the alternative: It’s frightening to encounter a client who doesn’t resist your ideas, because that places the full responsibility on you to be correct at all times.\n\n\nResistance is like fungus. It doesn’t thrive in daylight. Therefore, once you suspect that there is resistance, your next step is to get it out in the open, rather than let it fester in the dark.\n\n\n“Resistance” is the consultant’s label. To the client, it is “safety.” People do things because they think they will gain more than they will lose. They resist when they perceive a negative balance. Generally, such a balance is composed of many factors, some of which are gains and some are losses. In searching for the source of resistance, I work with the client to make a complete list of both.\n\n\nClients are more important to you than you can ever be to them.\n\n\nNever let a single client have more than one fourth of your business.\n\n\n“To be able to say yes to yourself as a consultant, be able to say no to any of your clients.”\n\n\nThe best marketing tool is a satisfied client.\n\n\nSpend at least one-fourth of your time doing nothing. By “nothing” I mean that you should not be doing anything that is billable to any client, you should not be out getting exposure, and you should not be doing administrative work at the office. Whatever else you do with that time is your own choice, and is the egg that makes you love my advice.\n\n\nA consultant can exist in one of two states: State I (idle) or State B (busy).\n\n\n*Here, then, is a review of the first nine laws of marketing:\n\nA consultant can exist in one of two states: State I (idle) or State B (busy).\nThe best way to get clients is to have clients.\nSpend at least one day a week getting exposure.\nClients are more important to you than you can ever be to them.\nNever let a single client have more than one-fourth of your business.\nThe best marketing tool is a satisfied client.\nGive away your best ideas. 8. It tastes better when you add your own egg.\nSpend at least one-fourth of your time doing nothing.\n\n\n\nPricing has many functions, only one of which is the exchange of money.\n\n\nWhen I set a fee, there are two possibilities: One is that the client will accept it, I’ll do the work, and I’ll be paid that fee; the other is that the client will reject it, I won’t do the work, and I won’t get that fee. The Ninth Law says that I should set the fee so that whatever happens, I’ll feel more or less the same.\n\n\n*The pricing laws:\n\nPricing has many functions, only one of which is the exchange of money.\nThe more they pay you, the more they love you. The less they pay you, the less they respect you.\nThe money is usually the smallest part of the price.\nPricing is not a zero-sum game.\nIf you need the money, don’t take the job.\nIf they don’t like your work, don’t take their money.\nMoney is more than price.\nPrice is not a thing; it’s a negotiated relationship.\nSet the price so you won’t regret it either way. If you examine these laws, you’ll realize that they don’t talk about rationality, but emotionality.\nIn other words, underlying all the other laws of pricing is The Tenth Law: All prices are ultimately based on feelings, both yours and theirs.\n\n\n\n“Cutting the cards” takes care of the clients’ mistakes (or my mistakes in listening), but what if the clients really are lying? What if they are really trying to mislead me? Because I never rely on the ability of a single person to give me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about a complex situation, lying presents no real problem. I routinely check any important fact from several different directions, so unless the entire organization is lying, generally arrive at a true picture in the end. If my final picture seems to contradict what someone told me, I always try to go back to that person and say, “In my notes, I recorded that you said thus-and-so, but from other sources I’ve found this-and-that. Can you help me reconcile the difference?”\n\n\nFowler once told me that he took a course on contracts in which the professor said there were only three very important rules to remember: First, get it in writing. Second, get it in writing. Third, get it in writing. I believe that every consultant should memorize these rules. Fowler did, but there is more to the matter than Fowler understood.\n\n\nBolton, Robert.

Many people assume they are better at winning trust than they really are.\n\n\nTrust can be earned by the simplest of gestures. David has a dentist, named Andrew, who, early in the relationship, recommended that David permit him to perform various procedures on his teeth. Like many clients, David was not sure whether Andrew was recommending additional procedures because they were really needed or because he was just trying to increase his revenues\n\n\nAt its core, trust is about relationships.\n\n\nMany professionals approach the task of giving advice as if it were an objective, rational exercise based on their technical knowledge and expertise.

What exactly are you afraid of? Sometimes we’re afraid of saying something because we think it will put the business at risk. But if we’re honest, we often find what is at risk isn’t the business itself, it is our own personal comfort with expanding the bounds of intimacy.\n\n\nENGAGEMENT, THE FIRST STEP in trust building, is the stage where it first occurs to the client that maybe, perhaps, somehow, the person standing here in front of him or her might be able to help in finding a solution to a (specific) problem. This can happen in either a new or existing client situation.\n\n\nOne major consulting firm built its success on a strategy of carefully selecting the target new clients it pursued, and before making even the first contact with the target client, it did a thorough analysis of the industry.\n\n\nA trusted advisor might say, “What I like about your idea is X; now help me understand how we can use it to accomplish Y.” Through such language, the advisor constantly lets the client know that the client is respected and that the two of them are free to discuss with great candor the specific merits of the idea at hand.\n\n\nA useful technique for emotional framing is a technique that we call naming and claiming.\n\n\n*Naming and claiming is characterized by three factors:\n\nAn acknowledgment of the difficulty of raising the issue\nAn acceptance of the responsibility for raising it\nA direct statement of the issue itself*\n\n\n\nTrust is enhanced by the advisor’s openness and candor.

Most jobs have a job title like “Consultant” or “Accountant”\n\n\nA career path is a series of jobs in succession. For example, a typical career path for a Software Developer might be something like this: Jr. Developer → Developer → Sr. Developer → Team Lead\n\n\nMost companies are structured so that each job has a paygrade or payband that describes the lower and upper ends of the pay range for that particular job.\n\n\nPromotions happen when you move up to the next job in your career path, and it usually represents a jump to a higher paygrade as well.\n\n\nRaises are when you move to a higher salary. This may mean just moving “up” (to the right, toward the top of the paygrade) in your current paygrade, or it could mean moving into a higher paygrade and moving “up” within that new paygrade.\n\n\nFor example, the reason you shouldn’t give the first number in a salary negotiation is that you don’t know what your potential employer’s paygrades look like. But they know what their paygrades look like, and they probably have to offer you something in an appropriate paygrade.\n\n\nMost companies (especially in the United States) frown upon openly discussing salaries. This is partly why: if you know what your peers—people doing your job, at your company, in your geographic region—are making, then you have a pretty good sense of what you should be making too.\n\n\nFinally, you need to be prepared to answer the following two-part question: “So where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?”\n\n\nIt’s best if you do not disclose either your current salary or your desired salary during the interview process.\n\n\nMy pat answer to the “what are you looking for” part of the dreaded salary question is, “I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.”\n\n\nMake sure you show up early so that you’re waiting on Andy to begin. Never keep your interviewer waiting—there are few faster ways to make a very bad first impression. Odds are that Andy has just left a meeting, or ended a client call, or scarfed down his lunch so he could make sure you get started on time. If you’re late, he’ll be frustrated right out of the gate. Frustrated people aren’t likely to recommend their frustrators for jobs.\n\n\nTake a notebook and a pen. Don’t make a big show of it, but take some notes during your conversation. You may want those notes later, and it looks more professional. (Yes, this is basically just acting. You should still do it.) Make sure to bring multiple copies of your résumé, printed on good paper with good ink.\n\n\nIt’s generally okay to send a follow-up email to someone who interviews you, but calling them is a little too personal.\n\n\nThe interview is two opportunities in one. It’s an opportunity to pitch yourself and convince a company to hire you, and it’s an opportunity for you to determine whether you really want to do a particular job for a particular company.\n\n\nMost people don’t get many job offers, and they see them as special snowflakes that come along only a few times in a lifetime. This reverence for new jobs spills over into the negotiation process, so they treat negotiations very gingerly, afraid to jeopardize them.\n\n\nMost recruiters make job offers all the time, and they tend to see everything as numbers—the candidate has an applicant ID, the job requisition has a number, the paygrade for the job is just a range of numbers. If they can get a good candidate at a good salary, that’s a good day for them.\n\n\nIt’s not just numbers to you because the outcome of this negotiation will affect your life.\n\n\nThe numbers have real meaning to you, so you have far more skin in the game than the recruiter.\n\n\nFight for as much money as you can get because this is your final chance to maximize your pay before you’re in the door, confined by the rules for raises and promotions inside the company.\n\n\nJust like the interview process, the salary negotiation process generally looks very similar across companies. Here’s what the process usually looks like: Preparation Post-interview follow-up Initial offer\n\n\nHere’s what the process usually looks like: Preparation Post-interview follow-up Initial offer Your counter Preparing for the final discussion Final discussion\n\n\nYou have two main objectives before you begin negotiating: Understand why you are a valuable candidate for this job Determine the minimum salary you require to do this job\n\n\nThis is a ballpark number that you’ll keep private. It’s one metric for measuring your success in this negotiation. It represents what you think you’ll get without using what you learn in this chapter. Think of it like this: This ballpark figure is what you’d answer if someone surprised you right after you sent your first application to the company by asking, “If they offered this job to you right now, what do you think they’d pay you?”\n\n\nA good range for a counter is between 10% and 20% above their initial offer.\n\n\nFirst, let’s set a baseline for raise sizing: Small raise: 1% Normal raise: 2-3% Good raise: 4-7% Big raise: 8%\n\n\nHis answer was, “I look for people that are already working in and exploring areas outside their own, and I promote them.” In other words, he was looking for people already doing the jobs he needed to fill.\n\n\n“How do you find the people that you promote to be your VPs and SVPs?” I wanted to know the secret sauce for finding untapped potential, for identifying future superstars so that I could get promoted myself, and so that I too would know how to find talent. His answer was, “I look for people that are already working in and exploring areas outside their own, and I promote them.” In other words, he was looking for people already doing the jobs he needed to fill.\n\n\nReal talk: You may not need most of the remaining information in this chapter to get a nice raise. Your best ammo is the market mid-point data, augmented with a general sense of how you stack up against an “average” employee doing your job.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Jobs/The-Job-Closer":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Jobs/The-Job-Closer","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Work/Jobs/The Job Closer.md","title":"The Job Closer","links":["Working/Job-Searching/Job-Searcing"],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review","job-searching/interview","job-searching/resume","job-searching"],"content":"The Job Closer\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about CVs, resumes, interviews, and negotiating. It is sharp, to the point, and concise.

Starting right now, write down every job that you think you would enjoy doing and could feasibly be or become qualified for one day\n\n\nTIARA is a program designed to help individuals build relationships and influence others. It stands for Trust, Interest, Attention, Recognition, and Appreciation. The program uses a simple framework to guide individuals in building rapport and establishing trust with others through a series of questions that focus on the other person’s interests and experiences. By doing so, the program helps individuals turn strangers into advocates and potential mentors in a short amount of time.\n\n\nHowever, now I want you to start a habit of reading mindfully, so that whenever you read about an organization doing interesting work, you make a note of that organization’s name and sector, since it is a potential employer.\n\n\nTo that end, the Odyssey Planning exercise consists of first creating a plausible five-year plan for yourself and rating that plan based on four metrics: enjoyment, resources, confidence, and personal coherence. Then, the process is followed by…a twist so delicious I wouldn’t dare spoil it here. My students at Duke have loved this exercise for years now, and I think you would enjoy it too.\n\n\nThey found that on average hiring managers spent six seconds per resume.\n\n\nManagers’ attention during that time period was focused on the following information. Candidate name Employer name(s) Job title(s) Dates of employment Schools attended\n\n\nSpecifically, they found that 80 percent of hiring managers’ attention during that time period was focused on the following information. Candidate name Employer name(s) Job title(s) Dates of employment Schools attended\n\n\nCan you spot what they have in common? If not, let me help. Hiring managers spent 4.8 out of those six seconds looking at things you can’t change!\n\n\nEasy-to-defend candidates, not perfectly worded bullets—at least in their initial passes through a stack of resumes.\n\n\nEasy-to-defend candidates are the only ones who are “found” through online job postings, and even then, there’s no guarantee.\n\n\nOn any matter where everyone agrees, that information should absolutely be perfect. For resumes, this typically includes the following items: Proper spelling Correct grammar Aligned margins Internally consistent formatting (for example, when mentioning a range of years, don’t use 2022-23 in one place and 2022–2023 in another) Single font used throughout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatBasic resumeGood resumeGreat resumeFormattingError-freeError-freeError-freeBullet SourceJob descriptionAnnual review”Greatest hits”Bullets Describe Your…ResponsibilitiesMajor projectsImpact (and root causes, if any)Results Are…Not addressedProvided when quantitativeAlways provided\n\n\nResumes continue to be heavily emphasized because they give job seekers two critical perverse incentives.\n\n\n“Your job search will probably take you about a hundred hours; your resume should take no more than three of them.” I call this Ed’s Three-Hour Rule.\n\n\nPerverse incentives are an economic term for situations in which desired actions have undesirable results.\n\n\nPerverse incentives are an economic term for situations in which desired actions have undesirable results. Perverse incentives are also sometimes referred to as the cobra effect,\n\n\nAn accomplishment statement is a description of the impact you made with the responsibilities you held, rather than just the responsibilities themselves. This is the key factor that differentiates Good and Great Resumes from Basic Resumes.\n\n\nResponsible for refrigerated biscuit marketing budget of 400 million (BASIC RESUME) Analyzed advertising channels to optimally allocate 400 million marketing budget (GOOD RESUME) Optimized $400 million marketing budget by analyzing historical returns and increasing budget to highest-return channel (newspaper inserts), increasing profits by 22 percent (GREAT RESUME)\n\n\nThe good news is that cover letters are far more interesting than resumes. They illustrate how well you can construct an argument (when responding to the question “Why should we consider you?” specifically).\n\n\nImagining that this cover letter is an email to our boss’s boss. It’s going to be short, to the point, authentic, customer-focused, error-free, and done.\n\n\nRAC (Reason-Anecdote-Connection) Model, a framework we’ll use again later during interviews to answer “Why?” questions (like “Why our company?” or “Why this role?”).\n\n\nEssentially, a RAC Letter is a five-paragraph cover letter with an introductory paragraph, three RAC paragraphs in which you systematically detail why you think you’d be a good fit, and a short closing paragraph asking for an interview and providing contact info.\n\n\nIn almost all cases, a cover letter is accompanied by your resume. That is where your accomplishments are listed.\n\n\nUse your cover letter to tell readers what your resume means to them. Interpret it for them, as you would your findings from a project\n\n\nThey need a nickname because of their sheer predictability and the fact that 60 percent of interview decisions are made by the time an interviewer has asked them, according to a 2015 study of 691 interviews by Frieder, Van Iddekinge, and Raymark.  Note: Which nickname? TMAY most likely.\n\n\nSo, 5 percent of interviewers will make decisions on candidates within the first minute, based on their first impression.\n\n\nAnother 25 percent make up their mind between the first and fifth minute, the period when small talk is usually covered, perhaps with a transition to TMAY. Again, just a statement of fact: three in ten interviews are decided based only on first impressions, small talk, and (possibly) TMAY.\n\n\nAn additional 30 percent make up their minds between the fifth and fifteenth minute. This is typically the time when the Big Four get asked. Thus, 60 percent of interviews are decided based only on first impressions, small talk, and the Big Four.\n\n\nThey are the four interview questions you are most likely to get at the start of your interviews, namely: Tell me about yourself (TMAY). Why this job? Why our organization? Why this sector/industry?\n\n\nWhile many of us have taken speech classes at some point in our education or careers, woefully few of us have taken listening classes.\n\n\nFIT (Favorite part-Insight gained-Transition made) will help you maintain all the goodwill and rapport you developed during the small talk and quickly catch them up on how you ended up here with them in this moment.\n\n\nThere’s even a Latin phrase for this concept, omne trium perfectum—roughly translated, “every set of three is complete.”\n\n\nThe Ready-to-Eat recognizes that most projects in any profession follow a standard process of three Actions: Understand the challenge. Brainstorm solutions. Implement the best solution(s).\n\n\nIt’s a CAR story with a Takeaway (the T in CART) added at the end. Takeaways are unifying thoughts added to the end of CAR stories when you revisit the original question and very explicitly explain how your story answers that question.\n\n\nIt’s a common joke among and about strategy consultants that they will often start answers in a Rule of Three format (as in “There are three main reasons why…”) while having only two reasons in mind, but with full confidence that they’ll think of a third reason by the time they’re done talking. (I’m no exception; old habits die hard!\n\n\n“The biggest thing I’ve learned about effective communication is to think like your audience before choosing what to say. What information will the buyers—not their bosses, nor Wall Street, nor the consultants—find most compelling?\n\n\nThe peak-end rule states that people rate an experience based on a combination of two moments—the experience’s most intense moment and the final moment of the experience—rather than an average of every moment of the experience.\n\n\n“When will I hear back regarding my status in this process?” This question is for you. I can’t even tell you how many times I have seen job seekers panic for days, weeks, and even months after an interview because they failed to ask this one simple question.\n\n\nI recommend making this question either a rapport-building question, an expensive question (again, that’s my term for a question that proves you’ve done your research), or a Research and Rapport (R&amp;R) question that offers the best of both worlds. The general formula for an R&amp;R question is “I read about [relevant trend in this employer’s space] in [reputable source]. Has that impacted you and your work? If so, how?”\n\n\nThere’s a concept called commitment and consistency that psychologist Robert Cialdini identified in his 1984 book Influence. In one study he cites, he found that bystanders who verbally agreed to watch a fellow beachgoer’s things intervened to prevent a (simulated) robbery 95 percent of the time, whereas bystanders who gave no verbal commitment intervened just 20 percent of the time.\n\n\nFor some interviewers, the thank-you note means nothing; for others, it means a lot. Remember that nearly a quarter of interviewers (22.5 percent) make up their minds after the interview.\n\n\nIn negotiation terms, the “because” is a show of good faith that you’re not engaging in arbitrary positional bargaining; there are real reasons underlying your request for more, and it’s a signal to the employer that you would like the same—for them to provide the reasons why, if they choose to decline your request.\n\n\nIt consists only of doing a brain dump of all the pros and cons of accepting an offer so they are out of your head and into a list. Add to this list throughout the day as more pros and cons come to mind. This isn’t about seeing whether accepting the offer has more pros rather than cons; it’s more about offloading them, ensuring that you do not constantly cycle through them one at a time in your head all day or, equally bad, forget one or more of them.\n\n\nHowever, despite the power of coffee chats and weekly manager meetings to help keep your path to full-time employment and/or advancement on track, they are both widely underutilized and woefully underdiscussed.\n\n\nCoffee chats are informational meetings that you’d conduct once you’re on board at a new employer.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Money/Personal-MBA":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Money/Personal-MBA","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Work/Money/Personal MBA.md","title":"Personal MBA","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","personal-finance","economics","finance","management"],"content":"Personal MBA\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nA book with small but interesting stories and lessons.

Value Creation. Discovering what people need or want, then creating it. 2. Marketing. Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created. 3. Sales. Turning prospective customers into paying customers. 4. Value Delivery. Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied. 5. Finance. Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile.\n\n\nThe competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.\n\n\nThe zealous display the strength of their belief, while the judicious show the grounds of it.\n\n\nA Service involves helping or assisting someone in exchange for a fee.

Iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better; the faster you learn, the more quickly you’ll be able to improve.\n\n\n*Assuming the promised benefits of the offering are appealing, there are nine common Economic Values that people typically consider when evaluating a potential purchase. They are:\n\nEfficacy—How well does it work?\nSpeed—How quickly does it work?\nReliability—Can I depend on it to do what I want?\nEase of Use—How much effort does it require?\nFlexibility—How many things does it do?\nStatus—How does this affect the way others perceive me?\nAesthetic Appeal—How attractive or otherwise aesthetically pleasing is it?\nEmotion—How does it make me feel?\nCost—How much do I have to give up to get this?\n\n\n\nIn the book Trade-Off: Why Some Things Catch On, and Others Don’t, Kevin Maney discusses these common values in terms of two primary characteristics: convenience and fidelity.\n\n\nThings that are quick, reliable, easy, and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal, or emotional impact are high-fidelity.\n\n\nThings which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least. —JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, NINETEENTH-CENTURY DRAMATIST, POET, AND POLYMATH\n\n\nIt is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong. —JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES, ECONOMIST\n\n\nIf you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. —REID HOFFMAN, FOUNDER OF LINKEDIN\n\n\nAny engineer that doesn’t need to wash his hands at least three times a day is a failure.\n\n\nAdvertising is the tax you pay for being unremarkable\n\n\nDiscovering where Probable Purchasers start looking for information after crossing the interest threshold is extremely valuable.\n\n\nPeople always hate to lose.

When your investment pays off, Leverage helps it pay off more. When your investment tanks, you lose more money than you would otherwise.\n\n\nSunk Costs are investments of time, energy, and money that can’t be recovered once they’ve been made. No matter what you do, you can’t get those resources back.\n\n\nChange the structure of your Environment, and your behavior will change automatically. Add a bit of Friction (discussed later) or eliminate certain options completely, and you’ll find it much easier to focus on what you’re trying to accomplish.\n\n\nA great example of Guiding Structure is the “Sterile Cockpit Rule” that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted in 1981. Most airline accidents happen below ten thousand feet, where distractions can be deadly. Above ten thousand feet, pilots can talk about anything they want, but below ten thousand feet, the only discussion permitted is about information directly related to the flight in progress. By eliminating distractions, the Sterile Cockpit Rule reduces errors and accidents.\n\n\nIf you don’t want to slip, don’t go where it’s slippery. —ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MAXIM\n\n\nTo simulate this challenging environment, Mackworth created the “Mackworth Clock,” a device designed to test how well people pay attention over time. The “clock” featured a second hand that worked like a normal clock, with a twist—it would randomly skip a second, ticking two notches instead of one. The test subject’s job was to press a button every time they noticed the skip. Here’s what Mackworth found: after ten minutes of staring at the clock, the quality of the subject’s attention went down dramatically. The maximum period of sustained attention even highly motivated operators (who were given substantial bonuses for performance) were able to sustain was thirty minutes—any longer, and they’d inevitably zone out.\n\n\nProperly, “monoidealism” is simply the state in which you have exactly one thing on your mind, with no conflicts.\n\n\nSo how exactly do you get yourself into a Monoideal state? First, eliminate potential distractions and interruptions. Depending on the level of cognitive activity required to complete your work, it’ll take ten to thirty minutes before your mind becomes absorbed in what you’re doing. Phone calls, coworkers “dropping by to pick your brain,” and other unanticipated demands on your Attention will break your Monoideal state, so priority number one is ensuring that you don’t get distracted. I often use earplugs or play instrumental music to eliminate background noise, and disconnect the phone when I don’t want to be interrupted. Turning off my Internet connection (see Willpower Depletion) while I’m writing also makes it much easier for me to maintain a Monoideal state. Otherwise, I’m way too likely to browse the Web when the going gets tough. Using similar Guiding Structure techniques is a good way to prevent your Attention from straying. Second, eliminate inner Conflicts. Sometimes it’s difficult to get started because you’re experiencing a Conflict between two control systems in your mind. Eliminating these Conflicts before you start working helps you achieve a Monoideal state much more quickly.\n\n\nHere’s an example of how I use Priming: in the book 10 Days to Faster Reading, Abby Marks-Beale recommends a technique I refer to as purpose setting: taking a few minutes before you start reading to figure out (1) why you want to read this material and (2) what kind of information you’re looking for. Jotting down a few notes before picking up the book reinforces exactly what you’re looking to find.\n\n\nSelf-Elicitation is the practice of asking yourself questions, then answering them. By asking yourself good questions (or working with someone who asks good questions), you can grasp important insights or generate new ideas very quickly.\n\n\nANTECEDENT  • When did it happen? • Whom were you with? • What were you doing? • Where were you? • What were you saying to yourself ? • What thoughts were you having? • What feelings were you having? BEHAVIOR • What were you saying to yourself ? • What thoughts did you have? • What feelings were you having? • What actions were you performing? CONSEQUENCES  • What happened as a result? • Was it pleasant or unpleasant?\n\n\nFor small tasks, use what I call Ingvar’s Rule—assume each task will take no more than ten minutes to complete, then begin. This includes meetings and phone calls: for some reason, the default time period for meetings is an hour—whether you need it or not.\n\n\nI haven’t been wrong since 1961, when I thought I made a mistake. —BOB HUDSON, POLITICIAN\n\n\nThey explain the “Dunning-Kruger effect” as follows: 1. Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skill. 2. Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others. 3. Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy. 4. If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level, these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill. People who are “unconsciously incompetent” don’t know they’re incompetent\n\n\nR&amp;D exists because it works—companies that make Research and Development a priority often discover new products to offer their customers or process improvements that meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. If it works for them, it can work for you.\n\n\nCommunication Overhead is the proportion of time you spend communicating with members of your team instead of getting productive work done.\n\n\nDr. Michael Sutcliffe of the University of Cambridge1 has proposed “8 Symptoms of Bureaucratic Breakdown” that appear in teams suffering from Communication Overhead: 1. The Invisible Decision—No one knows how or where decisions are made, and there is no transparency in the decision-making process. 2. Unfinished Business—Too many tasks are started but very few are carried through to the end. 3. Coordination Paralysis—Nothing can be done without checking with a host of interconnected units. 4. Nothing New—There are no radical ideas, inventions, or lateral thinking—a general lack of initiative. 5. Pseudo-Problems—Minor issues become magnified out of all proportion. 6. Embattled Center—The center battles for consistency and control against local/regional units. 7. Negative Deadlines—The deadlines for work become more important than the quality of the work being done. 8. Input Domination—Individuals react to inputs—i.e., whatever gets put in their in-tray—as opposed to using their own initiative.\n\n\nAl Switzler recommend using the STATE model to communicate without provoking anger or defensiveness: 1. Share your facts—Facts are less controversial, more persuasive, and less insulting than conclusions, so lead with them first. 2. Tell your story—Explain the situation from your point of view, taking care to avoid insulting or judging, which makes the other person feel less safe. 3. Ask for others’ paths—Ask for the other person’s side of the situation, what they intended, and what they want. 4. Talk tentatively—Avoid conclusions, judgments, and ultimatums. 5. Encourage testing—Make suggestions, ask for input, and discuss until you reach a productive and mutually satisfactory course of action.\n\n\nCommander’s Intent is a much better method of delegating tasks: whenever you assign a task to someone, tell them why it must be done. The more your agent understands the purpose behind your actions, the better they’ll be able to respond appropriately when the situation changes.\n\n\nHumans naturally tend to form distinct groups, a process called Clanning.\n\n\nThe Pygmalion Effect is a tendency named after the protagonist of a Greek myth. Pygmalion was a gifted sculptor who created a statue of a woman so perfect that he fell in love with his creation. After Pygmalion desperately prayed to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, she took pity on him by bringing the statue to life. The Pygmalion Effect explains why all of our relationships are, in a very real sense, self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\n\nHere’s Gall’s Law : all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked.\n\n\nThe performance of a System is always limited by the availability of a critical input. Eliminate the Constraint, and the system’s performance will improve.\n\n\n“Theory of Constraints”: any manageable system is always limited in achieving more of its Goal by at least one Constraint.\n\n\nBalancing Loops dampen each system cycle’s output, leading to system equilibrium and resistance to change. Think of dropping a tennis ball from shoulder height: it’ll bounce up and down, each bounce smaller than the last. Friction and air resistance dampen each cycle until the energy in the system reaches equilibrium and the ball sits at rest upon the ground.\n\n\nAutocatalysis is a concept that comes from chemistry: it’s a reaction whose output produces the raw materials necessary for an identical reaction.\n\n\nTightly coupled systems are typically time dependent, rigidly ordered, and have very little Slack. There’s often only one path to a successful outcome, and a failure in any part of the system can “cascade” to the rest of the system.\n\n\nIf your System relies on other people in order to function, that poses a major risk to the operation of your system.\n\n\nChanging some aspect of a complex system always introduces Second-Order Effects, some of which may be antithetical to the original intent of the change.\n\n\nThe problem is not that there are problems. The problem is expecting otherwise and thinking that having problems is a problem.\n\n\nThe theory of Normal Accidents is a more formal way of expressing a universal proverb: shit happens. In a tightly coupled system, small risks accumulate to the point where errors and accidents are inevitable. The larger and more complex the system, the higher the likelihood that something will eventually go very, very wrong.\n\n\nYou can’t understand it, you can’t change it. —ERI CEVANS, TECHNOLOGIST\n\n\nMeasuring something is the first step to improving it. Peter Drucker famously opined, “What gets measured gets managed.”\n\n\nAnalytical Honesty means measuring and analyzing the data you have dispassionately. Since humans are social creatures, we tend to care deeply about how others perceive us, which gives us a natural incentive to make things look better than they actually are. If your purpose is to actually make things better, this tendency can get in the way of collecting accurate data and conducting useful analysis.\n\n\nSegmentation is a technique that involves splitting a data set into well-defined subgroups to add additional Context.\n\n\nHumanization is the process of using data to tell a story (Narrative) about a real person’s experience or behavior.\n\n\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil. —DONALD KNUTH,\n\n\nElegance is necessarily unnatural, only achievable at great expense. If you just do something, it won’t be elegant, but if you do it and then see what might be more elegant, and do it again, you might, after an unknown number of iterations, get something that is very elegant. —ERIK NAGGUM, COMPUTER PROGRAMMER\n\n\nThe last 10 percent of performance generates one-third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems\n\n\nFriction is any force or process that removes energy from a System over time. In the presence of Friction, it’s necessary to continue to add energy to a system to keep it moving at the same rate over time.\n\n\nEvery business process has some amount of Friction. The key is to identify areas where Friction currently exists, then experiment with small improvements that will reduce the amount of Friction in the system. Removing small amounts of Friction consistently over time Accumulates large improvements in both quality and efficiency.\n\n\nThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency. —BILL GATES, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF MICROSOFT\n\n\nHere’s the Paradox of Automation: the more efficient the Automated system, the more crucial the contribution of the human operators of that system. When an error happens, operators need to identify and fix the situation quickly or shut the system down—otherwise, the Automated system will continue to Multiply the error.\n\n\nCessation is the choice to intentionally stop doing something that’s counterproductive. Due to Absence Blindness, we’re predisposed to attempt to improve a system by doing something—it “feels wrong” to do nothing.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Money/Rich-Dad,-Poor-Dad":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Money/Rich-Dad,-Poor-Dad","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Work/Money/Rich Dad, Poor Dad.md","title":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","links":["tags/books","tags/non-fiction","tags/finance","tags/money","tags/saving"],"tags":["books","non-fiction","finance","money","saving"],"content":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\nTags: books non-fiction finance money saving\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nThis book is about the value of investing, and building assets rather than paying others.

Financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else. Many people will simply have nothing at the end of their working days to show for their efforts.\n\n\nBusinesses that do not require my presence I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job.\n\n\nIt is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to the poor, that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who pays for the poor.\n\n\nIn 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax.\n\n\n“Once government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,” said rich dad. “Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat, and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on opposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The more he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected organization. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my investors.\n\n\nAn employee with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.\n\n\nEvery time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply comply. They react. They have the money, power, and intent to change things. They don’t just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. Instead, they search for ways to minimize their tax burden. They hire smart attorneys and accountants, and persuade politicians to change laws or create legal loopholes. They use their resources to effect change.\n\n\nToday, I am constantly shocked at the number of people who pay more taxes, or take fewer deductions, simply because they are afraid of the government.\n\n\nIf you work for money, you give the power to you employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.\n\n\nFinancial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements which allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business.\n\n\nOne is not better than the other. Yet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.\n\n\nThe problem with “secure” investments is that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.\n\n\n“You want to know a little about a lot” was rich dad’s suggestion.\n\n\n“Leadership is what you need to learn next,” he said. “If you’re not a good leader, you’ll get shot in the back, just like they do in business.”\n\n\nJob is an acronym for “Just Over Broke.”\n\n\nIn the movie Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise, there are many great one-liners. Probably the most memorable is: “Show me the money.” But there is one line I thought most truthful. It comes from the scene where Tom Cruise is leaving the firm. He has just been fired, and he is asking the entire company, “Who wants to come with me?” And the whole place is silent and frozen. Only one woman speaks up and says, “I’d like to, but I’m due for a promotion in three months.”\n\n\nIn his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: “I visited the headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met with a managing director who specializes in designing lush retirement plans for top management.

About 30% of the people thought 10 or fewer flips would do the trick, and roughly half thought that fewer than 30 flips would be enough. Most people, your authors included, are surprised at first that the correct answer is 143 flips, which we think is another indication of just how hard‐wired humans are to draw conclusions from sample sizes that are too small, a behavioral bias termed the “law of small numbers bias.”\n\n\nIf you gave an investor the next day’s news 24 hours in advance, he would go bust in less than a year. —Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\n\nThe optimal bet size, expressed as a fraction of wealth, is directly proportional to the gamble’s expected return, and inversely proportional to its variance and to your personal degree of risk‐aversion.\n\n\nKelly was thinking about the optimal amount of wealth to bet on a binary gamble and concluded, as we did at the beginning of this chapter, that optimizing expected wealth makes no sense. Instead, he proposed optimizing the rate of growth of wealth. He wrote a mathematical expression for the wealth growth rate as a function of the terms of the bet and from that derived a formula for the optimal bet size that maximizes it, which has since become known as the Kelly criterion: where “edge” is the ratio of expected gain to potential loss, and “odds” is the ratio of potential gain to potential loss.g For example, risking 10 to make 30 represents “odds” of 3.\n\n\nStandard deviation captures risk relative to an expected return, not risk of loss, which some believe is the main type of risk investors should care about.\n\n\nStandard deviation does not directly measure the degree to which return distributions are asymmetric or fat‐tailed.\n\n\nBet size is a function of individual risk attitudes (, but should be made consistently across bets with differing attractiveness. Bet size should be proportional to expected gain ( Bet size should be inversely proportional to the square of risk (: if risk halves, bet size should quadruple. We saw how these three characteristics come together to give us an optimal betting rule, the Merton share:\n\n\nThe determination of the value of an item must not be based on the price, but rather on the Utility it yields. —Daniel Bernoulli, Swiss mathematician and gambler (1738)\n\n\nIf people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is. —John von Neumann\n\n\nI’ve been rich and I’ve been poor.

In general, we are not as individually different as we like to think we are.\n\n\nWhen an economist calls you irrational, it almost always means that if you follow through on your stated preferences, a sufficiently clever opponent can take all your money, leaving you smiling along the way.

Learning to relax a bit more about things. Reducing the number of goals to a manageable few. Having just a couple of things in the working-on phase. Everything else is just distractions.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nAssuming you live to be eighty, you’ll have had about four thousand weeks.\n\n\n“Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” the economist John Maynard Keynes made a famous prediction: Within a century, thanks to the growth of wealth and the advance of technology, no one would have to work more than about fifteen hours a week.\n\n\nSt. Anthony’s fire, a form of food poisoning caused by moldy grain, which left the delirious sufferer feeling as though his skin were burning or as if he were being bitten by unseen teeth.\n\n\n“I have by sundry people been horribly cheated,” fumed the iron magnate Ambrose Crowley, from County Durham in England, in a memo from the 1790s, announcing his new policy of deducting pay for time spent “smoking, singing, reading of news history, contention, disputes, anything foreign to my business or in any way loitering.” The way Crowley saw it, his lackadaisical employees were thieves, illegitimately helping themselves to containers from the conveyor belt of time.\n\n\nIt leads to the insight that meaningful productivity often comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take, surrendering to what in German has been called Eigenzeit, or the time inherent to a process itself.\n\n\nHelen Petersen writes in a widely shared essay on millennial burnout, you can’t fix such problems “with vacation, or an adult coloring book, or ‘anxiety baking,’ or the Pomodoro Technique, or overnight fucking oats.”\n\n\nin her book More Work for Mother, the historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan shows that when housewives first got access to “labor-saving” devices like washing machines and vacuum cleaners, no time was saved at all, because society’s standards of cleanliness simply rose to offset the benefits; now that you could return each of your husband’s shirts to a spotless condition after a single wearing, it began to feel like you should, to show how much you loved him.\n\n\n“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion,” the English humorist and historian C. Northcote Parkinson wrote in 1955, coining what became known as Parkinson’s law.\n\n\nThe reason it’s so hard for my wife and me to find an hour in the week for a serious conversation, or for me and my three closest friends to meet for a beer, isn’t usually that we “don’t have the time,” in the strict sense of that phrase, though that’s what we may tell ourselves. It’s that we do have the time—but that there’s almost no likelihood of it being the same portion of time for everyone involved. Free to pursue our own entirely personal schedules, yet still yoked to our jobs, we’ve constructed lives that can’t be made to mesh.\n\n\nOkCupid is an efficient way of finding people to date, but also of being constantly reminded about all the other, potentially more alluring people you might be dating instead.\n\n\nBut smoothness, it turns out, is a dubious virtue, since it’s often the unsmoothed textures of life that make it livable, helping nurture the relationships that are crucial for mental and physical health, and for the resilience of our communities.\n\n\n“When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone,” Wu points out, “waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating.”\n\n\n“It gave me a vital bit of perspective: I happen to be alive, and there’s no cosmic law entitling me to that status.

Once you’ve selected those tasks, all other incoming demands on your time must wait until one of the three items has been completed, thereby freeing up a slot. (It’s also permissible to free up a slot by abandoning a project altogether if it isn’t working out. The point isn’t to force yourself to finish absolutely everything you start, but rather to banish the bad habit of keeping an ever-proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back burner.)\n\n\n*The government of New South Wales, being acutely conscious that big construction projects tend to overrun, allowed a seemingly ample four years for the building of the Sydney Opera House—but it ended up taking fourteen, at a cost of more than 1,400 percent of the original budget.\n\n\nPhilosophers have been worrying about distraction at least since the time of the ancient Greeks, who saw it less as a matter of external interruptions and more as a question of character—a systematic inner failure to use one’s time on what one claimed to value the most. Their reason for treating distraction so seriously was straightforward, and it’s the reason we ought to do so, too: what you pay attention to will define, for you, what reality is.\n\n\nLong after I’d closed the app, I’d be panting on the treadmill at the gym, or chopping carrots for dinner, only to find myself mentally prosecuting a devastating argument against some idiotic holder of Wrong Opinions I’d had the misfortune to encounter online earlier that day. (It wasn’t misfortune really, of course; the algorithm showed me those posts deliberately, having learned what would wind me up.)\n\n\nEven if you quit Facebook, or ban yourself from social media during the workday, or exile yourself to a cabin in the mountains, you’ll probably still find it unpleasantly constraining to focus on what matters, so you’ll find some way to relieve the pain by distracting yourself: by daydreaming, taking an unnecessary nap, or—the preferred option of the productivity geek—redesigning your to-do list and reorganizing your desk.\n\n\nOn the contrary, “surreptitiously checking your phone beneath the dinner table” is what you do because it’s hard to focus on the conversation—because listening takes effort and patience and a spirit of surrender, and because what you hear might upset you, so checking your phone is naturally more pleasant.\n\n\n“Hofstadter’s law,” which states that any task you’re planning to tackle will always take longer than you expect, “even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.”\n\n\nMy paternal grandmother, who was Jewish, was nine years old and living in Berlin when Hitler came to power in 1933, and she was fifteen by the time her stepfather, surveying the wreckage of Kristallnacht, finally made plans to get his family to Hamburg and thence on board the SS Manhattan, bound for Southampton in England. (The passengers, I was once told, popped champagne corks on deck, but only after they were certain the ship had left German waters.)\n\n\n“Do not rule over imaginary kingdoms of endlessly proliferating possibilities.”\n\n\n“Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child.

Later is too late.”\n\n\nOne way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit.\n\n\n“Lawyers imbued with the ethos of the billable hour have difficulty grasping a non-commodified understanding of the meaning of time that would allow them to appreciate the true value of such participation.”\n\n\n“If the satisfaction of an old man drinking a glass of wine counts for nothing,” wrote Simone de Beauvoir, “then production and wealth are only hollow myths; they have meaning only if they are capable of being retrieved in individual and living joy.”\n\n\n“Protestant work ethic,” the German sociologist Max Weber argued that it was one of the core ingredients of the modern soul.\n\n\nFriends of mine live in an apartment building on the historically Jewish Lower East Side of New York that’s equipped with a “Shabbat elevator”: step inside it between Friday evening and Saturday night, and you’ll find yourself stopping at every floor, even if nobody wants to get on or off there, because it’s been programmed to spare Jewish residents and visitors from having to violate the rule against operating electrical switches on the sabbath. (In fact, the actual prohibition, laid down in ancient Jewish law, is against lighting fires, but modern authorities interpret that to include completing electrical circuits. The other thirty-eight categories of banned activities have been interpreted as outlawing everything from inflating water wings at the swimming pool to tearing sheets of toilet paper from a roll.)\n\n\nAs the Cat in the Hat says, “It is fun to have fun but you have to know how.”\n\n\n“Nothing is more alien to the present age than idleness,” writes the philosopher John Gray.

Then one day he came upon a neighbor who was midway through fixing his lawn mower, and paid him a self-deprecating compliment: “Boy, I sure admire you. I’ve never been able to fix those kinds of things!” “That’s because you don’t take the time,” the neighbor replied—\n\n\nI try to remember the cautionary tale of Mario Salcedo, a Cuban American financial consultant who almost certainly holds the record for the number of nights spent aboard cruise ships. There’s little question that Super Mario—as he’s known to the staff of Royal Caribbean Cruises, the firm to which he’s been loyal for most of his two decades, as a resident of the oceans, with the 2020 coronavirus pandemic the only major interruption—is in full control of his time.\n\n\nThey derived psychological benefits not merely from vacation time, but from having the same vacation time as other people. When many were on vacation at once, it was as if an intangible, supernatural cloud of relaxation had settled over the nation as a whole.\n\n\n“Totalitarian movements are mass organizations of atomized, isolated individuals,” wrote Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism.\n\n\nIt’s in the interests of an autocrat that the only real bond among his supporters should be their support for him.\n\n\n“Time is the substance I am made of,”\n\n\nGrowing up, I assumed that the newspaper on the breakfast table must be assembled by people who truly knew what they were doing; then I got a job at a newspaper. Unconsciously, I transferred my assumptions of competence elsewhere, including to people who worked in government. But then I got to know a few people who did—and who would admit, after a couple of drinks, that their jobs involved staggering from crisis to crisis, inventing plausible-sounding policies in the backs of cars en route to the press conferences at which those policies had to be announced.\n\n\n“Your questions are unanswerable, because you want to know how to live.

It goes through a lot of different types of cognitive failures and tries to highlight in a good way how the mind works.\n🎨 Impressions\nVery interesting read, the amount of information we process, and the way we are biologically structured makes understanding and leveraging the mind much more important. We must understand the limitations of the mind, and make sure that those limitations are being diminished by the way we structure our lives.\nOne interesting insight was how organizations are evolved in such a way to represent how they are meant to function. If safety is paramount, lots of hierarchies, if nonlinear innovation is important then maybe a flatter structure?\nUnderstanding how things such as lack of sleep and alcohol affect our mind makes it important to be aware of those things and how they affect you.\nAnother organization rule that I thought was interesting is having an unlabeled type of folder, for things you don’t know how to label.\nMaybe we should all take a page out of Marie Kondos’s book and throughout all the useless shit.\nFinally, the most important lesson from this book, the most fundamental principle of organization, the one that is most critical to keeping us from forgetting or losing things, is this: Shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world.\nI think that it is an interesting read and that people who want to get better at understanding how they can unclog their minds would like it very much.\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nCognitive psychologists have provided mountains of evidence over the last twenty years that memory is unreliable. And to make matters worse, we show staggering overconfidence in many recollections that are false.\n\n\nA key to understanding the organized mind is to recognize that on its own, it doesn’t organize things the way you might want it to. It comes preconfigured, and although it has enormous flexibility, it is built on a system that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to deal with different kinds and different amounts of information than we have today.\n\n\nThe dominant metaphor for the computer is based on a 1950s Mad Men–era strategy for organization: a desktop with folders on it, and files inside of those. Even the word computer is outdated now that most people don’t use their computer to compute anything at all—\n\n\nit’s been estimated that there are over one million products in the United States today (based on SKUs, or stock-keeping units, those little bar codes on things we buy).\n\n\nNeuroscientists have discovered that unproductivity and loss of drive can result from decision overload. Although most of us have no trouble ranking the importance of decisions if asked to do so, our brains don’t automatically do this.\n\n\nIn 2011, Americans took in five times as much information every day as they did in 1986—the equivalent of 175 newspapers.\n\n\nDuring our leisure time, not counting work, each of us processes 34 gigabytes or 100, words every day. The world’s 21, television stations produce 85, hours of original programming every day as we watch an average of 5 hours of television each day, the equivalent of 20 gigabytes of audio-video images\n\n\nA steady flow of complaints about the proliferation of books reverberated into the late 1600s. Intellectuals warned that people would stop talking to each other, burying themselves in books, polluting their minds with useless, fatuous ideas.\n\n\nFive exabytes ( × 1018) of new data were produced in January 2012 alone—that’s 50, times the number of words in the entire Library of Congress.\n\n\nCollectively, this is known as shadow work—it represents a kind of parallel, shadow economy in which a lot of the service we expect from companies has been transferred to the customer. Each of us is doing the work of others and not getting paid for it. It is responsible for taking away a great deal of the leisure time we thought we would all have in the twenty-first century.\n\n\nOur own term bugs is an informal and heterogeneous category combining ants, beetles, flies, spiders, aphids, caterpillars, grasshoppers, ticks, and a large number of living things that are biologically and taxonomically quite distinct.\n\n\nOne thing HSPs do over and over every day is active sorting, what emergency room nurses call triage. Triage comes from the French word trier, meaning “to sort, sift, or classify.”\n\n\nTo recap, there are four components in the human attentional system: the mind-wandering mode, the central executive mode, the attentional filter, and the attentional switch, which directs neural and metabolic resources among the mind-wandering, stay-on-task, or vigilance modes\n\n\nThe word souvenir, not coincidentally, comes from the French word for “to remember.”\n\n\nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky said that the problem with making decisions is that we are often making them under conditions of uncertainty.\n\n\nWomen’s cortisol levels (the stress hormone) spike when confronted with such clutter (men’s, not so much).\n\n\nOrganization Rule 1: A mislabeled item or location is worse than an unlabeled item.\n\n\nOrganization Rule 2: If there is an existing standard, use it.\n\n\nOrganization Rule 3: Don’t keep what you can’t use.\n\n\n“People can’t do [multitasking] very well, and when they say they can, they’re deluding themselves.” And it turns out the brain is very good at this deluding business.\n\n\n“Nothing is foolproof because fools are ingenious\n\n\nSpeed daters are lousy at assessing who wants to date them and who does not (so much for intuition).\n\n\nSpecifically, the more cognitive load one is experiencing, the more likely one is to make errors in judgment about the causes of an individual’s behavior.\n\n\nRacism is a form of negative social judgment that arises from a combination of belief perseverance, out-group bias, categorization error, and faulty inductive reasoning.\n\n\nIf you’re interested in seeing what it’s like to have prefrontal cortex damage, there’s a simple, reversible way: Get drunk. Alcohol interferes with the ability of prefrontal cortex neurons to communicate with one another, by disrupting dopamine receptors and blocking a particular kind of neuron called an NMDA receptor, mimicking the damage we see in frontal lobe patients.\n\n\nDon’t forget that the awareness of an unread e-mail sitting in your inbox can effectively reduce your IQ by 10 points, and that multitasking causes information you want to learn to be directed to the wrong part of the brain.\n\n\nThis constant back-and-forth is one of the most metabolism-consuming things that our brain can do. We step out of time, out of the moment, and survey the big picture. We like what we see or we don’t, and then we go back to the task, either moving forward again, or backtracking to fix a conceptual or physical mistake.\n\n\nThe real job in supervising PhD students isn’t teaching them facts; it’s keeping them on track.\n\n\nIn particular, we now know that sleep plays a vital role in the consolidation of events of the previous few days, and therefore in the formation and protection of memories.\n\n\nThe first is unitization, the combining of discrete elements or chunks of an experience into a unified concept. For example, musicians and actors who are learning a new piece or scene might practice one phrase at a time; unitization during sleep binds these together into a seamless whole. The second kind of information processing we accomplish during sleep is assimilation. Here, the brain integrates new information into the existing network structure of other things you already knew. In learning new words, for example, your brain works unconsciously to construct sample sentences with them, turning them over and experimenting with how they fit into your preexisting knowledge. Any brain cells that used a lot of energy during the day show an increase of ATP (a neural signaling coenzyme) during sleep, and this has been associated with assimilation. The third process is abstraction, and this is where hidden rules are discovered and then entered into memory. If you learned English as a child, you learned certain rules about word formation such as “add s to the end of a word to make it plural” or “add ed to the end of a word to make it past tense.”\n\n\nMost of the memory consolidation occurs in the first two hours of slow-wave, NREM sleep, and during the last 90 minutes of REM sleep in the morning. This is why drinking and drugs (including sleep medications) can interfere with memory, because that crucial first sleep cycle is compromised by intoxication.\n\n\nWhen professional basketball players got ten hours of sleep a night, their performance improved dramatically: Free-throw and three-point shooting each improved by 9%.\n\n\nContrary to popular myth, the elderly do not need less sleep; they are just less able to sleep for eight hours at a stretch.\n\n\nSleepiness was responsible for 250, traffic accidents in 2009, and is one of the leading causes of friendly fire—soldiers mistakenly shooting people on their own side.\n\n\nSleep deprivation is estimated to cost U.S. businesses more than $ billion a year in absences, accidents, and lost productivity—for comparison, that’s roughly the same as the annual revenue of Apple Corporation.\n\n\nWestward travel finds us having to delay our bedtime, which is not so difficult to do. Eastward travel finds us arriving in a city where it’s bedtime and we’re not yet tired. Traveling east is difficult even for people who do it all the time.\n\n\nOnce you’re on the plane, if you’re westbound, keep the overhead reading lamp on, even if it is your home bedtime. When you arrive in the western city, exercise lightly by taking a walk in the sun. That sunlight will delay the production of melatonin in your body. If you’re on an eastbound plane, wear eye shades to cover your eyes two hours or so before sunset in your destination city, to acclimate yourself to the new “dark” time.\n\n\nProcrastination comes in two types. Some of us procrastinate in order to pursue restful activities—spending time in bed, watching TV—while others of us procrastinate certain difficult or unpleasant tasks in favor of those that are more fun or that yield an immediate reward.\n\n\nThe writer and polymath George Plimpton noted that successful people have paradoxically had many more failures than people whom most of us would consider to be, well, failures. If this sounds like double-talk or mumbo jumbo, the resolution of the paradox is that successful people (or people who eventually become successful) deal with failures and setbacks very differently from everyone else.\n\n\nDuring flow, you experience freedom from worry about failure; you are aware of what needs to be done, but you don’t feel that you are doing it—the ego is not involved and falls away completely.\n\n\nFlow is a chemically different state as well, involving a particular neurochemical soup that has not yet been identified. It appears there needs to be a balance of dopamine and noradrenaline, particularly as they are modulated in a brain region known as the striatum (seat of the attentional switch), serotonin (for freedom to access stream-of-consciousness associations), and adrenaline (to stay focused and energized).\n\n\nFlow is not always good; it can be disruptive when it becomes an addiction, and it is socially disruptive if flow-ers withdraw from others and stay in their own cocoon.\n\n\nThe solution is to follow the five-minute rule. If there is something you can get done in five minutes or less, do it now. If you have twenty things that would only take five minute each, but you can spare only thirty minutes now, prioritize thTem and do the others later or tomorrow, or delegate them.\n\n\nOne thing that many successful people do for time management is to calculate how much their time is subjectively worth to them.\n\n\nAs a time-saver, cognitive psychologist Stephen Kosslyn recommends that if you are not the kind of person who overspends—that is, if you know you can live within your means—stop balancing your checkbook. Banks seldom make errors anymore, he notes, and the average size of the error is likely to be minuscule compared to the hours you’ll spend squaring every purchase.\n\n\nTell a twenty-year-old that he has only five years left to live and he tends to become more like a seventy-five-year-old—not particularly interested in new experiences, instead favoring spending time with family and friends and taking time for familiar pleasures.\n\n\nIndeed, prisoners on death row tend to ask for familiar foods for their last meals: pizza, fried chicken, and burgers, not crêpes suzette or cassoulet de canard.\n\n\nBeing creative means allowing the nonlinear to intrude on the linear, and to exercise some control over the output.\n\n\nNothing comes to my desk that is perfectly solvable,” President Obama observed. “Otherwise, someone else would have solved it.”\n\n\nAt that point, President Obama says, “you wind up dealing with probabilities. Any given decision you make, you’ll wind up with a thirty to forty percent chance that it isn’t going to work.”\n\n\n“In any sufficiently large organization, with an effective management system in place, there is going to be a pyramid shape with decision makers at every level. The only time I am brought in is when the only known solutions have a downside, like someone losing their job, or the company losing large sums of money. And usually the decision is already framed for me as two negatives. I’m the one who has to choose which of those two negatives we can live with.”\n\n\nThis error in reasoning is so pervasive that it has a name—the representativeness heuristic. It means that people or situations that appear to be representative of one thing effectively overpower the brain’s ability to reason, and cause us to ignore the statistical or base rate information.\n\n\n“Doctors generate better knowledge of efficacy than of risk, and this skews decision-making.”\n\n\nTake cardiac bypass surgery—there are 500, performed in the United States every year. What is the evidence that it is helpful? Randomized clinical trials show no survival benefit in most patients who had undergone the surgery. But surgeons were unconvinced because the logic of the procedure to them was justification enough.\n\n\nAngioplasty went from zero to 100, procedures a year with no clinical trials—like bypass surgery, its popularity was based simply on the logic of the procedure, but clinical trials show no survival benefit. Some doctors tell their patients that angioplasty will extend their life expectancy by ten years, but for those with stable coronary disease, it has not been shown to extend life expectancy by even one day.\n\n\nA potent example of the pitfalls in medical decision-making comes from the current state of prostate cancer treatments. An estimated 2. million men in the United States have prostate cancer, and 3% of men will die from it. That doesn’t rank it in the Top Ten causes of death, but it is the second leading cause of cancer death for men, after lung cancer. Nearly every urologist who delivers the news will recommend radical surgery to remove the prostate. And on first blush, it sounds reasonable—we see cancer, we cut it out. Several things make thinking\n\n\nA potent example of the pitfalls in medical decision-making comes from the current state of prostate cancer treatments.

Nearly every urologist who delivers the news will recommend radical surgery to remove the prostate. And on first blush, it sounds reasonable—we see cancer, we cut it out.\n\n\n“Surgeons are taught that ‘a chance to cut is a chance to cure,’” he says. “It’s part of the DNA of their culture. In the examples you’ve been giving me about cancer, with the odds and statistics all carefully analyzed, the science of treatment is in collision with the art of practicing medicine—and it is an art.”\n\n\n“We don’t mention these complications to patients because they might be discouraged from getting the biopsy, which is a very important procedure for them to have.” This is the kind of paternalism that many of us dislike from doctors, and it also violates the core principle of informed consent.\n\n\n“Every parent who has stayed up waiting for a teenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize the feeling. You may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but you cannot help images of disaster from coming to mind.”\n\n\nIn the two months following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, so many people in the United States were afraid to fly that they took to their cars for trips they otherwise would have taken by plane. There were no more airplane crashes in October or November, but 2, more people died in automobile crashes during that period than usually do. These people focused on the numerator (four horrible airplane crashes, 246 people aboard them) but not the denominator (ten million safe commercial flights per year in the United States).\n\n\nDietary supplements now account for 20% of drug-related liver injuries, tripling the rate from ten years ago.\n\n\nOne of Kahneman and Tversky’s many great insights was that both gains and losses are nonlinear, meaning that the same amount of gain (or loss) does not cause equal happiness (or sadness)—\n\n\nNuclear power plants, for example, tend to have very tall vertical structures because supervision is extremely important—even a small error can result in a disaster.\n\n\nAt McGill University, the dean of science undertook an initiative several years ago called STARS (Science Talks About Research for Staff). These were lunchtime talks by professors in the science department who described their research to the general staff: secretaries, bookkeepers, technicians, and the custodial staff. These jobs tend to be very far removed from the actual science. The initiative was successful by any measure—the staff gained an understanding of the larger context of what they were doing. A bookkeeper realized she wasn’t just balancing the books for any old research lab but for one that was on the cusp of curing a major disorder.\n\n\nBut one could argue that William Shakespeare was immensely productive. Before dying at the age of fifty-two, he composed thirty-eight plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. Most of his works were produced in a twenty-four-year period of intense productivity.\n\n\nGreater productivity appears to be the reward. Other factors contribute to productivity, such as being an early riser: Studies have shown that early birds tend to be happier, more conscientious and productive, than night owls\n\n\n“For deadlines, you might need to keep a tickler file. For example, as soon as you learn about any kind of deadline, you need to talk to the boss about it and see how long they think they’ll need. Then you put a tickler on the calendar on the day they’re supposed to start working on it.”\n\n\nYou may want to turn off all your e-mail accounts during a productivity hour except for the one your assistant and your boss use to reach you right away.\n\n\nStudies have found that productivity goes up when the number of hours per week of work goes down, strongly suggesting that adequate leisure and refueling time pays off for employers and for workers.\n\n\nThis may remind you of the problem with online dating sites mentioned in Chapter 4—that more information is not always better and, in that context, has been found to lead to poorer selectivity and poorer choices as online daters become overwhelmed by irrelevant information and suffer both cognitive overload and decision fatigue.\n\n\nHe said that a string is random if there is no way to describe it or represent it in an abbreviated form. By his definition, number 1 above is not random because we can come up with a scheme (computer scientists call this an algorithm) to represent it in brief.\n\n\nKolmogorov complexity theory encapsulates it this way: Something is random when you cannot explain how to derive a sequence using any fewer than the number of elements in the sequence itself.\n\n\nAnd, according to Kolmogorov complexity theory, if the org chart can be described by a small number of simple rules, the company is said to be highly structured.\n\n\nIt seems obvious to us, but in a company with 250, employees, big ideas can get lost.\n\n\nThis reduces the Shannon information content and reduces Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n\nWhy do psychiatrists work a fifty-minute hour? They use that extra ten minutes to write down what happened. Rather than scheduling meetings back-to-back, experts advise giving yourself ten minutes to write down what happened, to make notes about what needs to be done, and other comments that will orient you to this project when you next start to work on it.\n\n\nA study by Microsoft engineers found that 25% of all servers suffer a disk failure within two years. These are reasons to back up your data—many IT experts have an aphorism, “It’s not if your hard drive will fail—it’s when.”\n\n\n“Social media isn’t journalism, it’s information. Journalism is what you do with it.”\n\n\nBecause the industry is unregulated, figures are hard to come by, but The Economist estimates that it is a $ billion business worldwide. Forty percent of Americans report using alternative medicines and therapies;\n\n\nPseudoscience often uses the terminology of science and observation but does not use the full rigor of controlled experiments and falsifiable hypotheses.\n\n\nAs I’ve emphasized throughout this book, the most fundamental principle of organization, the one that is most critical to keeping us from forgetting or losing things, is this: Shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world.\n\n\nIf we can take some or all of the process out of our brains and put it into the physical world, we are less likely to make mistakes. But the organized mind enables you to do much more than merely avoid mistakes. It enables you to do things and go places you might not otherwise imagine. Externalizing information doesn’t always involve writing it down or encoding it in some external medium.\n\n\n“There is a whiff of nostalgia in this sort of warning, along with an undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower can be better.\n\n\nAs with Einstein, the key to the NCI initiative is that nonlinear, creative thinking be tethered to rational, linear thinking in order to implement it in the most robust and rigorous way possible—the dreams of men and women paired with the vast resources of computers.\n\n"},"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Productivity/UltraLearning":{"slug":"Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Productivity/UltraLearning","filePath":"Books/Book Reviews/Work/Productivity/UltraLearning.md","title":"UltraLearning","links":[],"tags":["books","digital-garden","book-review"],"content":"UltraLearning\n🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nIt is a book about learning, based a little bit on the Deep Work and the Atomic Habits style of book.

Yet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.\n\n\nWhile the brain is exquisitely powerful, even the brain of a Harvard graduate can be turned into that of an eight-year-old simply by being made to do two things at once.\n\n\nYet making complex decisions and solving new problems is difficult for any stretch of time because of some real biological limits on your brain. Surprisingly, one of the best ways to improve mental performance is to understand these limits.\n\n\nThese five functions, understanding, deciding, recalling, memorizing, and inhibiting, make up the majority of conscious thought and are recombined to plan, problem-solve, communicate, and other tasks. Each function uses the prefrontal cortex intensively and requires significant resources to operate,\n\n\nConscious mental activities chew up metabolic resources, the fuel in your blood, significantly faster than automatic brain functions such as how your brain helps keep your heart beating or your lungs breathing. The stage requires a lot of energy to function.\n\n\nThe first clinical evidence for this limitation came way back in 1898. The scientist J. C. Welsh measured people’s ability to do physical tasks while thinking. She had subjects start a mental task and then asked them to impose as much force as they could, at the same time, on a dynamometer, a machine for measuring force. Her measurements showed that almost all mental tasks reduced maximum force, often by as much as 50 percent.\n\n\nIf Emily knew how energy-hungry her stage was, she would start her Monday morning differently. The big difference is she would prioritize prioritizing. She would prioritize first, before any other attention-rich activity such as emailing. That’s because prioritizing is one of the brain’s most energy-hungry processes.\n\n\nThis partly explains why people spend more time thinking about problems (things they have seen) than solutions (things they have never seen). It explains why setting goals feels so hard (it’s hard to envision the future). Daniel Gilbert’s 2006 book, Stumbling on Happiness, dives deeply into the implications of this finding, illustrating how human beings are terrible at estimating emotions in the future, a concept he calls affective forecasting.\n\n\nGilbert shows how people define how they will feel in the future based more on the way they feel today, instead of correctly assessing the mental state they might be in at a future date. That’s because it’s difficult.\n\n\nLike the coding used on the ski slopes for the degree of difficulty, there are mental tasks that are green, blue, and black. Prioritizing, at least in a knowledge economy full of conceptual projects, is definitely a black run, perhaps even a double black diamond. Do it when you are fresh and energized, or you might crash and burn down the hill.\n\n\nThis tendency means scheduling the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind. This could be early in the morning, or perhaps after a break or exercise. The prefrontal cortex has much in common with other energy-hungry body parts such as muscles. It tires from use, and can do a lot more after a good rest. Making a tough decision might take thirty seconds when you are fresh and be impossible when you’re not.\n\n\nOne final insight about prioritizing involves getting disciplined about what you don’t put on the stage. This means not thinking when you don’t have to, becoming disciplined about not paying attention to non-urgent tasks unless, or until, it’s truly essential that you do. Learning to say no to mental tasks that are not among your priorities is difficult but very helpful. Another technique for thinking less about unnecessary tasks is to delegate well.\n\n\nAnother technique is not to think at all about a project until all the information is at hand. Don’t waste energy solving a problem you know you will have more information about later.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nConscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.\nEvery time the brain works on an idea consciously, it uses up a measurable and limited resource.\nSome mental processes take up a lot more energy than others.\nThe most important mental processes, such as prioritizing, often take the most effort.*\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nThink of conscious thinking as a precious resource to conserve. Prioritize prioritizing, as it’s an energy-intensive activity.\nSave mental energy for prioritizing by avoiding other high-energy consuming conscious activities such as dealing with emails.\nSchedule the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind.\nUse the brain to interact with information rather than trying to store information, by creating visuals for complex ideas and by listing projects.\nSchedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul has hit a second limit of the prefrontal cortex here: there’s a limit to how much information can be held in mind and manipulated at any one time. That’s because the stage is small, smaller than generally acknowledged. To make a series of important decisions this morning, Paul has to quickly make sense of a huge amount of information.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nThe stage is small, much smaller than commonly realized.\nThe less you hold in mind at once the better.\nNew concepts take up more space on the stage than ideas you know well.\nMemory starts to degrade when you try to hold more than one idea in mind.\nWhen trying to make a decision between items, the optimal number of items to compare is two. The optimal number of different ideas to hold in mind at one time is no more than three or four, ideally three.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nSimplify information by approximating and focusing on an idea’s salient elements.\nGroup information into chunks whenever you have too much information.\nPractice getting your most important actors onstage first, not just the ones that are easiest.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis idea that conscious processes need to be done one at a time has been studied in hundreds of experiments since the 1980s. For example, the scientist Harold Pashler showed that when people do two cognitive tasks at once, their cognitive capacity can drop from that of a Harvard MBA to that of an eight-year-old. It’s a phenomenon called dual-task interference.\n\n\nThe lesson is clear: if accuracy is important, don’t divide your attention.\n\n\nThe problem isn’t doing two things at once so much as doing two conscious mental tasks at once, unless you are okay with a significant drop in performance.\n\n\n“To pay continuous partial attention is to keep a top-level item in focus, and constantly scan the periphery in case something more important emerges.”\n\n\nWhat people tend to do is what Emily tried to do in the meeting. They try to hold several focuses at once and switch rapidly between them. You might think this is a fine idea. But consider what happens when you hold tasks in the background. Given your small working memory, you decrease the amount of data that can be held for what you want to focus on at any moment. Instead of four items on the stage at once, you may be down to three, or even just two. Space is being taken up in working memory for the items held just off the stage.\n\n\nOnce you repeat a pattern often enough, the basal ganglia can drive the process, freeing up the stage for new functions. Develop routines that can be repeated over and over again: How you call people. How you open up a new document, how you delete emails, how you schedule your time.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nYou can focus on only one conscious task at a time.\nSwitching between tasks uses energy; if you do this a lot you can make more mistakes.\nIf you do multiple conscious tasks at once you will experience a big drop-off in accuracy or performance.\nThe only way to do two mental tasks quickly, if accuracy is important, is doing one of them at a time. Multitasking can be done easily if you are executing embedded routines.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nCatch yourself trying to do two things at once and slow down instead.\nEmbed repetitive tasks where you can.\nGet decisions and thinking processes into the right order to reduce “queues” of decisions.\nIf you have to multitask, combine active thinking tasks only with automatic, embedded routines.\n\n\n\nOne study found that office distractions eat up an average 2. hours a day. Another study found that employees spend an average of 11 minutes on a project before being distracted. After an interruption, it takes them 25 minutes to return to the original task, if they do at all. People switch activities every 3 minutes, either making a call, speaking with someone in their cubicle, or working on a document.\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, if you’re looking for a technological solution to being more efficient, getting a bigger computer screen is one of the few clear winners.\n\n\nLess energy equals less capacity to understand, decide, recall, memorize, and inhibit. The result could be mistakes on important tasks. Or distractions can cause you to forget good ideas and lose valuable insights. Having a great idea and not being able to remember it can be frustrating, like an itch you can’t scratch, yet another distraction to manage.\n\n\nOnce you understand how much energy is involved in high-level thinking such as planning and creating, you might be more vigilant about allowing distractions to steal your attention.\n\n\nOne reason for your wandering attention is that the nervous system is constantly processing, reconfiguring, and reconnecting the trillions of connections in your brain each moment. The term for this is ambient neural activity. If you were to look at the electrical activity even in a resting brain, it would look like planet Earth from space with electrical storms lighting up different regions several times a second. The result is a stream of thoughts and images emerging into conscious awareness.\n\n\nOr, as scientist and philosopher Jonathan Haidt at New York University says, we are the descendants of people who paid a lot of attention when there was a rustle in the bushes\n\n\nThis partly explains humanity’s universal resistance to wide-scale change: big changes have too much novelty.\n\n\n“Self-control is a limited resource,” says Baumeister. “After exhibiting self-control, people have a reduced ability to exhibit further self-control.”\n\n\nIt seems that you may not have much free will, but you do have “free won’t” (a term coined by Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz), which is the ability to avoid urges. However, you have only a small window in which to inhibit a response. And, of course, if your stage is too full, you may not have the space to hold the concept of inhibition there. It’s starting to become clear why, when you’re tired, hungry, or anxious, it’s easier to make mistakes and harder to inhibit the wrong impulses.\n\n\nWhen you develop language that describes an activity, at least in this experiment, it’s more likely that you can catch yourself about to do something before taking the action. Having explicit language gives you more veto power. When you have words for a pattern, which means the prefrontal cortex is involved, a lot more is possible in relation to that pattern.\n\n\nIf you have language for the way your mental stage gets tired, you will catch this exhaustion as it happens. If you have language to describe the feeling of having too much on your stage at once, you will be more likely to notice it.\n\n\nThe harder part is learning to inhibit impulses as they arise. To inhibit impulses, you must veto them before they turn from impulse into action. And you are more likely to be able to veto an action if you have explicit language for the mental processes involved. It pays to know a lot about how your brain works, so you can catch your brain while you try to work.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nAttention is easily distracted.\nWhen we get distracted it’s often a result of thinking about ourselves, which activates the default network in the brain.\nA constant storm of electrical activity takes place in the brain.\nDistractions exhaust the prefrontal cortex’s limited resources. Being “always on” (connected to others via technology) can drop your IQ significantly, as much as losing a night’s sleep.\nFocus occurs partly through the inhibition of distractions.\nThe brain has a common braking system for all types of braking.\nInhibition uses a lot of energy because the braking system is part of the prefrontal cortex.\nEach time you inhibit something, your ability to inhibit again is reduced.\nInhibition requires catching an impulse when it first emerges, before the momentum of an action takes over.\nHaving explicit language for mental patterns gives you a greater ability to stop patterns emerging early on, before they take over.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nWhen you need to focus, remove all external distractions completely.\nReduce the likelihood of internal distractions by clearing your mind before embarking on difficult tasks.\nImprove your mental braking system by practicing any type of braking, including physical acts.\nInhibit distractions early before they take on momentum.\n\n\n\nIn 1908, scientists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson discovered a fact about human performance that they called the inverted U. They found that performance was poor at low levels of stress, hit a sweet spot at reasonable levels of stress, and tapered off under high stress. The verb stress means “to emphasize,” and it’s not necessarily a negative thing. It’s wrong to think your performance would improve if stress disappeared from your life. It takes a certain amount of stress just to get out of bed in the morning. This type of stress is known as eustress, or positive stress. Positive stress helps focus your attention.\n\n\nPutting aside stimulants such as caffeine (which is, like a bigger computer screen, a proven technique for increasing mental performance), there are two main strategies for increasing arousal.\n\n\nOne strategy, perhaps the easiest and quickest, is to increase adrenaline levels by bringing “urgency” to a task. Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is the brain equivalent of the adrenaline most people feel before public speaking. It’s the chemistry of fear. When you are scared, you pay intense attention; you are highly alert. Fear brings a deep and immediate alertness. Norepinephrine also turns out to be important for binding circuits together in the prefrontal cortex. You can play various “tricks” on yourself to generate the release of this chemical. Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it. One study found that picturing yourself doing a finger exercise increased muscle mass by 22 percent, which was close to the 30 percent achieved by doing the exercise for real.\n\n\nScientists have also found that expecting a positive event, anything the brain perceives as a reward, generates dopamine. Rewards to the brain include food, sex, money, and positive social interactions. So Paul could have put his prefrontal cortex into the right neurochemical sweet spot by focusing on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way.\n\n\nOne study showed that new lovers’ brains have a lot in common with people on cocaine. Dopamine is sometimes called the “drug of desire.” Too much dopamine, from being “high with excitement,” can also be exhausting.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nPeak mental performance requires just the right level of stress, not minimal stress.\nPeak mental performance occurs when you have intermediate levels of two important neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine, which relate to alertness and interest.\nYou can consciously manipulate your levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in many ways, to improve your alertness or interest.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nPractice being aware of your levels of alertness and interest throughout the day.\nBring your adrenaline level up when needed with a small dose of visualizing a mild fear.\nBring your dopamine level up when needed, using novelty in any form, including changing perspective, humor, or expecting something positive.\nBring your dopamine or adrenaline level down by activating other regions of the brain other than the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n\nEmily has hit what is known in neuroscience circles as an impasse. An impasse is a roadblock to a desired mental path. It’s a connection you want to make but can’t. An impasse can be anything from trying to remember an old friend’s name, to working out what you will name your child, to suffering full-blown writer’s block.\n\n\n“There is a famous old quote from William James on attention: ‘Everyone knows what attention is until you try to define it,’”\n\n\nOhlsson’s research shows that people have to stop themselves from thinking along one path before they can find a new idea. “The projection of prior experience has to be actively suppressed and inhibited,” Ohlsson explains. “This is surprising, as we tend to think that inhibition is a bad thing, that it will lower your creativity.\n\n\nThis is why companies such as Google create work environments that allow for fun and play. They have seen that this increases the quality of ideas.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nIt’s astonishingly easy to get stuck on the same small set of solutions to a problem, called the impasse phenomenon.\nResolving an impasse requires letting the brain idle, reducing activation of the wrong answers.\nHaving insights involves hearing subtle signals and allowing loose connections to be made. This requires a quiet mind, with minimal electrical activity.\nInsights occur more frequently the more relaxed and happy you are.\nThe right hemisphere, which involves the connections between information more than specific data, contributes strongly to insight.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nWhen You Hit a Mental Wall Take the pressure off yourself, get an extension on your deadline, do something fun, reduce your anxiety any way you can.\nTake a break and do something light and interesting, to see if an answer emerges.\nTry quieting your mind and see what is there in the more subtle connections.\nFocus on the connections between information rather than drilling down into a problem; look at patterns and links from a high level rather than getting detailed.\nSimplify problems to their salient features; allow yourself to reflect from a high level, watch for the tickle of subtle connections preceding insight, and stop and focus on insights when they occur.\n\n\n\n“The unexamined life is not worth living.”\n\n\nWhen you listen to a hunch that you need to stop emailing and think about how to plan your day better, you’re being mindful. When you notice that you need to focus so you don’t get lost driving to a meeting, you’re being mindful. In each case you are noticing inner signals. The ability to notice these kinds of signals is a central platform for being more effective at work. Knowledge of your brain is one thing, but you also need to be aware of what your brain is doing at any moment for any knowledge to be useful.\n\n\nMindfulness is clearly useful for getting and staying healthy, but is that just because it makes you less stressed, or is there something more powerful going on here?\n\n\n“Mindfulness is a habit, it’s something the more one does, the more likely one is to be in that mode with less and less effort … it’s a skill that can be learned. It’s accessing something we already have. Mindfulness isn’t difficult. What’s difficult is to remember to be mindful.” I love this last statement. Mindfulness isn’t difficult: the hard part is remembering to do it.\n\n\nYour ability to regulate your emotions instead of being at the mercy of them is central to being effective in a chaotic world.\n\n\n“Everything you do in life is based on your brain’s determination to minimize danger or maximize reward,” Gordon explains. ‘“Minimize danger, maximize reward’ is the organizing principle of the brain.”\n\n\nEmotions such as curiosity, happiness, and contentment are toward responses. Anxiety, sadness, and fear, on the other hand, are away responses.\n\n\nClearly, being able to regulate your emotions well is not a “nice skill to have.” It’s essential for success, not just in work, but in life overall.\n\n\nsituation selection, situation modification, and attention deployment.\n\n\nIf Paul knew he was terrible at pitching to customers, he might have chosen not to pitch anymore and to hire someone else to do that task. That’s situation selection at work. Once you’re in a situation, you can modify it to some degree.\n\n\nEven when you’re already in a situation, you can still decide where to put your attention. That’s attention deployment.\n\n\nThe first option is to express your emotions. If you’re upset, cry, as kids do. Obviously, in many social and work settings, this doesn’t work too well.\n\n\nThe second option is expressive suppression, which requires holding the feeling down and stopping the emotion from being perceived by others. Paul tried to suppress his emotions early in the meeting. He was angry at himself for messing up with a previous client, and he tried not to let this show.\n\n\n“Even after you’ve got yourself into a bad situation, you can still, even at this relatively late stage, think about it differently,” Gross explains. There are two examples of this phenomenon. One is called labeling. It’s when you take a situation and put a label on your emotions. The other is called reappraisal, which involves changing your interpretation of an event. We will explore reappraisal in the next scene and focus here on labeling.\n\n\nTo reduce arousal, you need to use just a few words to describe an emotion, and ideally use symbolic language, which means using indirect metaphors, metrics, and simplifications of your experience. This requires you to activate your prefrontal cortex, which reduces the arousal in the limbic system\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nThe brain has an overarching organizing principle to minimize danger (an away response) and maximize reward (a toward response).\nThe limbic system can be aroused easily.\nThe away response is stronger, faster, and longer lasting than the toward response.\nThe away response can reduce cognitive resources, make it harder to think about your thinking, make you more defensive, and mistakenly class certain situations as threats.\nOnce an emotion kicks in, trying to suppress it either doesn’t work or makes it worse.\nSuppressing an emotion reduces your memory of events significantly.\nSuppressing an emotion makes other people feel uncomfortable.\nPeople incorrectly predict that labeling an emotion will make them feel worse.\nLabeling an emotion can reduce limbic system arousal. Labeling needs to be symbolic, not a long dialogue about an emotion, for it to reduce arousal.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nUse your director to observe your emotional state.\nBe conscious of things that may increase limbic system arousal and work out ways to reduce these, before the arousal kicks in.\nPractice noticing emotions as they arise, to get better at sensing their presence earlier.\nWhen you sense a strong emotion coming on, refocus your attention quickly on another stimulus, before the emotion takes over.\nPractice assigning words to emotional states to reduce arousal once it kicks in.\n\n\n\n“Your brain receives patterns from the outside world, stores them as memories, and makes predictions by combining what it has seen before and what is happening now… . Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neo-cortex, and the foundation of intelligence.”\n\n\nThis predictive capacity, however, involves far more than just your five senses. Dr. Bruce Lipton, author of The Biology of Belief, says that there are around forty environmental cues you can consciously pay attention to at any one time. Subconsciously this number is more than two million.\n\n\nA study of teenagers in Western cultures found that these teenagers have fewer choices than a felon in prison. Food for thought.\n\n\nThis idea of the importance of a perception of choice is easy to test on children, who often rail against a lack of choice. When a child won’t go to bed, you might reduce her resistance by giving her back a choice. For example, she can choose whether she is read a book or told a story. This choice can have a big impact. It’s the “perception” of choice that matters to the brain.\n\n\n“Our emotional responses ultimately flow out of our appraisals of the world, and if we can shift those appraisals, we shift our emotional responses.”\n\n\nThis is one of the reasons why change is so hard: doing things differently can bring about a negative spiral that can feel overwhelming.\n\n\n“All the brain can know it knows from inside itself.”\n\n\nIf you recognize that all interpretations of the world are only that—interpretations your brain has made, and ultimately just yours—then having a choice about which interpretation you might use at any moment makes more sense.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nCertainty is a primary reward or threat for the brain.\nAutonomy, the feeling of control, is another primary reward or threat for the brain.\nStrong emotions generated by certainty and autonomy may need more than labeling to be managed.\nReappraisal is a powerful strategy for managing increased arousal.\nPeople who reappraise more appear to live better lives.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nWatch for uncertainty creating a feeling of threat; practice noticing this.\nWatch for a feeling of reduced autonomy creating a sense of threat; practice noticing this.\nFind ways to create choice and a perception of autonomy wherever you can.\nPractice reappraisal early when you feel a strong emotion coming on.\nYou can reappraise by reinterpreting an event, or reordering your values, or normalizing an experience, or repositioning your perspective.\nReappraising your own experience is a powerful way of managing internal stressors; use this technique when you are anxious about your mental performance by saying, “That’s just my brain.”\n\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nExpectations are the experience of the brain paying attention to a possible reward (or threat).\nExpectations alter the data your brain perceives.\nIt’s common to fit incoming data into expectations and to ignore data that don’t fit.\nExpectations can change brain functioning; the right dose of expectations can be similar to a clinical dose of morphine.\nExpectations activate the dopamine circuitry, central for thinking and learning.\nMet expectations generate a slight increase in dopamine, and a slight reward response.\nExceeded expectations generate a strong increase in dopamine, and a strong reward response.\nUnmet expectations generate a large drop in dopamine level, and a strong threat response.\nThe dynamic between expectations altering experience and impacting dopamine levels, helps generate an upward or downward spiral in the brain.\nA general feeling of expecting good things generates a healthy level of dopamine, and may be the neurochemical marker of feeling happy.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nPractice noticing what your expectations are in any given situation.\nPractice setting expectations a little lower. To stay in a positive state of mind, find ways to keep coming out ahead of your expectations over and again, even in small ways.\nWhen a positive expectation is not being met, practice reappraising the situation by remembering it’s your brain doing something odd with dopamine.\n\n\n\nSuccess in most jobs today requires a strong ability to collaborate with others. For some people who build their mental maps around logical systems such as computers or engineering, the chaos and uncertainty of dealing with people can be overwhelming.\n\n\n“The more we can see each other, the better we can match emotional states,”\n\n\n“If you want to collaborate well with others you have to understand what kind of state others are in.”\n\n\nOxytocin is released when two people dance together, play music together, or engage in a collaborative conversation. It’s the neurochemistry of safe connectivity.\n\n\nThis phenomenon makes sense: it explains why facilitators and trainers insist on “icebreakers” at the start of workshops, and why “establish rapport” is the first step in any counseling, customer service, or sales training manual. New research does complicate the story of oxytocin as the “trust drug” though.\n\n\nResearch within the positive psychology field shows there is only one experience in life that increases happiness over a long time. It’s not money, above a base survival amount. It’s not health, nor is it marriage or having children. The one thing that makes people happy is the quality and quantity of their social connections.\n\n\n“Loneliness generates a threat response,” Cacioppo explains, “the same as pain, thirst, hunger, or fear.”\n\n\nWhile shared experiences make a difference, shared goals are really the driving force of relatedness. When you’re trying to collaborate with anyone, start with a shared goal, and everything after will be easier.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nSocial connections are a primary need, as important as food and water at times. We know one another directly through experiencing other people’s states ourselves.\nSafe connections with others are vital for health, and for healthy collaboration.\nPeople are classed as friend or foe quickly, with foe as the default in the absence of positive cues.\nYou need to work hard at creating connections to create good collaboration.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nAnytime you meet someone new, make an effort to connect on a human level as early as possible to reduce the threat response.\nCreate an in-group with the people you work with by sharing personal experiences, or create an opportunity for any kind of shared experience.\nCreate shared goals with people you feel you might be in conflict with. Ideally, these goals should be tactical short- to medium-term focuses.\nActively encourage people around you to connect on a human level to create better collaboration.\n\n\n\nPaul doesn’t know that fairness is a primary need for the brain. A sense of fairness in and of itself can create a strong reward response, and a sense of unfairness can generate a threat response that lasts for days.\n\n\nIt’s the principle that counts. Think of people who spend enormous sums of money to “right wrongs” in court, with no obvious economic win other than “justice” or “revenge.” We crave fairness, and some people spend their life savings and even their lives to get\n\n\nIt’s the principle that counts.

Prefrontal cortex functioning tends to shrink briefly as teens hit puberty, which explains why a ten-year-old may have better emotional control than a fifteen-year-old.\n\n\nIn the big downsizings of 2009, one firm’s executives agreed to a pay cut of 15 percent, making a big deal that this was three times more than the 5 percent cut all staff were being asked to undergo, to help reduce layoffs. While a 15 percent cut meant thousands of dollars a year less pay for an executive, this didn’t affect their bonuses, many in the tens of millions of dollars. You can imagine how employees felt about that.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nA sense of fairness can be a primary reward.\nA sense of unfairness can be a primary threat.\nLinking fairness and expectations helps explain the delight of the kindness of strangers, as well as the intense emotions of betrayal from people close to you.\nWhen you accept an unfair situation, you do so by labeling or reappraising.\nMen don’t experience empathy with someone who is in pain who has been unfair, whereas women do.\nPunishing unfair people can be rewarding, and not punishing unfairness can generate a sense of unfairness in itself.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nBe open and transparent about your dealings with people, remembering that unfairness is easy to trigger.\nFind ways to sense increasing fairness around you, perhaps by volunteering or donating money or resources regularly.\nDon’t let unfairness go unpunished.\nWatch out for fairness being linked to other issues such as certainty, autonomy, or relatedness, where you can get intense emotional responses.\n\n\n\nStatus explains why people love to win arguments, even pointless ones.\n\n\nMarketing departments use two main levers to engage human emotions through advertising: fear, and the promise of increased status.\n\n\nBeing left out, being classed as “less than” others, is a universally painful experience.\n\n\nMany of the arguments and conflicts at work, and in life, have status issues at their core. The more you can label status threats as they occur, in real time, the easier it will be to reappraise on the spot and respond more appropriately.\n\n\nStudies of primate communities show that higher-status monkeys have reduced day-to-day cortisol levels, are healthier, and live longer. This isn’t just monkey business (sorry for the pun).\n\n\nThere is an entire book, called The Status Syndrome, by Michael Marmot, which illustrates that status is a significant determinant of human longevity, even controlling for education and income. High status doesn’t just feel good. It brings along bigger rewards, too.\n\n\nStatus is rewarding not just when you have achieved high status, but also anytime you feel as if your status has increased, even in a small way.\n\n\nEven an increase in hope that your status might go up one day seems to pack a reward.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nStatus is a significant driver of behavior at work and across life experiences.\nA sense of status going up, even in a small way, activates your reward circuits.\nA sense of status going down activates your threat circuitry.\nJust speaking to your boss or a person of higher status generally activates a status threat.\nPeople pay a lot of attention to protecting and building their status, probably more to this than any other element of the SCARF model, at least in organizations.\nThere is no one fixed status scale; there are virtually infinite ways of feeling better than others.\nWhen everyone is trying to be higher status than others there is a decrease in relatedness.\nBecause we perceive ourselves using the same circuits we use when perceiving others, you can trick your brain into a status reward by playing against yourself.\nPlaying against yourself increases your status without threatening others.\nStatus is one of five major social domains that are all either primary rewards or threats, which form the SCARF model for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nWatch out for people’s status being threatened.\nReduce status threats in others by lowering your status through sharing your own humanity or mistakes.\nReduce status threats in others by giving people positive feedback.\nFind ways to play against yourself, and pay a lot of attention to any incremental improvements.\nThe slightest feeling of improvement can generate a pleasant and helpful reward.\nPlaying against yourself to improve your understanding of your own brain can be a powerful way of increasing your performance.\n\n\n\nGiving others feedback is often the first strategy people use to facilitate change. Yet, surprisingly, giving feedback is rarely the right way to create real change. While there are many “techniques” to improve the performance of feedback, people miss the basic reality of this approach: feedback creates a strong threat for people in most situations.\n\n\nPaul’s first attempt to help Eric involved a “polite” approach to giving feedback: he said something nice, then attacked Eric’s status, and then said something nice again. To me this is like an “arsenic sandwich”: the bread might make the meal appear more palatable, but it’s still going to kill you.\n\n\n“Performance review.” Mike Morrison, at the time the dean of Toyota University in Los Angeles, commented that annual performance reviews, “Essentially just reduce performance for six days each year: three days while people prepare for it, and three days recovering from it.”\n\n\nOhlsson finds that when someone hits an impasse, telling her what not to think tends to help only 5 percent of the time. Giving people clues about what they should think about tends to help only 8 percent of the time.\n\n\nAs people are often already anxious when stuck at an impasse, and anxiety generally makes people’s views narrow and their brains noisier, it’s important to reduce people’s anxiety and increase their positive emotions—in other words, to shift them from an away state to a toward state. A great way to do this is using elements of the SCARF model. You could help the person increase her sense of status, perhaps by encouraging her. Or increase someone’s sense of certainty by making implicit issues more explicit, say, by clarifying your objectives. Or increase a person’s sense of autonomy by ensuring that he is making the decisions and coming up with the ideas, not just listening to your suggestions.\n\n\nWhat you are doing is facilitating in others the ARIA model (Awareness, Reflection, Insight, and Action), which I introduced back in scene 6, as a fast way of getting past impasses.\n\n\nWhen you review your own work, there’s an incentive to convince yourself that the work is good. You don’t want to look bad to another person. Eric, for example, is convinced he’s done nothing wrong with the school project, especially when Paul thinks he might have.\n\n\nAsking someone else for permission to stretch their thinking can create a nice positive flush from a sense of increased status and autonomy.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nGiving feedback often creates an intense threat response that doesn’t help people improve performance.\nThe problem-solving approach may not be the most effective pathway to solutions.\nProviding suggestions often results in a lot of wasted time. Bringing people to their own insights is a fast way of getting people back on track.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nCatch yourself when you go to give feedback, problem solve, or provide solutions.\nHelp people think about their own thinking by focusing them on their own subtle internal thoughts, without getting into too much detail.\nFind ways to make it valuable for people to give themselves feedback; reward them for activating their director.\n\n\n\nHebb’s Law, which says that “Cells that fire together, wire together.”\n\n\nAs Sir Winston Churchill once said, “I love to learn, but I hate to be taught.”\n\n\n“There are toward goals and away goals,” Barrell explains, “and which one you use has quite an impact on performance.\n\n\nToward goals have you visualize and create connections around where you are going. You are creating new connections. What’s interesting is you start to feel good at lower levels with toward goals. There are benefits earlier. Away goals have you visualize what can go wrong, which reactivates the emotions involved.” The trouble is, because problems come to mind so much easier than solutions, people are always setting away goals instead of toward goals. Also, problems are more certain than unknown solutions, and the brain naturally steers toward certainty. For these reasons and more, toward goals are rare, and setting them might require getting some help from someone else, such as a mentor or coach.\n\n\nWhen you set an away goal, you can end up paying attention to the negative emotions instead of making new connections. Lose weight, stop smoking, don’t drink: most of the New Year’s resolutions of the world are away goals.\n\n\nThe term “attention density,” coined by Jeffrey M. Schwartz, provides a scientific framework for future research about repeated attention. This density can be measured with such variables as frequency, duration, and intensity of attention. This looks like measuring how often you recall an idea, how long each time, and with how much focus.\n\n\nSurprises About the Brain\n\nWhile human change appears hard, change in the brain is constant.\nFocused attention changes the brain.\nAttention goes all too easily to the threat. Once you focus attention away from threat, you can create new connections with the right questions.\nCreating long-term change requires paying regular attention to deepen new circuits, especially when they are new.\n\n\n\nSome Things to Try\n\nPractice watching for people’s emotional state when you want to facilitate change.\nDon’t try to influence people when they are in a strong away state.\nUse elements of the SCARF model to shift people into a toward state.\nPractice using solution-focused questions that focus people’s attention directly on the specific circuits you want to bring to life.\nInvent ways to have people pay repeated attention to new circuits.\n\n\n\nReappraisal.

The customer wants to not have this issue.\nAlso,  no one gives a shit about you. (In a sales context only hopefully.)\nWhat we sell is important, but also, we also need to understand that usually, what we sell will help; that is not in question. The question is, it the thing you sell worth the effort?\nThe thing that sells is the sales experience; it is the combination of the relationship, the problem and the solution to the problem (What you are selling)\n✍️ My Top  Quotes\n\n\nWe create the reasons the customer goes dark. We create the focus on price. We allow the customer to hold us hostage over an irrelevant feature.\n\n\nYou aren’t losing sales because you can’t sell. You’re losing them because you don’t understand how to diagnose your customer problem(s) and how the problem(s) drive the sale. Your product doesn’t drive the sale.\n\n\nThat’s what gap selling is all about. It’s not about pitching products and services; it’s about solving problems and making people’s lives easier.\n\n\n*The nine truths of selling play out in every sales transaction you’ll ever engage in. They are:\n\nNo problem, no sale\nIn every sale there’s a gap\nAll sales are about change\nCustomers don’t like change\nSales are emotional\nCustomers do like change when they feel it’s worth the cost Asking “Why?” gets customers to “Yes”\nSales happen when the future state is a better state\nNo one gives a shit about you*\n\n\n\nEvery sale starts with a problem. If a problem doesn’t exist, there is no sale—period.\n\n\nEvery sales transaction is about identifying a gap—the distance between where customers are now (their current state) and where they want to be (their future state).\n\n\nAssumptions, exposing (and sometimes confirming) the true size of their problem, then correctly assessing the impact it will have on their lives. The more impact, the larger the gap. And the larger the gap, the more valuable the solution, i.e., your product or service.\n\n\nIt supports the idea that humans suffer from longevity bias, the phenomenon in which we ascribe more positive feelings toward things that have been around for a while than toward things that are new.\n\n\nRosabeth Moss Kanter, bestselling author and professor at Harvard Business School, says there are ten threats that cause people to resist change. Inadvertently triggering any one of them during the sales process could easily cause your buyers to pause and reconsider whether they really want to buy. Below are Kanter’s ten threats:\n\n1. Loss of control\n2. Excess uncertainty\n3. Surprises\n4. Too much change at once\n5. Loss of face\n6. Insecurity\n*7. Extra work\n8. The ripple effect\n9. Past resentments\n10. Real danger\n\n\n\nEvery time you ask “Why?” you chip away at the surface layers of your customer’s psyche to get to their intrinsic motivations, the whole reason why they ever gave you a chance to talk to them in the first place.\n\n\nEverything we do, whether we’re six months old or sixty years old, is influenced by an invisible backdrop of events, feelings, and biases that affect the way we perceive the world and react to each other. They all play into the creation of our current state. Your customers have a current state, too, that includes everything we’ve talked about so far—their feelings about change, their intrinsic motivations, the realities of their business, and the facts of their work lives.\n\n\nThe more you learn about your buyer’s current state, the greater you understand the changes necessary, and the more information you will have to close the deal.\n\n\nGap selling requires you to know and understand more about your customer’s world than what you’re probably accustomed to. There is far more to it than what they reveal on their websites. Your goal must be to understand everything you can about what’s happening in their organization as it relates to what you sell.\n\n\nPeople don’t buy products—they buy solutions to their problems. If they can’t recognize at least one clearly defined, measurable problem, your buyer will not buy.\n\n\nWhile you’re at it, you also want to understand how your customers will feel once their problems have been addressed. Why? Because getting people to imagine their emotions in the future, as well as bringing their dreams and desired outcomes into focus, will anchor them in that future.\n\n\nEstablishing your customers’ current state (pain) while anchoring them in the future state (pleasure) primes them to be open to, and even enthusiastic about, allowing you to help them plan for the journey that will take them across the chasm.\n\n\nEarly in my career, I had a sales manager who told me there were two types of salespeople: the ones who were great at socializing and building relationships, and the ones who developed credibility. They were both great at their jobs, but the former would always have\n\n\nEarly in my career, I had a sales manager who told me there were two types of salespeople: the ones who were great at socializing and building relationships, and the ones who developed credibility. They were both great at their jobs, but the former would always have a smaller piece of the business than the latter.\n\n\nPeople want to go to hockey games with their friends; they want to buy from people who know their shit.\n\n\nKnowledgeable about their customers’ industry and organization, and as a result are so well respected, they can pretty much speak their minds at any time, and even push their customers to consider ideas that may make them uncomfortable.\n\n\nThink it’s become pretty clear by now what the gap is. Quite simply, it is the space between the current state and the future state. The gap is where the value of the sale lives. The less drastic the distance between where you are and where you could go, the smaller the gap—the less value there is in changing, and therefore, the less urgent it is for the customer to buy what you’re selling.\n\n\nSalespeople can manipulate the size of the gap by helping the buyer see things they didn’t see before. There is no way customers can understand the value of your life-saving pill if they don’t realize they are dying. That’s why you have to spend so much time exploring their current state and helping them envision their future state.\n\n\nIf you identify a small gap, you may realize that there really isn’t that much you can do to help, or that in the end your customer doesn’t actually need you. That’s OK. In fact, it’s super valuable. Knowing you’re dealing with a small gap keeps you from wasting your time chasing after\n\n\nYour number one job when selling is to get the customer, buyer, or prospect to let you help them.\n\n\nDuring the discovery calls that led to closed deals, salespeople spent more than half of their time listening while their customers talked. The opposite was true of discovery calls that led to missed deals. In those calls, buyers talked only 28% during the length of the call; the salespeople talked almost 80% of the time!\n\n\nThese formulations will help you avoid making your customers feel like you’re badgering them, and instead give them a sense of control. Deb Calvert’s book Discover Questions Get You Connected is a great resource.\n\n\nBeyond probing questions, you want to ask process questions which try to get information on how your customers do what they do.\n\n\nAnswers that leave you guessing. “We’re not growing fast enough,” is simply not sufficient information for you to work with when you’re gap selling. It’s too open to interpretation. What is “fast enough?” Your idea of “fast enough” and your prospects’ may be totally different. Train yourself so that every time you hear a lazy, vague, open-ended answer like, “We need to hire more people,” or “I want to increase revenue,” you stop the conversation and ask the prospect to articulate exactly what they mean. You’ll probably need to help them along, maybe like this:\n\n\nThe thing is, most salespeople focus on solving the technical problems when it’s the business problems that create a customer’s unique buying motivations and lead to the biggest gaps.\n\n\nAt asking questions. Learn to create a rhythm and flow in your questioning that takes your buyer on a journey. Ask the right type of question at the right time in the right tone, and you will be amazed at what you can discover about your customer. Once you get good at it, your destiny will be filled with informational\n\n\nIf you want to get better at selling, you gotta get better at asking questions. Learn to create a rhythm and flow in your questioning that takes your buyer on a journey. Ask the right type of question at the right time in the right tone, and you will be amazed at what you can discover about your customer. Once you get good at it, your destiny will be filled with informational gold.\n\n\nUse your CRM—it’s going to be your best friend. No matter how good you think your memory is, if you’re doing a proper gap-selling discovery, you’ll never be able to recall all the data you collect. Document it in your CRM.\n\n\nIt’s fascinating how we salespeople have been trained to hurry up and get to the close. Don’t be. Have patience. Go slower. Focus on gathering as much information as you can about the world your buyer is struggling with and why they want to change. Remember, change is what this whole game is about.\n\n\nGood salespeople are patient—they don’t just have the patience for the work; they embrace it. They understand that the success or failure of the sale is deeply rooted in getting as much information as possible so they can clearly identify the gap. Great selling takes a maniacal commitment to doing the work and doing it well.\n\n\nGiven the in-depth nature of a gap-selling discovery, you may have already figured out that you should never, ever combine a discovery and a demo. For those of you who didn’t, I’ll say it again: You should never, ever combine a discovery and a demo.\n\n\nDemo Challenge: Try to conduct your entire 45-60  minute presentation without saying the word “if.”  If you succeed, you’ll have conducted a good demo.\n\n\nThe best messages are those that compel recipients to action. What’s the point of writing a message if no one is going to read it, or worse, if they read it and then don’t take the action you’d like?\n\n\nMy research has revealed that 72% of salespeople who used social media to sell outperformed their peers and exceeded quota 23% more often than those who didn’t. That doesn’t mean, however, that you should dump the other channels.\n\n\n*A potential employee’s experience and accomplishments matter, of course, but only—only—in relation to how many of the nine gap-selling traits they embody:\n\ncuriosity\ncritical thinking\nempathy\nproblem-solving\nleadership\ncreativity\ndeliberate learning\ncoachability\nbusiness acumen\n\n\n\nUltimately, to become a superstar gap sales leader you have to make sure that your focus is turned in the right direction. That is, outward. Just as gap selling isn’t about the salesperson but about the customer, being a sales leader isn’t about getting what you need out of your sales team but about providing what your sales team needs to get out of you.\n\n\nIn a study released in their book The Challenger Sale, Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson of CEB (now Gartner) revealed that 53% of customer loyalty was not a product of customer service, as might be expected, but of the sales experience.xv You hear that? More than half of a customer’s loyalty is due to the work your team is doing before the prospect even buys your service or product! They’re not hooked by the company or brand, nor the product and service delivery, nor the value-to-price ratio. They’re hooked by the sales experience. And there is nothing more effective for maximizing that sales experience than gap selling.\n\n"},"Books/Booklist-2023":{"slug":"Books/Booklist-2023","filePath":"Books/Booklist

It is one of my favorite ways to learn and understand things, and I want to be able to read every day.\nI usually try to read before I go to sleep; the ritual makes me sleepy and prepares me to sleep.\nNon-Fiction\nI mostly read nonfiction, as I usually do not find it that difficult to get into nonfiction books. I think this is because a lot of the context in nonfiction is set; you know the world, you know what the premisses are, and therefore, you do not have to use a lot of mental capacity.\n\nReading quite technical manual such as O´reilly books has been a pleasant surprise. I made more progress and find them more interesting than I anticipated.\nWhat is best, to try to read up on theory and then execute or start early with practice and experimentation? I do not know, but I have an inkling. I think a good strategy is getting you feet wet, then read up when you understand the basics, and then go practice with the theory in mind to become more proficient.\n\nFiction\nFiction is something that is important to read, and great works may stay with you for a long time. There is no shame in reading fantasy or science fiction.\nI am a sucker for reading science fiction; it is a guilty pleasure, and to be honest, it does not require that much brain power.\nLinks\n\nPeople who don´t read books\nReading before bed advantages\n5 Book recommendations \nHacker news on best books of 2022\nRyan Holliday Reading list\nHacker News Most Mentioned Books\nChoosing what to read\nHacker News Bookmap\nReading list website\n\nThoughts\n\nBooks demand your attention in a very different way than other things. If you stop reading, then you stop, period. This means that phones, TVs, and other distractions are basically just that, distractions. When I started to read again seriously, I constantly reached for my phone to check it. It was strange to really see how little attention span I had.\nReading disciplines you to take time and concentrate on just one thing. This is important in a distracted society.\nYou can overcome the urge to do things on your mobile phone and read instead; it just takes awareness of the issue, patience, and consistency.\n"},"Books/Literature/Literature":{"slug":"Books/Literature/Literature","filePath":"Books/Literature/Literature.md","title":"Literature","links":["Book-Reviews/Fiction/Classics/The-Brothers-Karamazov"],"tags":["article","literature","books","norwegian-books","classics"],"content":"Literature\nThis section is about the fine arts of literature and how I relate to them. I will use this section mostly as a way for me to relate to the great works.\nIt is said that a classic that it is a work of art that everybody talks about but no one reads.\nGreat works.\nPrimarily, I think of Hamsun as one of the greatest. His literature is emotional, strong on its own, and great because the writing is great. His works resonate even today.  Of the books I have read, I found Victoria and Grown of the Soil particularly good.\nI found Russian literature to be tiresome and challenging to complete.  Half of the book is people making up new nicknames for each other, and the other half is obscure references to Pushkin.\nThe difference between Dostoyevsky and Hamsun is that Dostoyevsky has a moral he wants to display and Hamsun wants to have great writing by just that, great writing.\nLinks\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov\n\nThoughts\n\nUlysses by James Joyce is often referenced as a PhD killer because it blows the mind of every PhD who attempts it, and all they can talk about is the book.\n"},"Books/Literature/Poems":{"slug":"Books/Literature/Poems","filePath":"Books/Literature/Poems.md","title":"Poems","links":[],"tags":["poetics","literature","article","poems","socialism"],"content":"Poems\nGood poems are powerful in a way books cannot be. It is the young man’s game, and its simplicity is in itself artful.\nPoems are similar to mathematics, as the young and curious provide the brightest works. Like mathematics, the name of the game is elegance.\nFavorite Poems\nA Worker Reads History - Who built the monuments? Was it the kings who hauled the stones?  I like this poem because it shows that there are so much to the history than the grand leaders, and that we all have some descendants that lived their lives, did their jobs and at the mercy of nature and fate just like most of all are.\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade - One of Lord Alfred Tennyson´s most famous poems, about a failed cavalry charge against canons. Note: Cavalry charges against fortified canons are rarely a good idea.\nOzymandias Related is the Breaking Bad episode with the same title, which describes Walter White’s fall.\nInvictus -  I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul. This poem was written by William Ernest Henly, who wrote it from a sick bed. This poem inspired Nelson Mandela when he was in prison for over 9000 days.\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\nJust some good poems that is nice to go back to from time to time.\n"},"Cloud/AWS":{"slug":"Cloud/AWS","filePath":"Cloud/AWS.md","title":"AWS","links":[],"tags":["cloud","aws","terraform","amazon","bezos"],"content":"AWS\nAmazon Web Services is the first major player to actually become a cloud provider.

It is like AWS, but only more microsofty. I have worked extensievley with Azure and find it to be a bit cumbersome, with rough edges. Understanding the CLI was key for my development, made things so much easier.  I think this experience is something that is shared across cloud providers.\nStorage\nCognitive Search\nCognitive search is like Google search on the data you have available in a storage container or database.\nReasonably easy tutorial on cognitive search\nCognitive search is based on indexing the documents in the database, a good overview of the search index is available from the Azure documentation\nUsing the command line interface (CLI) is always a good way of understanding and learning the services.  The documentation for cognitive search CLI is pretty good. In my experience doing continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) makes knowing the CLI mandatory.\nMake better indexers with Powerskills Repo\n\nSemantic Search\nAzure Cognitive Search’s Semantic Search is a feature that enhances traditional search methods by understanding the intent and contextual meaning of search queries. By leveraging AI and natural language processing, it can deliver more relevant search results, even when queries are phrased in a conversational manner or have ambiguous terms. It can also provide advanced query capabilities, like document summarisation, named entity recognition, and personalized ranking of search results.\nDemo using Cognitive Search and ChatGPT\nMachine Learning Studio\nDocument intelligence.\nDocument intelligence is usually scanning documents such as pdf for their content using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).  It can retrieve a lot of information and has a very handy feature to extract tables and key value pair. I used it to create quite powerful features with LLMs. For example handling enterprise emails and requests it is quite powerful.\nML-Ops\nML-Ops in Azure Examples\nInfrastructure as Code\nBicep\n\nGitHub Actions for testing Bicep\n\nLinks\n\nA binary large object (BLOB or blob) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity.\n\n\nThoughts\n\nSKU is the product tier of the resource in Azure. In Azure, the term “SKU,” which stands for “Stock Keeping Unit,” refers to a specific version or configuration of an Azure service or product.\nPurge protection in the key vault is that you don’t delete everything by accident.

It is therefore become a major part of releasing software to actually understand cloud and being a good cloud user.\nInfrastructure as Code\nThere are a lot of good resources to learn infra as code, and there are, w unfortunatly a lot of different ways to use infra as code (IaC). However, I think that Terraform is a good tool that works for most of the different types of cloud providers.\nAzure\nLeverages the Microsoft ecosystem to get customers. Aka, you already use Microsoft so why not just use cloud from Microsoft.\nGCP\nThe little brother of the cloud providers. One big advantage is that you can leverage a lot of the google functionality as well.\nAWS\nThe largest, and also the best of the bunch, in my opinion. But with some of the issues related to Amazon that probably never be resolved.\nVirtual Networks\nA Virtual Network, often abbreviated as VNet, is a logically isolated network within a cloud computing environment or your own on-premises data center. It enables you to control your own private space within the cloud, essentially acting as a slice of the cloud’s overall network that you control.\nThings to know:\nDNS: DNS stands for Domain Name System. It’s essentially the “phone book” of the internet, translating human-friendly domain names like www.google.com into IP addresses like 172.217.22.14 that computers use to identify each other on the network.\nCache: a cache is a high-speed, temporary storage layer that stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature so that future requests for that data are served up faster than by accessing the data’s primary storage location.\nLinks\n\nOn Cloud Computing Addiction (video) Cloud is a helluva drug.\n\nThoughts\n\n\n"},"Cloud/GCP":{"slug":"Cloud/GCP","filePath":"Cloud/GCP.md","title":"GCP","links":[],"tags":["gcp","flutter","article","data","database","firebase","cloud","cli"],"content":"GCP\nI have mostly worked with GCP on my own.

An issue with pen-testing is that attackers have technically unlimited time, therefore white box access can be a supplement to an internal pentester that might not have the resources of an attacker.\n\nThe ideal scenario for an attacker is to gain access, that might be either an account or some sort of way of executing code on your application.

When dimension data changes over time, those changes need to be handled gracefully to preserve historical accuracy in analyses and reports. There are several strategies, but here are the three most common types:\nType 1 - Overwrite: In this method, when a change occurs in the dimension data, the existing records are updated with the new data. This effectively erases the historical state. Type 1 is used when it’s unnecessary to keep historical data.\nType 2 - Create a New Record: This approach adds a new record in the dimension table with the new information, keeping the old data intact. Each record usually has a start and an end date to indicate the period of validity, along with a current indicator. I like this one.\nType 3 - Add a Column: Here, instead of creating a new record, a new column is added to the existing record to capture the change. This is used when the nature of changes is predictable, and the history is limited to tracking the current and previous states.\nMicrosoft Fabric\nMicrosoft Fabric is like an MS copy of data warehouses such as Snowflake and Databricks; it is more of a comprehensive platform with more to offer.\nSnowflake\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n“I have never seen a data lake that wasnt a data swamp” - Andriy Burkov\n"},"Data-Engineering/Data-Warehouse/Fabric/Fabric":{"slug":"Data-Engineering/Data-Warehouse/Fabric/Fabric","filePath":"Data Engineering/Data Warehouse/Fabric/Fabric.md","title":"Fabric","links":[],"tags":["article","digital-garden","data","database/sql","data/warehouse/fabric","data/warehouse/lakehouse","data/warehouse/lake","data/warehouse","microsoft","microsoft/fabric","microsoft/power-bi","azure"],"content":"Fabric\nIn the fabric section, I write as much as I am able about the Microsoft data warehouse ecosystem and use Microsoft Fabric as an overarching theme for all things considered.

Mapping how things are done and what the function and relationship of the data are are things that should be included in the model. It is also important for the developers to gain insights and access to the domain knowledge and doing it in the database modeling phase could be quite advantageous.\nChecklist for database modeling.\n1. What is the purpose of this system?\nIn this question, we are trying to ascertain what the overall goal of the data is. It is more or less the function of the data and therefore we want to understand all possible use cases so that we can cater to them during the modeling phase.\n2. Does this database solve all problems?**\nFor all the use cases, can we solve them efficiently using the data we have available today?\n3.

Therefore, it is essential to keep it as simple as possible in order to reduce information friction.\n\nLinks\n\nBenchmarking Databases by Providers is difficult.

I define a big decision as a decision that will affect you every day of your life for no shorter than 3 months or for a large duration of time every year (Every weekend for the rest of the year for example). This means that things such as accepting a job offer and moving in with your spouse to a new place are categorized as big decisions.\nWill this framework help me make better decisions? Not necessarily.  But the reason is to make sure that if you make a wrong decision you understand your own thought process when you actually decide upon the route you took. This will hopefully make sure that you eliminate regret.\nThe whole point of decisions is that you have incomplete information. Therefore, it is important when reviewing the decision to make sure you have a snapshot of the information you had available.\nMake big decisions as type 2 decisions\nFrom Kahneman and Tversky, we have two types of decision-making states, type 1 and type 2\nType 1: Fast, Automatic, and Intuitive\n\nQuick Judgement: These decisions are made almost instantly, relying on intuition or gut feeling.\nLow Effort: Type 1 decisions usually require minimal cognitive processing, and are often subconscious.\nError-Prone: Due to their quick nature, these decisions can sometimes be incorrect or suboptimal.\nExample: Deciding to swerve to avoid a collision while driving.\n\nType 2: Slow, Deliberative, and Analytical\n\nThoughtful Analysis: Type 2 decisions are made after careful evaluation of available options.\nHigh Effort: These decisions usually require active cognitive processing, often using tools like logic and reasoned argument.\nError-Resistant: Slower, more deliberate thinking increases the likelihood of making a correct or optimal choice.\nExample: Choosing a mortgage plan or making a career change.\n\nI think the best way is to extend the decision-making time to at least a couple of days. Make sure you are in a good place, be content and relaxed, not tired, etc. Write down the decision you need to make and why. Investigate the background information and why you need to make\nLinks\n\nOverchoice and How to Avoid it - Note: Buridan´s ass: a mythical donkey that finds itself precisely equidistant from two identical bales of hay. The ass tries to make a firm decision as to whether to eat from the left bale or the right, but since there’s no rational reason to prefer either, the donkey wavers until it starves to death.\nTalk by Snowden on a lot of things but also about decision making.\n\nYou look at 5 % of the data max.\nYou turn up the latest memories of similar events, discussions talks etc.\nYou make a decision\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\nPractice making decisions the right way the same way you practice other things. Do it a lot and then use the experience you get from doing the proper decision process in less essential decisions to reap the benefit in more significant decisions. It can be a decision to go on a hiking trip on Saturday, for example, but it will give you good practice.\nAnalysis paralysis is real, so keep the decisions brief and try only to consider the most critical aspects. If you have ten factors in your decision-making process, then you have at least seven too many.\nThink of decisions as either a one-way or two-way door.  If you can revert the decisions quickly and cheaply (a two-way door), the decision-making is making a quick but informed decision. If the cost of reverting is high, then you should think carefully and do a lot of study and consultation on it. This is from Jeff Bezos\nIt might be contradictory to make decisions longer than a day if you had a day to think about it, it should be enough.\n"},"Design/Design":{"slug":"Design/Design","filePath":"Design/Design.md","title":"Design","links":[],"tags":["article","design","design-sprint","ux","ui","development"],"content":"Design\nAtomic Design\nAtomic design is a methodology for creating robust and scalable design systems.

The Downward/Upward facing dog is great for starters, but also this quick warm-up. Also, here is a 12-minute hip mobility routine. \nDo the Turkish get up a couple of times, a good start is with a negligible weight or just using your arm. This helps you get start\nA great way to get into the sport is to make it part of a warmup or cooldown routine, for example, warming up with some 50 swings before going about with your regular exercises.\n\nExample Warm Up\n\nStart with some hip mobility, do the alternating 90-degree hip flex and then some upward/downward facing dog movements, the point is to stretch the hips and shoulders.\nDo some swings, and start light. I recommend doing about 50 to 100 swings.\nWork on the clean and snatch, use only simple weights. Do this for ten reps on each side.\nPractice the Turkish getup. Do this for 3-5 times each side. If you are getting started try without weights. Focus on doing it right.\nThis will be a good starting point for kettlebell workouts, when you feel more comfortable make it more of the main workout or do it between heavier sets.\n\nKettlebell Exercises\n\nAmerican Kettlebell swing I like it as it is a more thorough kettlebell exercise than just a normal “Russian” swing.\nNormal Kettlebell Swing The old favourite.

Cooking is art, but baking is more of a science.\nTangzhou\nIn short, the tangzhong method involves cooking a small amount of the recipe’s flour and liquid to form a thick slurry, which is then mixed with the rest of the ingredients to make a basic bread dough.\nThis process pre-gelatinizes the starches in the flour, and as a result, they can absorb more liquid. The result? More moisture in the dough translates to a softer texture in the baked bread and a longer shelf life.\nLink\nSourdough\nLevain - Levain is a type of natural yeast used in baking, particularly in the making of sourdough bread. It’s a mixture of flour and water that has been fermented over a period of time. This fermentation process allows the growth of wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria naturally present in the flour and the surrounding environment.\nThe yeast in the levain causes the dough to rise, while the lactic acid bacteria give the bread its distinctive sour flavor. The process of maintaining a levain involves regular “feedings” of additional flour and water to keep the yeast and bacteria alive and active.\nLevain, also known as a sourdough starter or simply “starter, ” is a traditional method of leavening bread that predates the use of commercial yeast. Many bakers prefer using levain because it enhances the bread’s flavor, texture, and shelf life.\nLinks\n\nSourdough Bagels\nBinging with Babish Sourdough\n\nThoughts\n\nLevain bread is actually used a lot in Sweden, which I found interesting.\nIf you read this, make some scones and tea today and share with a loved one.\n"},"Food/Coffee":{"slug":"Food/Coffee","filePath":"Food/Coffee.md","title":"Coffee","links":[],"tags":["article","food","drinks","drinks/non-alcoholic","health","performance","drugs"],"content":"Coffee\nCoffee is probably the drug I am most comfortable using.

Learn the basics of cutting and get a good knife. A good chefs knife is the most important tool in the kitchen.\n\n\nJulienne: This technique involves cutting food into long, thin strips, resembling matchsticks. Commonly used for vegetables like carrots, celery, or bell peppers, it’s great for stir-fries or garnishes.\n\n\nBrunoise: An extension of the julienne cut, brunoise involves first julienning the food and then dicing it into small cubes (about 1/8 inch). It’s often used for aromatic vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery.\n\n\nChiffonade: This technique is usually used for herbs or leafy vegetables. The leaves are stacked, rolled, and then sliced into thin ribbons. It’s excellent for garnishes or adding herbs to dishes.\n\n\nRangiri: A Japanese cutting technique used particularly for vegetables, where the food is rolled a quarter between cuts to create irregular, angled pieces. This is often used in simmered dishes to help the pieces absorb flavors better.\n\n\nMince: Mincing is chopping food into very small pieces, smaller than a dice. This is often used for garlic, ginger, or herbs, where you want the flavor to be distributed throughout the dish.\n\n\nBatonnet: Similar to julienne but slightly thicker and larger, batonnet cuts are like small sticks. This is often the starting point for dicing into cubes.\n\n\nPaysanne: This involves cutting vegetables into thin, flat pieces. The shapes can vary (round, square, triangular), but they are all uniformly thin. This is often used for layered dishes or stews.\n\n\nDishes\nClean as much as you can during food prep and make it a routine to have the kitchen as clean as possible when you have finished cooking. A little goal of mine is that the only thing that should require cleaning is the things going on the table.\nHaving a quick way of washing single items is good. Try and make a routine where you can quickly wash a couple of utensils or knives between tasks when cooking.\nWashing Machine\nI think having a dishwashing machine is critical, not only do you not have to care about doing the dishes, it also functions as a storage room for dirty dishes. Some things I have learned about using the dishwashing properly.\n\nHaving a dishwasher ready for dirty dishes is important.\nClean your filters regularly.\nYou don’t have to use that much detergent, and also the cheapest option is more than okay.\nHave some detergent in the prewashing cycle, to help clean.\nIf you have any problems, check if anything is blocking the rotating spinning water hoses.\nYou don’t have to rinse the dishes before washing, that’s the job of the dishwasher, just don’t have any food scraps in the dishwasher.\n\nLinks\n\n25 minutes of dishwashing tips\n\nThoughts\n\nA dishwasher is as much a place to store dirty things as a washing machine.\n"},"Food/Recipes/Aglio-e-Olio":{"slug":"Food/Recipes/Aglio-e-Olio","filePath":"Food/Recipes/Aglio e Olio.md","title":"Aglio e Olio","links":["tags/recipe","tags/pasta","tags/italian","tags/quick","tags/favorite-recipe","tags/late-night-delicousness","tags/vegetarian"],"tags":["recipe","pasta","italian","quick","favorite-recipe","late-night-delicousness","vegetarian"],"content":"Tags: recipe pasta italian quick favorite-recipe late-night-delicousness vegetarian\nAglio e Olio\nDescription\nPasta aglio e olio (Pasta with Garlic and Olive Oil) is a simple vegetarian pasta dish\nHow I discovered it.\nI think I randomly discovered it when I first discovered Binging with Babish’s youtube channel.\nIngredients\n\nGarlic, lots of it\nLemon - Like one should be enough for two.\nPasta, spaghetti is the best pasta for this type of pasta.

More specifically, it is often associated with the city of Milan. There are two main variations of Osso Buco: “alla Milanese,” which includes a gremolata (a garnish made from lemon zest, garlic, and parsley) and typically does not include tomatoes, and a more modern version which includes tomatoes and omits the gremolata.\nOsso Buco is traditionally served with either risotto alla Milanese or polenta, depending on the region. The marrow in the bone is considered a delicacy and is often eaten with a small spoon.\nAs for its origins, like many traditional dishes, the exact history is somewhat unclear. It is believed to have been developed in the 19th century, but it’s possible that similar dishes were being made much earlier.

Here, I try to gather my personal knowledge and share it in the best way I know how. This not only helps me learn while working but is also a helpful place for me to gain knowledge and insights, as well as constantly review what I have done to improve each section. The garden might grow new branches, but adding more is not necessarily what I would like to accomplish, I would also like to prune and grow the branches I have. The growth, like in nature should be organic.\nThe garden is by no means a finished work, even my publications of articles are somewhat sketchy, as I have often published unfinished articles that might even be a dummy. However, it is all part of the process of writing and discovering. It is a garden, not a building; it should let its ihabitants live and grow and die naturally.\nAI\nI write a lot about AI, and these are my articles on AI.  Data Science is a sub-phase that I think will be good to go through later.\nI work a lot with data and have tried to figure out the path of a great datacre\nTools and Methods\nI like to try to understand more about Productivity and especially the Theory Behind Productivity. In the Mac and iPhone sections, I talk a little about the tools I use the most, their applications, and other tools in Tools.  Of course, Programming contains much info on programming that I have worked on and learned.\nBooks\nI read a lot, with 72 books read in 2021, 52 in 2022, and 84 books read in 2023. In 2023, I started using Kindle as my primary tool. And I also started using book reviews to read and understand more of what I actually read. The hope is that the book reviews, combined with going back to the book reviews and linking to other books, might make the reviews a more living thing that is constantly growing and evolving (In line with the general principles of the digital garden.)\nBooklist 2023\nList of books with their Book Reviews linked from 2023.\nBooklist 2024\nBooklist from 2024: some of the books have not been read through yet; the books on the list are added as I discover them.\nOther things\nI write a little bit about Mathematics and some thoughts about Thinking and Learning; I think the article on Lectures contains a lot of good information as well.

It changes based on how people expect prices to move over time. Each point on the curve represents a different future delivery date. This helps businesses and traders plan by locking in prices for future transactions.\nA forward curve is the estimation of the price of a good based on futures contracts. So, for example, if the contract is over monthly prices, then you use that, if the contract is over quarters, then you use it. This is because there might not be contracts on a monthly basis.\nA forward curve is for the business in a commodity to understand the different possibilities of the market.

It very nice actually.\nChatfred Chat with chatGPT and Dall-E is very handy for easy questions and image generation.\nBrowse tabs Easy browse tabs in Alfred.\nSpotify: I have not checked it out yet, but having a Spotify player in the Alfred workflow might be interesting.\n\nAlfred Snippets\nAlfred snippets are shortcuts for longer text, and they are easy to add and organize, with folders that can have prefixes, etc. I primarily use some of this for git commands as well as having a quick way of writing long sentences that I currently use.\nAn excellent way to structure the snippets is to have them in different categories so that all programmatic snippets are defined in one way, all abbreviations in another, and so forth.\nAlfred snippets are more complicated than just word expansion, making importing or exporting bulk snippets difficult.\n\nBulk Create snippets\n\nLinks\n\nAlfred workflow for 2-factor auths. Not tried it because I mainly use 2-factor apps.\nAwesome Alfred Workflows\niCal Calendar and Alfred \n\nThoughts\n\nSnippets are exciting and cool, but it is challenging to create a lot of them.\nRaycast is an exciting alternative; it is lighter and more handy than Alfred but is not as customizable.\nAlfred with LLM is cool, it would be nice to explore other possibilities than ChatGPT.\n"},"Mac/Karabiner":{"slug":"Mac/Karabiner","filePath":"Mac/Karabiner.md","title":"Karabiner","links":["-[https:/github.com/searchl=-and-q=filename-percent3Akarabiner.edn-and-type=Code](https:/github.com/searchl=-and-q=filename-percent3Akarabiner.edn-and-type=Code)"],"tags":["article","keyboard-maestro","keyboard-shortcuts","alfred","hotkeys","goku","productivity","productivity-hack","keyboard"],"content":"Karabiner\nKarabiner is a powerful and customizable keyboard remapping tool designed specifically for macOS.

This implies that motivation is not driven by external factors in this definition. By removing external factors, motivation simply becomes a function of want and mental energy.\nLearning curve\nI find the starting phase of learning new things often the most challenging. Getting past the plateau of despair takes time and effort and is often the place where I will fall off.\nDiscipline\nThere is a lot of literature on how to motivate oneself, all of which usually contain some of the same advice in different semantic settings. In my experience, there is just so much mental energy you can apply to do the “right” thing all the time. Doing things because of discipline makes you save this energy.\nRestraint\nI try to exercise restraint to save myself from myself. If the chocolate is in the fridge, I am going to eat it. So if I should not eat chocolate, then I cannot have it in the fridge.\nLearning to Relax\nThe book Four Thousand Weeks Time Management for Mortals is a good book on why you should not always be “on”.  Having some mental break is always good.\nI think a sure recipe for disappointment is being “on” all the time, taking the time not to be a superhero, to be a wreck and eating Ben &amp; Jerry’s on the couch is perfectly normal, as long as it is the exception. It is also a good way of recalibrating the mental mindset. Yes, I did do something that overall was bad for me yesterday but I feel bad and therefore will not continue with this.\nDecision making\nWe are not rational. When making decisions, we, therefore, need to understand the state we are in when making said decisions.  We always make decisions but it is also good to be more focused when making big decisions.\nWhat constitutes a good decision process?\nA good decision process is when there is a decision that has a major effect on my life. When making big decisions, not only do I want to make the right decision, but also be able to look back on the reasoning behind making the decisions. All is clear in hindsight, hindsight is 50/50 etc. I am not concerned about making the right decision in hindsight, I am concerned about making the right decision based on all the information I had available to me at the moment the decision was made.\nWhat makes the decision-making process different from OKRs?  OKRs are more stable goals that influence smaller decisions. For example, limiting alcohol as an OKR influences the decision not to attend the party. Making a decision requires two (or more) potential routes where a choice must be made. OKRs can influence the decision.\nLinks\nDecision-making process\nInversion in decision\nU-Mass Decision Making Process\nFinding Edges\nMoat of Low Status\nLinks\n\n5 common Mental errors for decision making\nOliver Burkman Discusses Productivity on the Peter Attia Podcast \nDo hard things, live an asymmetric life\n\nDo hard things\nDo your thing\nDo it for decades\nWrite your story\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\nI feel like OKRs are best when you have time to validate the progress. When having year-long OKRs you don’t have the possibility to adapt the OKRs to the fact on the ground. Leave the years to strategy and culture, and let OKRs be more on-the-ground concrete things to work on.  As an example, I did an OKR on becoming a writer, and with key results based on articles, but halfway through, I started to work on the digital garden, and the metrics changed.\nAccept that decision-making and motivation are inherently based on emotions. We are emotional creatures, and being logical is therefore quite normal.\nYou should chase the flow state whenever possible, it is the drug of working.

I use it as a tool for writing, for storing information and knowledge, and for remembering. The main point of using obsidian is that it is living on your personal computer, can be treated as a good tool for writing quickly and also can be integrated with a lot of different tools, which probably is a huge advantage.\nPros and Cons\nThe best thing about Obisidian is its ease of customization. The second is how easy it is to store and share the files. It’s all markdown anyway, so fixing them is not that big of a deal.\nI think Obisian is not good as a tool for sharing knowledge and collaboration. It is meant to be a single-user tool. Furthermore, I find it less than useful for writing plain text.\nObsidian for the curious new user.\nStarting obsidian can be a bit difficult, where the amount of customization and possibilities make it difficult to grasp your head around. The advantage of obsidian, however, is that you don’t need a lot of knowledge to get started.  My journey in obsidian started very simply and expanded. Here are some learnings from this journey.\n\nStart with something simple and expand from there.\nI started working mostly using the daily notes feature to create a small overview of things I wanted to do each day. From there on, I expanded and removed unnecessary items. Then, I started working more on a personal knowledge base.\nExperiment with Templates\nTemplates are the natural next step in learning obsidian. By using templates, you can quickly determine what you need.\nMake Obsidian a routine for your daily workflow.\nI combined Obisidian with my Alfred workflow to quickly jot down notes from the day or things I wanted to do. I work a lot on noting down thoughts and use these notes together with tags and some routines to expand. Combined with daily notes, I could quickly write down ideas or others and store them in the Obsidian Vault\nGet familiar with markdown.\nLearn the markdown syntax; it will help you get started quickly. Also, get familiar with hotkeys in Obsidian to get quickly up and running.\nEnjoy and Explore\nOne of the coolest things in Obsidian is the plugins, templates, and workflows that can make your life easier and make Obisidan even more powerful.\n\nRemember, I would reiterate that Obsidian is an awesome tool for working by yourself, but it is not optimal for collaboration. Sharing my notes, posts, and articles was usually difficult (So I made my own webpage to share with others quickly).\nIt is also a bit of a challenge to get up and running, especially if you want to customize early. Copy-pasting templates might be useful, but there are usually some bugs or issues that will leave you debugging for a long time if you copy another person’s template. Take it easy, make it a habit to jot down what you learn, and then add on as necessary.\nThe Digital Garden\nObsidian was a good place to write and record the information. To easily share what I have written, I wanted to create a website where it is easy to navigate and find the things I wanted to share; I made a docusaurus static website. It also helps me revise as I can visit the website on my phone and see what I have written with Fresh Eyes. I feel like this is a good way of recording what I have done and the migrations have been a success for the most part.\nPlugins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugin NameCheckedUsedCommentdataviewYesYesVery cool, but not something one should start with. It is super powerful when you learn it, but it is only effective when you have gained some knowledge and skill using obsidian.

It is also used as a way for me to remember small things and recap my day.\nAt the end of the day, I write a review of the day and score the mood, productivity, and overall score for the day.  The score is between 1 and 10 and is meant to follow a normal distribution, with 5 being a completely average day. The review is helpful to me as I can use it to unwind and look back and reflect on what I did well and what could be improved.\nI find the daily notes to be a helpful and interesting way for me to structure my day, by setting aside time to write down what I have to focus on that day, I  prioritize the day and set a clear goal and structure.\nWeekly review\nEvery Sunday, I try to write down a recap of the week, how the week has been and what I have improved on, and what I need to improve for next week. I also create a weekly goal list that should reflect what I wish to accomplish the next week.\nPlugins\nQuickAdd This is mostly for plugging in templates, I have not experimented a lot with either capture or macros.

It is at its most potent when you can easily create and enlarge your view and allow the plugins to enable you to improve your notetaking little by little.\nIt is not great as a collaboration tool, but the format with markdown files physically makes it hard to sync. And lack of oversight means that I would recommend other tools for working together.\nDon’t be afraid to reduce the templates to a bare minimum. It is easy to add new stuff but usually a harder exercise removing things.\nSometimes the upgrades make it difficult to fix stuff. I had a lot of issues when I made the web-pages. I had to make scripts to make a header at the front of each book review with the title to get the format right.\nEmbrace the fact that you will make a lot of changes, and don’t let an imperfect start stop you from adding to the value.\n\n\nI find the daily and weekly notes to be quite good at making me more focused on the tasks. The daily works more as a journal with some tasks, while the weekly serves as a reminder and review of where I am meant to be.\n\n\nI feel like the more I work in Obsidian, the more I try to simplify and focus on the text above other things.\nTags are cool, and I try to add as many as possible.\nObsidian has a lot of ways of publishing the notes, but it does cost a lot.\nThe more I work on my digital garden, the more I appreciate limiting the templates to the bare minimum. All my templates have gradually been made more concise and less obtuse. This makes it much more accessible to write things in small batches.\nProperties are awesome, but you should strive to keep them simple. However, do not despair; it is quite easy to make simple scripts to add properties to the YAML properties that you can use to update multiple files together. Also, here, the templater plugin and templates are your friends.\n"},"Personal":{"slug":"Personal","filePath":"Personal.md","title":"Personal","links":["Obsidian/Obsidian"],"tags":["article","digital-garden","knowledge-wiki","obsidian"],"content":"Personal\nMy Knowledge Wiki contains most of my knowledge (From 2023 onwards mainly). I gather all information I find interesting and my learnings in this wiki. The goal is to create a digital garden for my thoughts and share as many of the things I find interesting as possible. The goal is to have a comprehensive library for my thoughts and experiences to share with the world and look back on.\nI use Obsidian for most of my digital garden work, but it is not only for digital gardening but also for other things. It is an essential part of the digital garden workflow.\nMethodology\nI believe consistent work and updates are the keys to improvement. I am a fan of trying to make a quick standard with at least some structure that can be expanded upon when making new choices.\nI want to make daily updates as long as possible and have created some incentives to do this.\n\nI have a digital entry reminder to fill in something I have learned during the day, only on weekdays.\nI have a workflow where I try to add something new I have learned and enhance or add to an existing article every day.\n\nWorkflow\nI have designed this basic workflow for making a daily entry and continuously improving the digital garden.\nCAE\nCAE stands for Create, Add, and Enhance and is a task list for daily entries. To work in the digital garden, I use the term item to designate a standalone piece of text. An item should either be an article or a header with some text following it and should be an intelligent and clear piece of text that can be understood separately from other texts.\n\nCreate is that I want to create a new item in my knowledge hub. An Item is either a header or a new article. The goal is always to add new things to the garden.\n\nI do this by having a learning section in my daily note, where the purpose is to write down a paragraph about something new I learned that day. This enables me to easily create new sections or ittems.\n\n\nAdd is when I want to add something to an existing item. It can be a sentence or thought. The goal is to improve all items. If no particular things have been added, then going through the unfinished list is good.\nEnhance is that I should improve either a process or item during the daily entry. A process can be a script used in the digital garden sorting the entries or fixing the style of some articles to the newest style. The goal is to improve the items in the digital garden continuously. The enhancement should be used on a different article than add.\n\nTo add or enhance, I have a custom dataview script that takes entries I have not changed lately and picks out a random article that I can go into and either research something and add it or enhance the article.\nBy using the CAE workflow, I can let the thought of always finishing things go and rather focus on writing for the fun of it.\n\n\n\nThe key to making this work is to automate as much as possible and make sure you are put in a position to succeed. Making reminders, creating scheduled tasks that pop up, or just noting down each time you do some entries or fix things help make it much easier to work consistently.\nProblems and Disadvantages\nI think a lot of the work I do is difficult to immediately assess correctly. Should I have my own data engineering folder? Well, not at the start when data science, AI engineering and ML engineering dominated my work. However, after working for a while, this might change. Also, sometimes I don’t really have to split the articles into granular enough places so that i cannot find the best place to put it.\nI think I would like to have a better way of taking my book notes out of my Booklist folder and having them in other sections. Maybe have them in sections on fiction, classics, machine learning, leadership folders etc. As of 2024, I have not done this, but with over 100 book reviews, it might be a good strategy.\nLinks\n\nAwesome Digital Gardens\n\nThoughts\n\nI want to experiment with randomizing the daily entries, maybe creating a list of enhancements and articles I want to write about, themes, or others.\nOne particular fear I have is a lot of double entries, where I write the same thing repeatedly.\nWorking on this one step at a time is quite fun, and reduces the stress of finishing up.\nI want the digital garden to be a place where I enjoy writing and filling in. It should be a pleasant experience.\nI want to share this with the world, but only when it is large enough to be useful.\nArticles that are not finished are not marked as finished in the header so that I can do some sort of differentiation between articles.  One thing I would like to do is work with dataview and use it to create an unfinished table so that I can use that to finish up unfinished articles.\nAccess to my Mac has been a driver for this. When I worked on an engagement as a consultant, I had issues with writing down and having the normal workflow, which makes it a lot easier to jot down quickly some notes and then later, during the daily review, actually write down more comprehensive thoughts.\n"},"Philosophy/Philosophy":{"slug":"Philosophy/Philosophy","filePath":"Philosophy/Philosophy.md","title":"Philosophy","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Mich/Zen--and--The-Art-of-Motorcycle-Maintenance"],"tags":["article","philosophy","denim-philosophy","absurdism","extensialism","post-modernism","science"],"content":"Philosophy\nSystem Building\n“System building” in philosophy refers to the process of creating a comprehensive and coherent set of ideas or principles that explain various aspects of the world.

He is often considered one of the first advocates for communism, even before the term was coined. Babeuf believed in the abolition of private property and the equal distribution of resources. He argued for a society where wealth and property were shared equally among all citizens, a radical departure from the prevailing political thought of his time. His ideas were influential in the development of socialist and communist thought, and his “Conspiracy of Equals” in 1796 was one of the first organized attempts to establish a communist society. However, this led to his arrest and execution, making him a martyr figure for many future revolutionaries.\nEduard Bernstein\nA prominent figure in the socialist movement and a leading theorist of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He is best known for his development of “revisionist” socialism, which argued for the gradual and democratic reform of capitalism into socialism, rather than a violent revolution. Bernstein believed that the working class could achieve its goals through democratic means within the existing political system. His ideas, often summarized as “evolutionary socialism” or “reformism,” marked a significant departure from the revolutionary socialism of Marx and Engels. Despite criticism from orthodox Marxists, Bernstein’s pragmatic approach had a profound influence on the development of social democracy in Europe.\n\nKnown for: Founding democratic socialism, critique of revolutionary Marxism\nWorks: “Evolutionary Socialism”\n\nRosa Luxemburg\nA pivotal figure in the realm of revolutionary socialism, Rosa Luxemburg was known for her staunch critique of reformism. She believed in the necessity of a revolution to bring about socialism, as opposed to gradual reforms within the existing capitalist system. Her works, such as “The Accumulation of Capital” and “Reform or Revolution”, provide a deep analysis of capitalism and a compelling argument for revolutionary socialism. A lot of soixante-huitards identified with the Luxenburg-Trotskist thought of communism.\n\nKnown for: Revolutionary socialism, critique of reformism\nWorks: “The Accumulation of Capital”, “Reform or Revolution”\n\nAntonio Gramsci\nAntonio Gramsci is renowned for his theory of cultural hegemony, which posits that the ruling class maintains power not just through violence or economic coercion, but also ideologically, through a shared sense of what is ‘common sense’ or ‘natural’. He was also instrumental in founding the Italian Communist Party. His “Prison Notebooks”, written while he was imprisoned by the Fascist regime in Italy, are considered seminal works in Marxist philosophy and political theory.\n\nKnown for: Theory of cultural hegemony, founding the Italian Communist Party\nWorks: “Prison Notebooks”\n\nMichael Harrington:\nKnown for his influence on democratic socialism in the United States, Michael Harrington brought attention to poverty in America with his groundbreaking work, “The Other America”. He argued that democratic socialism was the best way to address social inequality.

As I am only one person, I must maximize the amount of work I can do to the greatest extent possible.\nOne of the most important things you can do to maximize your productivity is to understand how you learn most efficiently, and from then on, make sure to put yourself in an excellent opportunity to learn.\nLearning is best when you can continuously bounce ideas back and forth with peers or tutors. My greatest learning moments have been in such situations.\nFocus\nMuch has been talked about deep focus and the flow state that makes time pass away, and you are very productive. Sometimes, the flow state can be overrated as you are in the learning phase, where you know a lot of the things you are working on and, therefore, can be more efficient. I think getting a grasp of unfamiliar concepts is incompatible with a state of flow.\nFlow\nDefinition:\nFlow is a state of complete absorption in an activity, where an individual is so engrossed in the task at hand that they lose track of time and their surroundings. During this state, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and total involvement with life.\nConditions for Flow:\n\nChallenge-Skill Balance: One of the primary triggers for a flow state is the right balance between the task’s challenge and the performer’s skill. If the task is too easy, it can lead to boredom; if it’s too hard, it can lead to anxiety.\nClear Goals: The activity has clear goals and objectives.\nImmediate Feedback: The person receives immediate feedback about their performance, allowing for adjustments and improvements.\n\nCharacteristics of the Flow Experience:\n\nConcentration: A high level of concentration on a limited field of attention.\nLoss of Self-Consciousness: A loss of reflective self-awareness.\nTransformation of Time: One’s subjective experience of time is altered; hours might seem like minutes.\nSense of Control: Feeling control over one’s actions and environment.\nMerging of Action and Awareness: One’s actions and awareness merge, making the activity automatic.\nIntrinsic Motivation: The activity becomes intrinsically rewarding, meaning the experience is the primary reward.\nLoss of Awareness of Physical Needs: Reduced awareness of bodily needs like hunger or fatigue.\n\nApplications:\nUnderstanding flow has numerous applications, especially in enhancing the quality of life, improving performance in various fields (from sports to arts to work), and in educational settings to make learning more engaging.\nBarriers to Flow:\nDistractions, lack of clear goals, insufficient challenge, and lack of immediate feedback can prevent one from entering the flow state.\nLinks\n\nSpeed Matters\n30-30-30 Framework\nWhen First Principles Thinking Fails\nPaul Graham on Great Work\nStop Work So Hard\nWorking Offline with Docs (Zeal)\nCult of Done Manifesto\nAI-Enhanced Development\nProductivity Velocity.

Dart is developed by Google and is a compiled static-typed language. Most of the development with Dart is for the Flutter framework.\nTypes and Definitions\nTypes\n\nnum: It’s an abstract type that has two subclasses namely int (integer values) and double (64-bit floating-point numbers).\n\n\nint: As stated, this is used for integer values. For example, int age = 18;\ndouble: This is used for decimal numbers. For example, double pi = 3.14;\nString: This is used for a sequence of characters. For example, String name = &quot;Alice&quot;;\nbool: This is used for Boolean values, which can be either true or false. For example, bool isOnline = true;\nList: Also known as Array in other languages, it is used to represent a collection of items. For example, List&lt;int&gt; ages = [18, 20, 22];\nSet: This is a collection of unique items. It’s similar to List but it doesn’t contain duplicate values. For example, Set&lt;int&gt; uniqueAges = {18, 20, 22};\nMap: This is used for a collection of key-value pairs. For example, Map&lt;String, int&gt; nameToAge = {&#039;Alice&#039;: 18, &#039;Bob&#039;: 20};\nRunes: In Dart, strings are a sequence of UTF-16 code units. If you want to express Unicode code points within a string, use the runes type.\nSymbol: This type represents an operator or identifier declared in a Dart program. They are seldom used but can be crucial in meta-programming or when using reflections.\nvoid: This is a special type in Dart that is used to represent the return type of a function when the function doesn’t return a value. In other words, if a function is to perform some work that doesn’t need to produce a result, void is used as the return type.\n\nKeywords for variables\nvar, final, and const are variable declaration keywords. They help in defining and controlling the properties of variables in Dart.\nfinal: This keyword is used when you want a variable to be set only once and then prevent any future modifications. It means that a final variable can only be set once and it must be initialized when it’s declared. It’s important to know that final is evaluated at runtime, which allows you to calculate the value dynamically.\nvar: This is a keyword used to declare a variable without specifying its type. The Dart language is smart enough to infer the type of the variable from the assigned value, so you don’t have to explicitly mention it every time. However, once a variable holds a value, its type is set and can’t be changed.\nconst: This keyword is similar to final in that it’s used to represent a constant value that can’t be changed. The difference is that const values are defined at compile-time, which means you can’t assign a dynamic value to a const variable.\nFlutter\nFlutter is a framework for developing cross-platform applications. It is built upon the Dart language.\nFlutter is supported by Google.\nProvider Package\nI think the provider package is very useful for handling state and state-related things.\nLinks\n\nSteve Yegge on Flutter\nRobert Brunhage has a lot of good tutorials\nFlutter Introduction\nStateful vs Stateless\nFlutter Roadmap\n\nThoughts Brundage\n\nFlutter introduced me to the trials of state, which, when I started, became one of the hardest things to understand and work with.\nKnowing all the widgets in Flutter is not the most important thing; instead, understanding the data flow is essential.\nThe most important thing to remember is CRUD and State.

This means most of the work to create the HTML for the component happens on the server, not in the user’s browser.\nThe fundamental difference between Server Components and Client Components in Next.js lies in where they are primarily executed. Server Components run mainly on the server, where they render HTML, fetch data directly, and send that minimal output to the browser. Client Components run in the user’s browser, handling interactions, state updates, and dynamic aspects of the page after the initial content is received.\nPages, Layouts, and Templates\nWhen building a website using Next.js, the framework automatically generates routes based on the files in your “pages” directory. For instance, a file named pages/about.tsx becomes the route /about, while a file named pages/blog/post.tsx becomes the route /blog/post. To create dynamic routes matching different values, use square brackets [] in the file names. For example, a file named pages/blog/[postId].js will match routes like /blog/1, /blog/hello-world, etc.\nThe dynamic part, postId, can be accessed in your code to fetch and display the corresponding content.\nA layout is a UI that is shared between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. The root layout is defined at the top level of the app directory and applies to all routes. This layout is required and must contain html and body tags, allowing you to modify the initial HTML returned from the server.\nThere may be cases where you need those specific behaviors, and templates would be a more suitable option than layouts. For example:\n\nFeatures that rely on useEffect (e.g., logging page views) and useState (e.g., a per-page feedback form).\nTo change the default framework behavior. For example, Suspense Boundaries inside layouts only show the fallback the first time the Layout is loaded and not when switching pages.

This encoding is used when there is a need to encode binary data, especially in circumstances where the communication or storage medium only supports text, such as in emails or some older file systems.\nThis is useful when you need to send or expose files as a text string or other (type API/JSON).\n\nEncoding: In Base64 encoding, the binary data is divided into 6-bit blocks. Each block is then mapped to a specific character from the Base64 character set (which includes A-Z, a-z, 0-9, ’+’, ’/’, and sometimes ’=’ for padding). This process converts the binary data into a text string, making it easier to handle in text-based systems.\nDecoding: Decoding is the reverse process where the Base64 encoded text is converted back into its original binary form. This is necessary because the actual binary data is needed for processing or displaying (like rendering an image in a browser).\n\nBasic Concepts of Asynchronous Programming\n\nSynchronous Programming: Traditionally, most programming is synchronous, meaning tasks are performed one after another. Each task must complete before the next one starts.\nAsynchronous Programming: In contrast, asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be processed in an overlapping manner. It’s particularly useful for tasks that involve waiting (like waiting for data from a network), as it allows other tasks to run in the meantime.\n\nHow async Works\n\n\nCreating a Coroutine: When you define a function with async def, it becomes a coroutine. It’s important to note that simply defining a coroutine does not execute it.\n\n\nAwaiting a Coroutine: To execute the coroutine, you must await it. The await keyword is used to pause the coroutine’s execution and wait for its result.\n\n\nThe Event Loop: The core of asynchronous programming in Python is the event loop. When you await a coroutine, the event loop handles its execution. It schedules the coroutine’s tasks and resumes their execution when the awaited operation (like an I/O task) is complete.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n\n"},"Programming/Programming":{"slug":"Programming/Programming","filePath":"Programming/Programming.md","title":"Programming","links":[],"tags":["article","programming","computers","computer-science","python","rust","dart"],"content":"Programming\nComputers\nAn underrated aspect of programming is understanding computers; for engineers and self-taught programmers, it might be challenging to understand the intricacies of computers.\nCPU course, what is a CPU It is written by high-schoolers, so it is an exciting read.\nAPI\nHow does one explain an API in a good way? It is quite a broad subject. On the one hand, what I first thought of as an API is just how you can talk with other computers through the internet; when people said there is an API for that, they meant that someone had made a database or service that you could get the data for. However, an API is more than that; it is a method of interfacing with other programs. The Python programming language is an API, and when I use a library from Microsoft or AWS, I use their API.\nTo me, thinking of an API as a contract is a useful metaphor. This ‘contract’ ensures that if you make a request in a specific, agreed-upon format, you will receive a predictable response. An API is a structurally agreed-upon way for two programs to interact with each other.\n\nFree Public API that are tested every day\n\nLinks\n\nUncle Bob sessions on Clean Code Interesting high-level talks on code and code writing and programming.

It is very easy to learn and it is good when designing apis.\nSecurity Layer FastAPI\nAPI key and Depends can be used to create a validation layer. The API key can be imported by fastapi. security and is used to authenticate the api. However, you need to include it in the codebase. This is just one of many ways to use FastAPI to take care of authentication.\nfrom fastapi.security.api_key import APIKeyHeader\nfrom fastapi import Security, HTTPException\nfrom starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN\napi_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name=&quot;access_token&quot;, auto_error=False)\nasync def get_api_key(api_key_header: str = Security(api_key_header)):\n    if api_key_header == API_KEY: # secret value\n        return api_key_header\n    else:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail=&quot;Could not validate API KEY&quot;\n        )\n\nAPIKeyHeader(name=&quot;access_token&quot;, auto_error=False): This creates an instance of the APIKeyHeader class, which represents an API key security scheme where the key is sent in the headers of the request. The name argument is the name of the header where the API key should be found and auto_error=False means that FastAPI won’t automatically raise an exception if the API key is missing or invalid.\nSecurity(api_key_header): This creates a dependency that FastAPI will inject into the get_api_key function. FastAPI will look for an API key in the headers of the request and pass it to get_api_key as the api_key_header argument.\nget_api_key(api_key_header: str = Security(api_key_header)): This is an asynchronous function that takes the API key from the request headers (injected by FastAPI) and checks if it matches the expected API key. If the keys match, the function returns the key; otherwise, it raises an HTTPException with a 403 status code to indicate that the request is forbidden.\n\nLayered Architecture\nI like to separate API into “layers,” where each step is its own layer in the API.  Then for each API, I can have all the logic within the same folder.\nLayered architecture in an API refers to a structured approach where the application is divided into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and roles. This architectural style promotes separation of concerns, making the application more organized, scalable, and maintainable. The most common layers include the presentation, business logic, and data access layers.\n\nThe presentation layer is responsible for interacting with the client, such as web browsers or mobile applications, handling user inputs, and presenting data.\nThe business logic layer, or domain layer, contains the application’s core functionality, processing commands, making logical decisions, and performing calculations. It acts as a mediator between the presentation and data access layers, ensuring that user inputs are processed according to the business rules.\nThe data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any data storage system. It handles all the data retrieval and storage operations, abstracting the complexity of these operations from the business logic layer.\n\nI structure the layers in FastAPI like this.\n\nRouter Layer: This is the layer where you define your API endpoints (routes). It acts as the interface between the outside world and your application. Here, HTTP requests are received, and the appropriate controller actions are invoked.\nModels Layer: This layer is responsible for representing your application’s data structures. In the context of an API connected to a database, models typically represent tables in your database.

It is designed to provide better compression ratios compared to other compression algorithms like Gzip and Deflate, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster transmission of data over the network.\nWhen BrotliMiddleware is used in a web application, it intercepts the HTTP responses generated by the application and compresses them using the Brotli algorithm before sending them back to the client. This helps to reduce the size of the response, resulting in faster page load times and improved performance.\nBrotliMiddleware can be easily integrated into web frameworks and servers that support middleware components. It typically works by adding the middleware to the application’s middleware pipeline, which allows it to process the HTTP responses before they are sent back to the client.\nfrom brotli_asgi import BrotliMiddleware\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\napp = FastAPI()\napp.add_middleware(BrotliMiddleware)\nLinks\n\nFastAPI Articles\n\nThoughts\n\nA 2xx response means the request was correct; a 4xx means the client did something wrong, and a 5xx means the server did something wrong.\n"},"Programming/Python/Pytest":{"slug":"Programming/Python/Pytest","filePath":"Programming/Python/Pytest.md","title":"Pytest","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Programming/Python/Python-Testing-with-pytest"],"tags":["article","TDD","python","testing","software-testing","programming"],"content":"Pytest\nPytests is a wrapper around the unit test python test framework. It makes it a bit easier to write tests.\nDecorators\nFixtures\n@pytest.fixture are a powerful feature of PyTest that allows you to set up some code to run before a test starts, and/or after a test ends. They are used to abstract away setup and cleanup code that may be needed for tests, thereby promoting code reuse and keeping the tests clear and concise. Fixtures can be modular, so you can define them once and use them across multiple tests or even test modules.\nHere’s a simple example in a markdown code block:\n```python\nimport pytest\n \n# Define a fixture\n@pytest.fixture\ndef example_fixture():\n    data = {&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}\n    yield data\n    data.clear()  # Cleanup code, runs after the test using this fixture\n \ndef test_example(example_fixture):  # Include the fixture as an argument\n    assert example_fixture[&quot;key&quot;] == &quot;value&quot;\n\nThe @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) decorator in pytest is used to automatically apply a fixture to all tests without having to manually include them in the test function parameters.\nThe conftest.py file serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire directory. Fixtures defined in a conftest.py can be used by any test in that package without needing to import them (pytest will automatically discover them).\n\nMark Decorators\nMarks in pytest are a way to categorize tests. You can mark a test function with custom metadata like slow, fast, requires_db, etc. This can be useful when you want to run a specific subset of tests.\nHere’s how you can use marks:\n@pytest.mark.slow\ndef test_slow_function():\n    ...\n \n@pytest.mark.requires_db\ndef test_database_function():\n    ...\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize: Allows you to run a test function multiple times with different arguments.\n@pytest.mark.skip: Marks a test function as skipped, which means it won’t be run.\n@pytest.mark.skipif: Marks a test function to be skipped if a certain condition is true.\n@pytest.mark.xfail: Marks a test function as expected to fail. If the test passes, it’s reported as an unexpected success.\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures: Specifies that a test function should use a fixture, even if the fixture isn’t passed in as an argument.\n\nFastAPI\nFastAPi has its own test functionality. It preserves many states, like authentication, and makes it much easier to test. I think it is nice to create a new project and play around with testing a lot.\nOne of the hardest, or maybe not hardest, but definitely most cumbersome things to get good at is authentication and state management. This leads to a lot of issues.  So, I recommend trying a bit without those issues to learn the basics.\nLinks\n\nQuick overview of mocks\nAnatomy of a test\nUse Weird Tests to capture tacit knowledge\nPython Testing with pytest\n\nThoughts\n\nNot always easy to configure tests in VSCode.

Furthermore, I also want to highlight some cool places that are interesting and nice to visit but also not only focusing on larger, bigger things, but more hidden gems.\nOslo city is very small. I think you can travel very well just by using your own to pair your feet something that might be a good solution in summer times provided that it’s not raining. It’s actually using the El-Scooters. Those bikes are handy. There are a lot of them, and the infrastructure for biking is quite developed in Oslo city. However, there are a lot of hills so it might be kind of exhausting to bicycle the normal way, but also quite okay.\nBest Experiences\nOne of the best things in oslo is the closeness to nature. And depending on the season, there are a lot of great things to do.\nIn the summertime, early autumn, and late spring, I think being able to go out in the fjord and explore is very nice.  Go to VisitOslo to see the island and how to get there.\nAlso, I can highly recommend, if you are up to a mini-walk/hike, to walk up from Storo to Grefsenkollen. (You can also take the bus, but it is not that long of a walk (1 hour)).\nIf you like to do some walks in Oslo, follow the Akerselva trail, it is a quite nice walk and you can see a lot of the city.  Gems along the River\nFood\nLots of good options for different food in Oslo, and there are few things that might be nice to know.\n\nTips are not something that is mandatory, so dont feel obligated to tip.\nFood is generally expensive, as all things in Norway.\n\nRestaurant Map\nBased on a friends list of maps, divided by sections fo\nAsian Cuisine\n\nIzakaya Classis Izakaya resturnat. Feels like you are in Tokyo, and it has good and reasonable food. Probably my favorite restaurant in Oslo. A bit difficult to find as there are no official signs or other markings. Also, no way to reserve a table. It is worth waiting for, for sure.\nKanpai is Also an Izakay-style resturant. Also quite good but more posh.

It is very far north, and it is cold there. It is also an excellent place to go skiing.  Sapporo is quite a big City, Niseko is more of a village with skiing slopes and some large resorts nearby.\nBest Experiences\nSome of the best experiences in Sapporo were experiencing the “true” Japanese food scene and culture. There are a lot of incredible experiences there, and it is a fascinating place because it feels very Western but is so different.\nI remember very clearly the tiny streets packed with Ramen shops, how polite people were, the need for cash, and how everything from the toilets to the ski lifts had a speaker that communicated with you.\nNiseko had an exciting and cool downhill skiing scene, and I enjoyed the JaPOW immensely. Also, the warming cabins and small restaurants had fantastic places.\nSouvenirs\nGoing for some Ramen gear would be very smart; I bought not that many things other than warm clothes (Traveling from Singapore had some disadvantages). Also, some super cool commercials for Sapporo Bear from the Brewery Museum of Sapporo Pilsner would be awesome.\n\nSapporo Beer Musuem\n\nFood\nThe food was one of the best things from my trip. The best, or the most fascinating, was going to a sake bar followed by a super old-school sushi restaurant.\n\nSake Bar. Tasting different types of sake was an excellent experience.\nSushi Bar: This is maybe the right place, but this was a recommendation from the Sake Bartender for a good sushi place, and man, did it live up to expectations. One of my favorite experiences in Japan is eating authentic sushi made by a chef with about 40 years of experience.\nRamen Street is a Very cool place to go and have ramen. Traditional ramen places from the birthplace of ramen. There are lots of Ramen shops, and some have long lines.\n\nNiseko places\n\nThe Barn by ODIN looked like a cool place; I did not go there myself, but it was a high-end diner that I liked and thought was fantastic to visit.\nTozanken Ramen is a trendy ramen place with long lines.\nI was at Cafe Cubanons almost every day. Took it as a lunch. A cubanos with a Sapporo pilsner was a fantastic break from the slopes.  All the employees looked to be Australian (mullets and mustaches). It was also the same place as a physical therapist for some weird reason.\n\n\nLinks\n\nOnsen Baths Found in Niseko. Very hot and nice after a long day skiing.

I think some of the best experiences are related to immersion in the different cultures at the heart of the city-state.  Chinatown and Little India are definitely places I can recommend.\nAlso, visit East Coast Park when there is a sunset. Watching the lights of the hundreds of ships in the strait is definitely an experience of a lifetime.\nA Singapore visit is definitely not complete without a visit to:\n\nGardens by the Bay is a Very cool place to visit. Go and see the light show and from there go to Marina Bay Sands and take a drink.\nEast Coast Park Go there at sundown and then see the ships in Singapore Straight light up. Also fun for running exercises.\n\nAfter-Work Hangouts in Singapore\nIf you’re looking to relax after a long day or simply want to explore Singapore’s vibrant nightlife, here are some must-visit spots:\n\nSmith Street Taps\n\nDescription: An excellent spot for craft beer enthusiasts, Smith Street Taps is located within the bustling Chinatown Food Complex. It offers a rotating selection of craft beers on tap.\nLocation: Chinatown\n\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nDescription: Inspired by the famous novel, this brewery offers a wide range of craft beers, each with its own unique story.

Grab is primarily a transportation app in Singapore, similar to Uber.\nWhy should you care? It’s one of the most convenient ways to get around the city. You can also use it as an alternative to cash some places.\nAction Step: Download the Grab app and make sure to add your payment card to it.\n\n\n\nCash:\n\nWhat is it? Physical money, of course! But in Singapore, it’s particularly important at hawker centers.\nWhy should you care? While many places in Singapore accept card payments, hawker centers (popular open-air food courts) often operate on cash or app-based payments.\nAction Step: Ensure you have cash on hand, especially when visiting hawker centers. A typical meal usually costs between 5 and 10 dollars, depending on drinks and other add-ons.\n\n\n\nClothing:\n\nWhat is it? A reminder about the indoor climate.\nWhy should you care? While Singapore has a tropical climate, indoor areas like offices can be quite chilly due to air conditioning.\nAction Step: It’s smart to pack a light sweater or some warm clothing. You might need it, especially in office settings. It is also nice on flights as well.\n\n\n\nImmigration:\n\nWhat is it? You need to submit an immigration declaration among other things before arriving.  Note: Only 2 days before can you fill it in.\nWhy should you care? It is annoying to do this when arriving and tired.\nAction Step: Fill inn\n\n\n\nFood\n\nChili Crab- National dish of Singapore, a super nice dish that is perfect to\nLaksa - My favorite dish to have in Singapore.\nChar Siew- Kinda cool, very easy to make as well.\nZion Food Center by GWC has very good dumplings.\nAyer Rajah Food Court\nKeng Eng Seafood is great for chili crab dinners.

I wanted a place to share what I had learned with the wider world. Secondly, it was more of a learning experience creating and maintaining the web page over time.\nObsidian\nMy go-to knowledge-gathering and note-taking app is Obsidian. Obsidian lets me quickly gather notes in a structured format and have standard methods for linking notes together, having tags, and a more structured way of learning.\nA big issue is structuring migrations from obsidian to the github. For me, it was a bit more of difficult setting to migrate the data from one place to another. Furthermore,\nDocusaurus\nDocusaurus is a library based on the React framework and is used to display the page. One advantage of docusaurus is that I can work in obsidian and then migrate those to the repo with the code. I can also separate the different pages that are personal and those that I would like to share.\nAlso, Docusaurus enables me to learn more about JavaScript and development in React.  I found it very easy to deploy and make the web page, making it much more rewarding to work on development.  ¨\nRandom Page\nI want to write a little bit about the random page funcitonaliyty i impolemented in docusaurus. I think this is a good thing to write about becuase it highlights some of the struggles of a developer.\nI started with making a prompt for creating a docusaurus random page, and after the message from the LLM was kind of vague I did a little bit of research into the topic.\nI use react for creating components and therefore it seemed like a good choice to look a bit into how a react component was made. However, it seemed to be quite difficult for me to use the lists dynaimcally, and I decided to create a list of articles using a bash shell script for creating the articles list and then reference that one in react. Kind of a hazzle I know but it seemed to me a path of least resistance, and for the issues of the scripts, well, I have to run scripts anyways.\nAfter I made the list, which was a text file, I had issues parsing the file in the react component (Also made quickly with LLM support). I then thought, why not use JSON instead. I also then could add a title. The script for making the list in JSON ended up looking like this:\n#! /bin/bash\nfind docs -type f -name &quot;*.md&quot; | sed &#039;s/\\.md$//&#039; | awk -F/ -v q=&#039;&quot;&#039; &#039;BEGIN {\n    print &quot;[&quot;\n}\nfunction join(array, start, end, sep,    result, i) {\n    result = array[start];\n    for (i = start + 1; i &lt;= end; i++) {\n        result = result sep array[i];\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n{\n    # Replace spaces with %20 (URL encoding).\n    gsub(/ /, &quot;%20&quot;, $0);\n \n    # Split the path into parts.\n    n = split($0, parts, &quot;/&quot;);\n \n    # Determine the title.\n    title = parts[n];\n    gsub(/%20/, &quot; &quot;, title); # Revert %20 to spaces for title display.\n \n    # Handle the case where the parent folder and file name are the same.\n    if (n &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; parts[n] == parts[n-1]) {\n        path = join(parts, 1, n-1, &quot;/&quot;);\n    } else {\n        path = $0;\n    }\n \n    # Print the JSON object line.\n    print (NR&gt;1 ? &quot;,&quot; : &quot;&quot;) &quot;  {\\&quot;path\\&quot;: \\&quot;&quot; path &quot;\\&quot;, \\&quot;title\\&quot;: \\&quot;&quot; title &quot;\\&quot;}&quot;;\n}\nEND {\n    print &quot;\\n]&quot;\n}&#039; &gt; static/article_list.json\nQuite complicated, yes?\nThen, I managed after struggling with removing one part of the path and generally acting like a GPT monkey, punching in the code from ChatGPT and pasting in error without any thoughts whatsoever. This was annoying.\nAfter making a separate component, realizing it was not a good way to make it (As it should be part of the overview page and could be reused there), making a custom function for it instead, making it work, and then realizing it worked locally but failed deployment to the cloud (FML).  Then it was debugging in the npm run build. Hooray!!!!!\nI finally realized the error, as I did\nconst response = await fetch(&#039;@site/static/article_list.json&#039;);\nconst articles = response.json();\nBut It should have been\nconst articles = require(&#039;@site/static/article_list.json&#039;);\nI wrapped my head around the concept of async for the nth time, and then it was there. I guess I am a fully-fledged senior front-end developer.\nThe takeaway from this charming story of an undisturbed evening is the following:\n\nA solution is first hacky, then generalized, and then elegant. With all things requiring both thought and skill.\nNot understanding the output of LLM is bad. Trying to understand the output of LLM is good; understanding the output is better.\n\nVercel\nIn Vercel, you get to deploy quickly, and they have free hosting for some development. I was astonished at how super easy they deployed the page. It was an eureka moment. Making the deployment easy makes it more rewarding to focus on writing code.\nGithub\nThe code is on GitHub, as it is easy to create a repo and contains all the code and docs that should be available in the application. This repo separates the code from\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\nI am very pleased with how I worked on this project; I think it has been a good journey so far, and I hope to learn a lot more and share a lot more when it comes to working on the different things I try to learn.\nVercel is a super duper awesome product.\nThe ease of deployment is important; just type a command, and you get a new web page.

You should aim to have a lasting positive impact on your client. An investment in you as a consultant should be like an investment in a stock; it should pay dividends for a long time after the initial investment.\nOnboarding\nOnboarding is a critical phase of your engagement with clients.  Make sure that you have an onboarding plan as quickly as possible. Reach out to colleagues already in engagements at that company to find insights and figure out the minutia of the company.\nA lot of the issues with getting an account and getting access to materials and accounts often require steps or “hacks” that are not documented.

They decide if your delivery is a success or not.\nTypes of stakeholders.\n\n\nGatekeepers: These stakeholders control access to critical people or systems. Their purpose is to regulate who gets access to resources and ensure that protocols are followed.  Examples of gatekeepers are IT departments, HR, and product owners of various applications.\n\n\nResources: These individuals or teams are responsible for executing tasks and getting things done. They are essential for project implementation and progress.\n\n\nAuthorizers: These stakeholders have the authority to sign off on decisions and provide formal leadership. They are often in charge of approving budgets, timelines, and major project milestones.\n\n\nNetwork Nodes: These are the connectors within the organization, possessing a wide range of contacts and relationships. They are key for navigating the organizational landscape and building alliances.\n\n\nTech Influencers: These stakeholders have deep technical knowledge and influence over technology-related decisions. They can guide the direction of technical choices and innovations.\n\n\nSponsors: These are high-level executives who provide strategic direction and support for the project. They are often responsible for securing funding and championing the project within the organization.  Keep Sponsors informed of the project’s progress, highlighting achievements and how they align with strategic goals. Sponsors might be quite busy so be aware that their time is critical and their knowledge of the particular project is limited.\n\n\nUpstream adn Downstream Stakeholders\nUpstream stakeholders are individuals who are involved in the implementation of the program or offering the decision has set forth. Downstream stakeholders are individuals who will receive, use, or participate in the program or offering the decision has set forth. The downstream stakeholders can be directly or indirectly impacted. Direct impactees are typically employees within the program or offering for which the decision was made, while indirect impactees are typically external to the organization or group.\nLinks\n\nThe Trusted Advisor Book on consulting.\nThe difference that makes the difference\nConsulting Articles from a person in the AI space\nSecrets of Consulting: Another book on consulting\nNeed Money?\nThe most common mistake consultants make is not becoming a strategic advisor to the client. \n\nTake the opportunity to build a strategic client relationship beyond contracted work scope.\nBe opportunistic, and aim to be a go-to for clients.\nGet them talking.\nWhat clients value more than analysis is solutions and creative workarounds.\nUphold credibility and put the client first.\nBe realistic about work-life balance - it is a competitive industry.\nPositivity is contagious.

You will get a lot of goodwill if you lessen the onboarding workload for the stakeholders.\nCommunication is everything.\nSome things are easier to deal with as a consultant, and some things are more difficult. Getting access and permissions are definetly in the latter part.\nYour stakeholders might be more interested in progress than results. So giving them continous updates and showing your work might buy you a lot of time.

Interviewing is 90 % practice.\nThe purpose of this practice is to focus on how to answer a question rather than what to answer. Let’s break this down a bit. If you receive a question related to communicating with other departments, you should already know what to answer; you cannot invent an answer to this question on the spot; it should be clear what you should answer. The ‘how’ is dependent on the situation; it is situation-specific. This is where you need to focus your attention and energy. When you practice, you automatize the what and can concentrate on the how.\nCan you remember to smile when you don’t know what you are going to say?\nTell Stories\nHumans are storytelling people; we communicate by using stories. Therefore, a focus area should be creating good stories with a clear purpose. These stores are what you can base your answers on.\nGood frameworks for telling stories are STAR and CAR\nIt is so important with these types of frameworks to know the answers to them in a good way. To make sure you are properly prepared, make a list of common questions and make a STAR or CAR for each one. This will help you a lot when you do practice interviews and real interviews.\nTell me about yourself.\nThis question is extremely important to have down, it will probably always come up and is one of the most important questions you will answer. It is at the start of the interview and is probably about the time a lot of interviewers decide if they are going to hire you or not.\nFramework\nUse the present, past, and future framework.\n\nThe past - what is your background and relevant work experience? How did you get to where you are now?\nThe present - what is your current role? What do you do and what are your top accomplishments?\nThe future - what are you looking to do next? Why are you interested in the position? I think the future should also be Tied to the why questions: Why this company? Why this job? Why this field?\n\nIt is even more important that you focus on practicins this questions and understand how to better tailor the question to the specific interview. I also think it would be really smart to write down a lot of answers, maybe have a doucment where you have some notes on how to answer this well.\nThis is a good starting point for the TMAY\n\nMake sure you alwaus have answers to the why questions.\nIf you are going to have some personal touch, it is in the present part of the TMAY.\nI always like to finish with a question, make the people talk about the job, people like to talk about themselves.\nTry to keep the answer brief.\nKeep work the main part of the answer. You are allowed to brag a little bit.\n\nMock Interviews\nMock interviews are a good way of becomming familiar with interviewing. Remember; Being good at interviewing is 90 % practice.  You need to work on your interviewing skills if you are to become good at interviewing.\nComplete Mock Interview.\nThe goal of a complete mock interview is to gain a familiarity towards the entire interview process and focus on having the time to focus on the entire way you do interviewing. Moreover, an eventual evaluation is of the complete interview, where more of the soft part of the interview can be properly evaluated.  Make sure to include the small talk, the greating and the follow out of the lobby to evaluate the entire process.\nSparring Interview\nSparring interviews differs from a complete mock interview in that the interview setting is more loose, and that each single question is reviewed.\nSparring interviews are more fast and focus on repetition. You can nail down the answers to the questions with repeated focus. This is particullary imporatnant for the the big four interview questions (Why this industry, why this organization, why this job and tell me about yourself (TMAY))\nA good plan for interview sessions are to do sparring interviews until the techincal bits are seamless and the big four questions are also down to a tee. Then you find example job postings and role play the entire interview.\nResume\nYou should not use more than 4 hours on the resume. In The Job Closer, the research highlights that the average time spent on a resume is measured in seconds, not minutes or hours, seconds.\n\nA resume should be correct.\nA resume should show outcomes.\nA resume is clean and easily readable.\n\nLinks\n\nThe Job Closer: I read this book and found it interesting.\nWebsite about interviewing.\nHN: Discussion around the topic\nJoel On interviewing version 3\nGet hired as an engineering manager\nBook on the tech resume for developers or people in tech in general\nCasey Handmer on interview/Resume etc (SNR: Signal-Noise-Ratio)\n\n\nThoughts\n\nA resume should be clean above all else.\n “Competence Triggers: basically, if you have to judge someone’s skill based on a series of brief interactions, you’re going to pattern match their behavior against other people who you like.  When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of people like them who live and breathe this business thing.  They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company.  Volunteering a number when asked says the same thing to people with hiring authority that flunking FizzBuzz says to an engineer: this person may be a wonderful snowflake in other regards, but on the thing I care about, they’re catastrophically incompetent.” - Patrick McKenzie.\nPractice the questions you do not have the answer to, not the ones that you do. I had this experience once while practicing for an interview, and I only saw what I knew when practicing, foregoing what I did not know. This is a human tendency, and you should focus on things you do not know. How do you answer them?\nIf having a virtual meeting, make sure to book a room beforehand that is booked not only for the duration of the meeting but also some time before the meeting.\nPractice your pitch (Aka, tell me about yourself) as much as possible; this needs to be top-notch.\nWhen considering a job switch, make sure that you understand the future aspects and the fact that the future your boss and management promise you is what it is, just words.  Show me the money (Note: See Salary Negotiation)\nIt is what the money says. Do not do it for the money; do it for what the money says. It says you are worth it.\nBe prepared for uncomfortable, rude, and even illegal questions in an interview. Those who interview you are not that well-trained and might not know or even care about what they are allowed to ask in an interview.\nOne of the only things that was slightly predictive of on-the-job success was grammar and spelling.

Repeat: Time is the killer of deals.\n\nDon’t reveal any information.\n\nDon’t ever name the first number.\n\nThere are a lot of advantages to being the last to act.\nThey have all the information; you need to stack the cards in your favor.\nWhat to say instead: “At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first-right now I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I also promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.”\n\n\nDon’t reveal any information about who else you’re talking to or how far along you are in the job process at other places.\nA good line: I am talking to a few companies, at various stages. Nothing is finalized; I will let you know before I make a few big decisions.\nThink of a recruiter as someone whose job is to collect information they can ONLY use against you.  (Think of Miranda Rights for recruiting)\n\nWhat do you always need to get more?\nThe reverse used car salesman: What to say always to get more.

Recruiter deadlines and exploding offers are arbitrary. Most people are not proactive enough, control timing with a deterrent, and make themselves set the timelines. Tell them when you want the offers.\nCounterOffer\nThank you for your time and energy. I am excited about this opportunity because of its impact and growth. Let’s work together to find a comp package that works for both sides. To be transparent, I am in the early stages of my job search. I just got another offer from another tech company. Would it be impossible to meaningfully increase the total comp?\nMight be smart to name a number instead of doing the open type of question.\nOkay, you can’t do what we asked for, but make me your most improved offer, and I’ll give it my best consideration.\nLinks\n\nNever Split the Difference\nNonviolent Communication\nStart with No\nSalary Expectations\nWebsite on Salary Negotiation\nHow to sabotage your salary negotiations before you even start.\n50 min podcast about salary negotiation\nFearless Salary Negotiation Book on salary negotiating.\n\nThoughts\n\nIt would be smart to practice salary negotiation as well as interview techniques.\nAlways overshoot; no one will thank or reward you for being correct in your assumptions.\nDO NOT TELL THEM YOUR SALARY EXPECTATIONS.\nIt’s your job to be pushy at the offer stage.\nWe do not want to share any actionable info too early (Time, Money, Contracts/Offers). It is like dating; you withhold information to gain a positive perception.\nBe positive and helpful.\nIf they ask about your salary expectations, you want to have a good answer; I like Josh Doody´s example: “I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation,”\n\n\nIt is what the money says.

I have been quite fortunate to work with great managers, and this has inspired me to incorporate a lot of their wisdom into the way I work.\nManage to help\nAfter being both in a position to manage and being managed in my career, I have noticed a reactive trend among managers.  I think this trend, where a lot of the development is being put on oneself might be self-defeating. I get it, the motivation and reasoning behind it is good, that the one responsible for their development is the one taking charge of it, and that might be on paper a good thing. It most certainly is in line with the current zeitgeist of the times.\nHowever, I think we are missing a crucial aspect of management, which is a manager, you are supposed to have a broader perspective. I for one, did not know that I had weaknesses within one or other segments and could work on new things. I think as a manager, it is important to guide those you are managing to become the best they can be. And to do that, you need to give input. You should take the responsibility to identify the areas where there is room for improvement, and if the person do not have a grasp of where they want to go (understandably), you need to show them how.\nAs a manager, do not start personal development discussions as an open book, have a set of possible actions to take, and help the person identify the path instead of letting them figure it out. They will eventually figure it out (I most certainly did), but why make it cumbersome?\nCoaching\nI would like to write a little bit on the role of coaching and mentorship as a way to develop as a manager.\nI believe that coaching is one of the most underrated skills a leader can have.  Coaching is challenge and empathy, mixed together.\nWorking with people and coaching them is\nIn one of the places I was very lucky to work in, there was a concept called delivery coach (It was a consultancy). The concept was that a lot of the time, having a sparring partner was a huge boon to the productivity of the consultant. Having a veteran who lent their time to the project helped the juniors immensely to\nDunbars Number\nDunbar´s number is about the maximum amount of relationships one can have. As with all things related to psychology, one must take it with a grain of salt, but a manager needs to understand that the higher one reaches into the corporate ladder and the more people you have under you, the less time (and energy) you will have to enable those you are responsible to excel.  So you need to have a plan about not only how you can enable the ones “beneath” you to excel but also if you have the capacity to enable them to succeed. If not, you need to help them.\nLinks\n\nSome work on the management from an engineering perspective\nMVP versus MBI\nPeopleware\nManaging Humans\nThe Managers Path\nA death march, in a project management setting\nTime management for mangagers\n\nThoughts\n\nThis is also quite related to my experience as a tech lead.\n“Leadership matters and leadership is not sufficient”.

This pertains both to my experience working with tech leads as well as working in such a capacity.\nThe official role of tech lead is a bit confusing, as they don’t have managerial responsibilities but rather act as a bridge between technical and business roles.\nUnderstanding the System\nAs a tech lead, you not only need to have an understanding of the code base but the entire system. It is a bit like the so-called architect role but a more hands on in terms of competencies. An architect does not build.\nYou want the person designing the system to be able to build the system.\nAs a tech lead, take a lot of time to write the system diagrams and archtiecture of the system out, try to explain the system. Understand the reasinging and the purpose. Make sure that your technology choices are documented. You should ask yourself the questions, if you are comming into the project in 6 months, how will you get on board to understand the system.\nTech leads who are not collaborating, teaching, elvating the team is not a tech lead but a fool put in charge. Those who do not do this is not suited for the role.\nLinks\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\nCultural debt. A spin-off on the concept of technical debt. It is the increase of work needed to fix cultural aspects of the organization. It is the quintessential “we have always done it this way.”\nCode culture is a concept of having a culture of excellence and being consistently good. It is the small things. This is very relatable to the DevOps culture. I, for one, think that some of the things DevOps does are instill rules that serve as processes or guardrails. I, for one, think that working on creating good engineers and a good code culture is quite much more important.\nOne of the most important aspects of being a leader of engineers is instilling a sense of craftsmanship and pride in their work. This is one of the most important aspects of being there as a manager and a teacher for the junior engineers.\nWhen becomming a Manager or Tech Lead, be prepared for the fact that the closest you come coding will be a PR.\n"},"Working/Remote-Work":{"slug":"Working/Remote-Work","filePath":"Working/Remote Work.md","title":"Remote Work","links":["Books/Book-Reviews/Work/Productivity/Your-Brain-at-Work"],"tags":["remote-work","article","work","digital-nomad","productivity","travel"],"content":"Remote Work\nI did some remote working when I was at Bali, working primarily on my side projects.

It wasn’t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, “he drew people out, got them thinking.” More than anything, Nyquist asked good questions\nWhen you are having trouble and see that your time at a company is coming to an end, you send out feelers to other places.
