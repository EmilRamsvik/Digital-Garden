# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
Last book (for now) in the first law series. A good and interesting fantasy book in that it emulates the french revolution. I quite liked it and how it portrays a turbulent age where power dictates the fate of life. 

# 🎨 Impressions
Not many books are that interesting in that it portrays backstabbing, backroom deals and the mob as well. Good reading and fun to read. Would recommend based upon just the joy of reading. 

## How I Discovered It
The first law, needed to finish the second trilogy. 

## Who Should Read It?
People who like fantasy.
