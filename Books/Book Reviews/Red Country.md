# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
A fantasy book that takes inspiration from the wild west area, with impulses from a lot of different settings from previous books. Mostly a story about traveling and challenges, as well as a few twists and turns. Mostly a book that is easy to read. 

# 🎨 Impressions
I felt like this book was by far the weakest in the Joe Abercrombie series about the first law. By far the weakest. 
I felt like it was good to have read it but for the most part it was a boring read. Not much to say other than that.

## How I Discovered It
It was in the series on the first law etc. 

## Who Should Read It?
It was a bit of a standalone book, and i felt not much affected me reading about it. 

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
