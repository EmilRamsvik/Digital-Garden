# Coffee

Coffee is probably the drug I am most comfortable using. Caffeine is something I am definitely addicated to, and I am comfortable with that. 

Filter coffee works great, I have primarily used the standard [Moccamaster](https://www.jernia.no/inspirasjon/nordmenns-favoritt-kaffetrakter-i-50-ar/) filter machine. It works great and I am very happy with it. 

Lombok coffee and [Turkish coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee) are great when you dont have any equipment but don't want to use coffee.
