My Knowledge Wiki contains most of my knowledge (From 2023 onwards mostly). I try to gather all information I find interesting and my learnings in this wiki. The goal is to create a digital garden for my thoughts and share as much as possible of the things I find interesting. The goal is to have a comprehensive library for my thoughts and experiences that I can share with the world and look back on. 




## Methology
I believe that consistent work and updates are the keys to making good improvements. I am personally a fan of trying to make a quick standard that has at least some structure that can be expanded upon when making new choices. 


I want to make daily updates as long as it is possible and have created some incentives to do this. 

- I have created a task in my [[Apps#Streaks]] app for adding entries to the digital garden. 
- 
### Workflow
I have designed this basic workflow for how to make a daily entry and continuously improve the digital garden. 
#### CAE
CAE stands for Create, Add, Enhance and is a tasklist for daily entries. To work in the digital garden I use the term *item* to designate a standalone piece of text. An item should either be an article or a header with some text following it and should be an intelligent and clear piece of text that can be understood separately from other texts. 
- *Create* is that I want to create a new item in my knowledge hub. An Item is either a header or a new article. The goal is always to add new things to the garden. 
- *Add* is that I want to add something to an existing item. It can be a sentence or thought. The goal is to improve all items. If no particular things have been added then going through the unfinished list is good. 
- *Enhance* is that I should improve either a process or item during the daily entry. A process can be a script used in the digital garden or sorting the entries or fixing the style of some articles to the newest style. The goal is to continuously improve the items in the digital garden. The enhancement should be used on a different article than add. 
By using the CAE workflow, I can let the thought of always finishing things go and rather focus on writing for the fun of it. 

# Thoughts 
- I want to experiment with randomizing the daily entries, maybe creating a list of enhancements and articles I want to write about, themes, or others. 
- One particular fear I have is a lot of double entries, where I write the same thing over and over again.
